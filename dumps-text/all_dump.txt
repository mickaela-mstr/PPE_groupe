****** 10 Things You Probably Didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt Know About Washington Irving ******
Mar 22nd, 2018 /
BY Mark
Sunnyside / The_Legend_of_Sleepy_Hollow / Washington_Irving

[washington-irving-bust]
You know√Ç¬†The Legend of Sleepy Hollow√Ç¬†from the countless movies, cartoons and
other adaptations. The tale of√Ç¬†Rip Van Winkle√Ç¬†is thoroughly ingrained in
American culture. But how about the man behind the stories? As it turns out,
Washington Irving√¢¬Ä¬ôs life was just as interesting as the books he wrote. Here
are 10 things you might not know about America√¢¬Ä¬ôs first international best-
selling author.
1.√Ç¬†Irving was the last of 11 children, eight of whom lived into adulthood. His
older brothers often supported him as he pursued his writing interests, and he
started the literary magazine√Ç¬†Salmagundi√Ç¬†with his brother William.
2.√Ç¬†He was named after George Washington. Irving was born in 1783, the same
year the American Revolution came to an end. He was named after the war hero
and attended Washington√¢¬Ä¬ôs inauguration when he was 6 years old. In fact,
historians think that Irving√¢¬Ä¬ôs account of Washington√¢¬Ä¬ôs swearing-in created
the now-challenged story that Washington added √¢¬Ä¬úSo help me God√¢¬Ä¬ù to his oath
of office.
3.√Ç¬†In 1798, yellow fever had reached epidemic proportions in New York with
over 800 deaths. Fear of the disease drove the family to send Irving to stay
with a friend in Tarrytown. It was here that he would have gotten to know
Sleepy Hollow, which was to become the setting, of course, of his most famous
story, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.
4.√Ç¬†As a reporter for his brother Peter√¢¬Ä¬ôs newspaper, The Morning Chronicle,
Irving covered Aaron Burr√¢¬Ä¬ôs treason trial. He described the courtroom meeting
of Burr and his adversary General James Wilkinson, saying, ‚ÄúBurr turned his
head, looked him full in the face with one of his piercing regards, swept his
eye over his whole person from head to foot, as if to scan his dimensions, then
coolly resumed his former position.‚Äù
5.√Ç¬†He was engaged to Matilda Hoffman in 1808, but she died of tuberculosis
before they were wed. Irving was devastated and never married. Years later he
wrote to a friend about her death, saying, √¢¬Ä¬úFor years I could not talk on the
subject of this hopeless regret; I could not even mention her name; but her
image was continually before me, and I dreamt of her incessantly.√¢¬Ä¬ù
6.√Ç¬†Irving not only coined the word √¢¬Ä¬úGotham√¢¬Ä¬ù as a nickname for New York
City, he also helped establish the use of √¢¬Ä¬úknickerbocker√¢¬Ä¬ù as a name for New
Yorkers. √¢¬Ä¬úGotham√¢¬Ä¬ù was the name of the city lampooned in stories is his
literary magazine. √¢¬Ä¬úKnickerbocker√¢¬Ä¬ù was adapted from his book,√Ç¬†A History of
New York: From the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty, by
Diederich Knickerbocker.
Irving was also the origin of the phrase √¢¬Ä¬úthe almighty dollar,√¢¬Ä¬ù having
written in√Ç¬†The Creole Village,√Ç¬†√¢¬Ä¬úThe almighty dollar, that great object of
universal devotion throughout our land, seems to have no genuine devotees in
these peculiar villages; and unless some of its missionaries penetrate there,
and erect banking houses and other pious shrines, there is no knowing how long
the inhabitants may remain in their present state of contented poverty.√¢¬Ä¬ù
7.√Ç¬†It wouldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be a very merry Christmas without Irving. In a time when
Christmas wasn√¢¬Ä¬ôt widely celebrated, Irving helped create the modern image of
Santa Claus in√Ç¬†A History of New York.√Ç¬†He wrote about a man who dreamt that
‚Äúthe good St. Nicholas came riding over the tops of the trees, in that self-
same wagon wherein he brings his yearly presents to children.‚Äù He continued to
foster the Christmas tradition in√Ç¬†The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon,
Gent.,with stories like √¢¬Ä¬úChristmas Eve,√¢¬Ä¬ù which describes the then little-
known tradition of hanging mistletoe.
8.√Ç¬†Irving also had a hand in inventing the myth that people in the Middle Ages
thought the world was flat. In Irving√¢¬Ä¬ôs 1828 book√Ç¬†A History of the Life and
Voyages of Christopher Columbus,√Ç¬†he fictionalizes the meeting of the Spanish
commission that examines Columbus√¢¬Ä¬ô expedition plan, with members of the
committee raising objections to the idea that world was round. Readers accepted
Irving√¢¬Ä¬ôs version as truth, but in reality the educated class would have long
accepted the idea of a round earth.
9.√Ç¬†He bought his riverside home, Sunnyside, in 1835 for $1800, and he died of
a heart attack in his bedroom in 1859. The home was quite the tourist
attraction, with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. writing that Sunnyside was ‚Äúnext to
Mount Vernon, the best known and most cherished of all the dwellings in our
land.‚Äù
10.√Ç¬†In 1940, Irving was the first author to be featured on the √¢¬Ä¬úFamous
Americans√¢¬Ä¬ù series stamps. Other authors included in the series were James
Fenimore Cooper, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Louisa May Alcott, and Samuel Clemens.
Get to know Washington Irving even better. Plan a trip to Sunnyside, the
author‚Äôs charming riverside home.

****** 10 Blurred Lines around the Reality of the Slender Man Legends ******

We all know that the Slender Man is nothing more than a pure urban legend
created online in 2009 on an Internet forum. However, since then, it has taken
on a life of its own, even being connected with several attempted murders as
well as a spate of suicides and a possible mass suicide attempt.
While nobody is arguing that the Slender Man is real (at least in the physical
sense), the belief in him by some has made the consequences of the legend very
real for some. Here are ten very unsettling points about the legend and reality
of the Slender Man.

Slender Man: How The Internet Created a Monster | Monstrum
[Slender_Man:_How_The_Internet_Created_a_Monster_|_Monstrum]
Watch_this_video_on_YouTube
Unlike many other legends and myths, the origins of the Slender Man can be
traced to the exact date of its creation. At some point on June 10, 2009, the
Internet forum Something Awful unleashed two photographs. They were created by
user Victor Surge (whose real name was eventually revealed to be Eric Knudsen).
He had created them in response to a challenge by the forum‚Äôs admin‚Äîto create
‚Äúparanormal images‚Äù that might make people believe they were genuine.
The first picture, dating from 1983, showed a group of children looking upset
and frightened. In the background is a discreet, extraordinarily tall, faceless
man. The caption read: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt want to go, we didn‚Äôt want to kill them, but
its persistent silence and outstretched arms horrified us and comforted us at
the same time!‚Äù That quote was attributed to the unknown photographer, who was
‚Äúpresumed dead.‚Äù
The second picture was dated three years later, in 1986. It showed children
looking altogether happier while playing in a park. Discreetly, though, the
same tall figure can be seen lurking in the background. The caption informed
those who viewed the picture that it was ‚Äúone of two recovered photographs from
the Stirling City Library blaze.‚Äù It also stated that the photo was taken ‚Äúthe
day which fourteen children vanished‚Äù and even referenced ‚ÄúSlender Man.‚Äù This
time the photographer was ‚Äúnamed‚Äù as Mary Thomas, who had been missing since
June 1986.
These two pictures not only gave birth to the Slender Man legends, but they
also captivated thousands upon thousands of people almost immediately.[1]

Although Knudsen was responsible for the Slender Man‚Äôs creation, it would be
the many followers of Creepypasta who would truly bring him to life. As more
and more people became aware of Slender Man and added their own details and
little pieces of the backstory, the legend grew.
He was often depicted with a white, featureless face and was slim, abnormally
tall, and often with tentacles coming from his back. He also became associated
with abandoned buildings, often in the wilderness or the woods. Some details
added later even claimed that the Slender Man could teleport from one place to
another. Those who were interested in the Slender Man even ‚Äúagreed‚Äù signs that
he was near and watching you. Such signs as sudden paranoia, nosebleeds, and
intense nightmares.
In fact, this creation of a legend by the audience themselves is the subject of
our next point. How this growth can be monitored and studied by those who study
myths and folklore of the past.[2]

Myths, Fables, Legends, and Fairy Tales
[Myths,_Fables,_Legends,_and_Fairy_Tales]
Watch_this_video_on_YouTube
Many who study legends, folklore, and mythology have looked at the Slender Man
legends as a way of being able to document its growth and reach. And in doing
so, they look to understand how legends of the past might have developed and
grown in a similar way. For example, there is a collective element to the
growth of the Slender Man legend, as we examined above. What‚Äôs more, slight
details change depending on who is telling the tale or who the audience might
be. Indeed, the more accounts that were retold of the Slender Man (online as
opposed to orally, in this case), the more the legend and the backstory grew.
The Slender Man legend had very quickly taken on a life of its own, much like
myths and folklore of the past. However, several years after his creation, the
Slender Man became ‚Äúreal‚Äù in a much grittier way.[3]

On May 31, 2014, the Slender Man, or at least the consequences of the legend,
spilled over into the real world in a very dramatic way. On the morning in
question, two 12-year-old girls, Anissa Weier and Morgan Geyser, attempted to
murder their friend, Payton Leutner, by stabbing her multiple times in the
woods. After being left for dead, she eventually stumbled out and was
discovered by a passing cyclist.
The girls were arrested a short time later. When questioned, Weier claimed they
had launched the attack in order to please the Slender Man. What‚Äôs more, they
also believed they knew where the Slender Man lived (an old house in the
Nicolet National Forest), a location they were on their way to when they were
arrested.
For all intents and purposes, it could be argued that for the attackers and
their victim alike, the Slender Man, or the consequences of him, were very
real. Incidentally, Weier was released from a mental health facility in the
summer of 2021. Geyser, on the other hand, remains incarcerated. Payton Leutner
recovered from the nineteen stab wounds she received from her ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù[4]

[4_Times_Kids_Were_Motivated_To_Kill_Because_Of_Creepypastas_(Mostly

Watch_this_video_on_YouTube
Following the attempted murder of Payton Leutner, several copycat cases
occurred, all with various connections to the Slender Man legends. For example,
only weeks later, in June 2014, in Hamilton County, Ohio, a 13-year-old girl
attacked her mother with a knife. In the investigation that followed, it was
discovered that she had an ‚Äúobsession‚Äù with the Slender Man.
Several months after that, in September 2014, in Port Richey, Florida, a 14-
year-old girl set fire to her family home. According to reports, she was
‚Äòinspired‚Äô by the Slender Man to do so. Incidentally, all of those inside
escaped the burning building, and the young girl was arrested the following
morning.
Even the murders of two police officers and a member of the public in Las Vegas
in the summer of 2014, followed by the suicide of the alleged killer and his
wife, was connected to the Slender Man after neighbors told the media that he
would often dress up as the Internet legend and parade around his house and
yard.[5]
***** 5 Suicides Connected to the Slender Man *****
Walking Sam || Legend
[Walking_Sam_||_Legend]
Watch_this_video_on_YouTube
In the summer of 2015, The New York Times published an article detailing the
suicides of multiple young people between the ages of 12 and 24 who had
committed suicide on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota in the previous
six months alone. What is particularly interesting about this wave of suicides
is that the article also claimed that ‚Äúseveral officials with knowledge of the
cases said that at least one of the youths who committed suicide was influenced
by Slender Man.‚Äù
What is further interesting about the alleged connections to the Slender Man
legends and these tragic deaths are legends of the reservation itself. They
speak of a spirit named the Tall Man or Walking Sam. What this spirit did was
to encourage those he chose to visit to take their own lives. It is perhaps a
coincidence that there are similarities between the legends of the Slender Man
and these Native American legends. However, the coming together of them within
this reservation‚Äôs community very well might have resulted in tragic
consequences.[6]

A particularly grim account tells of a narrowly aborted mass suicide at the
same reservation mentioned above. According to the story, multiple teenagers
suddenly set out to a specific spot in the woods and started preparing ropes by
tying them to the branches of the trees. They were clearly planning on
committing suicide, hanging themselves together as a group.
The local pastor on the reservation, John Two Bulls, heard of the morose plans
and immediately set out to the location. He, fortunately, managed to halt the
proceedings and seemingly bring the group out of whatever mass-trance they
appeared to have been in.
Rumblings from the reservation claimed that the cause of the attempted mass
suicide was a result of the visitation of Walking Sam. Given the publicity that
the Slender Man was receiving at this stage, it is perhaps easy to understand
how some in the media connected the legend of the suicide spirit and this new
urban legend. [7]
***** 3 ‚ÄúLacy‚Äù ‚Äì A Truly Bizarre Account *****
Nick Redfern ‚Äì The Slenderman Mysteries
[Nick_Redfern_-_The_Slenderman_Mysteries]
Watch_this_video_on_YouTube
Paranormal author and researcher Nick Redfern relayed a particularly intriguing
account that was told to him. The witness‚Äîwho he gave the name ‚ÄúLacy‚Äù‚Äîwould
claim to have had several real-life encounters with the Slender Man, although
not physical encounters.
She would claim that she had been researching the Slender Man for several
months. Then, one evening, her laptop (which was on sleep mode) suddenly
switched on of its own accord. To her shock, an image of a faceless creature
was on the screen. Within a few seconds, it was gone. She told herself she must
have imagined it. However, two nights later, the laptop once more switched on
of its own accord. When it did, the face appeared again, only this time it was
much clearer.
Things went quiet for several weeks, and Lacy had almost forgotten the
incidents. That was until her laptop came on again. This time, a strange voice
came from the device stating, ‚Äúwe are friends.‚Äù It was at this point that Lacy
shut the laptop down and ceased her research into the Slender Man legends.
It is easy (and perhaps right) to suggest that what Lacy experienced, at best,
were hallucinations brought on by her intense interest in and subconscious fear
of the Slender Man legends. It is interesting to note once more, though, that
the fine line in a person believing in a legend suddenly ‚Äúmaking it real‚Äù is
indeed delicate in the extreme.[8]

***** 2 Intense Internet Debate *****
What If Slender Man Was Real?
[What_If_Slender_Man_Was_Real?]
Watch_this_video_on_YouTube
As we might imagine, a fierce debate ensued following the attempting stabbing
and the copycat cases that followed. And while it concentrated on the Slender
Man at first, it soon moved on to the Internet and the influence it has on
children in general. For example, in the Waukesha School District, where the
attempted murder of Payton Leutner took place, Creepypasta Wiki was blocked.
For their part, the administrators of the website claimed that the stabbing was
an ‚Äúisolated incident.‚Äù They also claimed their website was a literary one and
not one that condoned murder.
Ultimately, it was reasoned that all manner of films, TV programs, and video
games that children had access to did not result in such atrocious attacks. In
short, the problem was with the attackers themselves as opposed to the apparent
catalyst. Although the debate originally had momentum, the more it went on, the
less sway it had.[9]
***** 1 A Contemporary Equivalent of the Boogeyman *****
Folklore ‚Äì The Boogie Man
[Folklore_-_The_Boogie_Man]
Watch_this_video_on_YouTube
There is little doubt that the Slender Man is the Boogeyman of the modern age.
If you talk to anyone in the western world under the age of 20, it is almost
certain they will know who the Slender Man is. They might not know the history
or even how they heard of him, but the fact is, they know. And although they
understand‚Äîat least for the most part‚Äîthat he is nothing more than an urban
legend, he is without a doubt in their collective subconscious.
There are certainly very definite similarities between the Slender Man and the
Boogeyman. Both are on the prowl for children, for example, and both have grim
abodes in out-of-the-way locations, often in the woods.
Of course, where the legend of the Slender Man goes from here remains to be
seen. Perhaps he will still be spoken in hundreds of years by spooked
youngsters around the world as much as he is today.[10]

****** The Legend of Arsene Wenger ******
If Arsene Wenger‚Äôs career was a kung fu movie, we would be in the part where
the search is on for the villain who poisoned Arsene‚Äôs rice. Taking cues from
the charismatic Frenchman, all eyes would be on the usual suspects, the media,
referees, disloyal players, Roy Keane, Sam Allardyce, and the most obvious
targets, those pin-stripe-suited figures throwing around Scrooge McDuck money
for fun. But this film‚Äôs twist is that Arsene may have stubbornly poisoned his
own rice.
Without question, Arsene Wenger‚Äôs footballing philosophy is the stuff of
legends, the kind of stuff that inevitably leads to statues and shops with
corny names. It is a presence in football that can‚Äôt quite be contextualized
and fully appreciated until you run down a laundry list of coaches and realize
how few have recognizable philosophies capable of lining up with the world‚Äôs
great ‚Äìisms, communism, socialism, capitalism, Barcelonaism. But as with all
great ‚Äìisms, there‚Äôs a downside, and Wengerism is no exception to this time-
tested rule. As a great man who I may have made up once said, ‚ÄúShifting
landscapes wait for no philosophy.‚Äù
Back in 1996, Wengerism took the world by surprise, and by world, of course, I
mean England. Arsene was a career coach with multiple successes under his belt,
but his body of work didn‚Äôt quite resonate on a global scale until he
replicated his successes at Arsenal, transforming the club and English football
along the way. His philosophy was built by tapping into a continental pool of
players that had yet to be realized or trusted by his peers in England. Add the
Japanese-inspired modifications to the traditional, English training regimen
and some good old-fashioned outside-the-box thinking and the insightful Arsene
was well on his way to transforming an English league that, in many ways, was
in desperate need of modernization.
Wengerism quickly became easily identifiable. Movement, pace, obscene technical
ability, disregard for passports, and a dedication to healthy living
collectively became Arsene‚Äôs ayahuasca (an Amazonian psychedelic drug thought
to transform how you view the world). Over his first few years, England stood
transfixed as if in a drug-induced state. The world inhaled. And then inhaled
again. I certainly did. Multiple times.
Few could outrun Wenger‚Äôs newest disciples, an amalgamation of good old-
fashioned Englishmen, seemingly random foreigners, and a superhero Dutchman who
was scared of flying. The trophies were immediate and people soon began lining
up around the corner to devour the teachings on tap at Highbury. Suddenly, a
Frenchman was the philosopher-king of English football. He was ‚ÄúThe Professor,‚Äù
the robed, noble Frenchman sitting on the side of the pitch with his Coke
bottle glasses telling the world that the era of English football as we knew it
was over. Fini.
Mesmerized, slightly disoriented fans and media types weren‚Äôt the only ones to
succumb to Wengerism. Arsene, susceptible to the trappings of success just like
previous purveyors of transformative thought, also bought into Wengerism. And
that‚Äôs where the trouble begins. No philosophy, not even the most
transformative, should go unchallenged forever.
Looking at the human record, there are countless examples of what happens when
individuals develop philosophies that successfully end up radically
transforming thought and/or behavior. Often, these typically charismatic
figures peak, which is then followed by a slow procession into a delusional
state characterized by a fierce bond to the glory days and a perpetual belief
that a formula that was once all the rage will be so again. It‚Äôs just a matter
of time, isn‚Äôt it? That‚Äôs the worrying and poisonous component of success.
Sure, it‚Äôs not an absolute; it doesn‚Äôt cripple everyone. But Arsene‚Äôs steadfast
reliance on a philosophy that initially brought success just might be the very
poison that leads to his demise. Said another way, Arsene may have unknowingly
betrayed himself.
Arsene transformed football by keeping his mind open to new approaches and
angles. He absorbed what leagues and cultures had to offer and hit the English
scene at the right time, with the right recipe. But since then, one way to view
Arsene‚Äôs stance is that he has stood still, staunch in his belief that his
philosophy is the end. The irony is that this highly cerebral being may have
reached a point of success only to discard the one thing that brought him
success: an open mind.
All philosophies must evolve, and like all hardened souls who have doubled down
on their philosophies as gospel after initial successes learn, being right and
successful at a specific point in time doesn‚Äôt make you right for eternity, or
right under all conditions. The Arsenal philosophy worked with a certain set of
players at a certain point in time in a certain market, almost to perfection.
But unfortunately for Arsenal, we no longer live in that world. Arsene no
longer has the jump on foreign markets. No longer are there remote corners of
the globe. Globalization has arrived and what was once Wenger‚Äôs Coca Cola
formula is now public knowledge. Now, the race for continental talent, the
talent necessary to execute football ‚ÄúThe Arsenal Way‚Ñ¢,‚Äù can be purchased by
anyone with access to mines, oil, or vast resources of chicken. No longer is
Arsene‚Äôs spell, alone, enough to draw players who can now express themselves at
much higher salaries elsewhere. Yet, for some reason, we still reflexively talk
about sexy football at Arsenal. Why? If we are being honest, sexy football
hasn‚Äôt been around for some time. All you need to do is look at the style that
was on display at Highbury a decade ago (which admittedly is a high standard
for any team) to see how the latest versions of the team are much closer to
Inconvincible than Invincible. Check your bowl, Arsene may have poisoned your
rice, too.
We‚Äôre all wondering how this movie ends. Does Arsene take his own life by
continuing to eat his poisoned rice, or is there another twist, a twist where
the director reveals that Arsene has actually mastered skills taught at
competing monasteries and defeats Manchester City in the final fight scene
using Qatar-style?
At first glance, changing Arsene may be as difficult a task as convincing
Chairman Mao to accept capitalism, or convincing Richard Dawkins to accept
Jesus as his savior. But regardless of what he decides, the landscape around
him will continue to change. That is inevitable. It is also likely we will
inevitably learn that training young players to compete The Arsenal Way‚Ñ¢, only
to break through and find out that other teams have already explored the world
and brought in experienced players already capable of playing The Arsenal Way‚Ñ¢
while selling farm-raised Arsenal Way‚Ñ¢ players to these same clubs is a suspect
formula, and one that looks to be unsustainable.
Arsene has a strong, commendable philosophy, but if he wants to continue being
a savior and avoid end-of-career buffoonery and caricature, he must learn to
proactively introduce experienced, serious talent into his team, or risk losing
the reputation that he has spent his life rightfully developing. I wish it
didn‚Äôt work that way. It isn‚Äôt fair. But it is 2011, and today, reputations are
easier than ever to build. They are also notoriously easy to dismantle,
bastardize and destroy.
But it isn‚Äôt all doom and gloom. If you are wearing your prescription, rose-
tinted glasses, the potentially good news is that Arsene already knows all of
this. It has now come out that back when Arsenal was in desperate need for a
goalkeeper, they bid ¬£20 million for Liverpool‚Äôs Pepe Reina. They seemingly
made bids for Borussia Dortmund playmaker Mario G√∂tze, Lyon playmaker Yoann
Gourcuff, Rennes holding midfielder Yann M‚ÄôVila, and maybe even Lille hotshot
Eden Hazard. Each of these bids, and these are only some of the ones that have
surfaced, would have broken Arsenal‚Äôs record transfer fee. These bids suggest
one important thing: Arsene knows and he‚Äôs now willing to spend well beyond
what he has spent in the past. Whether he‚Äôs willing to spend enough is another
question. So the potentially good news for Arsenal fans is that Arsene‚Äôs
poisoned rice may not kill him, but rather, might have strengthened his
immunity and expanded his powers. He may just be waiting for the right moment
in the movie to maintain the appropriate level of suspense. If this is the
case, this kung fu movie may have one last hilarious, unexpected turn.
In the meantime, keep your eye on your rice.

This much-debated photo from 1934 may be iconic, but the legend of the Loch
Ness Monster dates back to before the Roman invasion of the region.

**** birth of a legend ****
When the Romans first came to northern Scotland in the first century A.D., they
found the Highlands occupied by fierce, tattoo-covered tribes they called the
Picts, or painted people. From the carved, standing stones still found in the
region around Loch Ness, it is clear the Picts were fascinated by animals, and
careful to render them with great fidelity. All the animals depicted on the
Pictish stones are lifelike and easily recognizable‚Äîall but one. The exception
is a strange beast with an elongated beak or muzzle, a head locket or spout,
and flippers instead of feet. Described by some scholars as a swimming
elephant, the Pictish beast is the earliest known evidence for an idea that has
held sway in the Scottish Highlands for at least 1,500 years‚Äîthat Loch Ness is
home to a mysterious aquatic animal.
In Scottish folklore, large animals have been associated with many bodies of
water, from small streams to the largest lakes, often labeled Loch-na-Beistie
on old maps. These water-horses, or water-kelpies, are said to have magical
powers and malevolent intentions. According to one version of the legend, the
water-horse lures small children into the water by offering them rides on its
back. Once the children are aboard, their hands become stuck to the beast and
they are dragged to a watery death, their livers washing ashore the following
day.
The earliest written reference linking such creatures to Loch Ness is in the
biography of Saint Columba, the man credited with introducing Christianity to
Scotland. In A.D. 565, according to this account, Columba was on his way to
visit a Pictish king when he stopped along the shore of Loch Ness. Seeing a
large beast about to attack a man who was swimming in the lake, Columba raised
his hand, invoking the name of God and commanding the monster to "go back with
all speed." The beast complied, and the swimmer was saved.

[Daily Mail newspaper headline of Loch Ness] The Loch Ness Monster has been
headline news all over the world for more than 60 years.
Daily Mail

When Nicholas Witchell, a future BBC correspondent, researched the history of
the legend for his 1974 bookThe Loch Ness Story,he found about a dozen pre-
20th-century references to large animals in Loch Ness, gradually shifting in
character from these clearly mythical accounts to something more like
eyewitness descriptions.
**** a 20th-century sensation ****
The modern legend of Loch Ness dates from 1933, when a new road was completed
along the shore, offering the first clear views of the loch from the northern
side. One April afternoon, a local couple was driving home along this road when
they spotted "an enormous animal rolling and plunging on the surface." Their
account was written up by a correspondent for theInverness Courier,whose editor
used the word "monster" to describe the animal. The Loch Ness Monster has been
a media phenomenon ever since.
Public interest built gradually during the spring of 1933, then picked up
sharply after a couple reported seeing one of the creatures on land, lumbering
across the shore road. By October, several London newspapers had sent
correspondents to Scotland, and radio programs were being interrupted to bring
listeners the latest news from the loch. A British circus offered a reward of
¬£20,000 for the capture of the beast. Hundreds of boy scouts and outdoorsmen
arrived, some venturing out in small boats, others setting up deck chairs and
waiting expectantly for the monster to appear.
The excitement over the monster reached a fever pitch in December, when
theLondon Daily Mailhired an actor, film director, and big-game hunter named
Marmaduke Wetherell to track down the beast. After only a few days at the loch,
Wetherell reported finding the fresh footprints of a large, four-toed animal.
He estimated it to be 20 feet long. With great fanfare, Wetherell made plaster
casts of the footprints and, just before Christmas, sent them off to the
Natural History Museum in London for analysis. While the world waited for the
museum zoologists to return from holiday, legions of monster hunters descended
on Loch Ness, filling the local hotels. Inverness was floodlit for the
occasion, and traffic jammed the shoreline roads in both directions.

ABC News

The bubble burst in early January, when museum zoologists announced that the
footprints were those of a hippopotamus. They had been made with a stuffed
hippo foot‚Äîthe base of an umbrella stand or ashtray. It wasn&#x27;t clear
whether Wetherell was the perpetrator of the hoax or its gullible victim.
Either way, the incident tainted the image of the Loch Ness Monster and
discouraged serious investigation of the phenomenon. For the next three
decades, most scientists scornfully dismissed reports of strange animals in the
loch. Those sightings that weren&#x27;t outright hoaxes, they said, were the
result of optical illusions caused by boat wakes, wind slicks, floating logs,
otters, ducks, or swimming deer.
**** Saw Something, They Did ****
Nevertheless, eyewitnesses continued to come forward with accounts of their
sightings‚Äîmore than 4,000 of them, according to Witchell&#x27;s estimate. Most
of the witnesses described a large creature with one or more humps protruding
above the surface like the hull of an upturned boat. Others reported seeing a
long neck or flippers. What was most remarkable, however, was that many of the
eyewitnesses were sober, level-headed people: lawyers and priests, scientists
and school teachers, policemen and fishermen‚Äîeven a Nobel Prize winner.
In the 1950s, a local doctor named Constance Whyte began collecting these
eyewitness accounts, along with sketches of what the people had seen, finally
publishing them in 1957 as a book entitledMore Than a Legend.Noting that many
of her friends had been subjected to ridicule and contempt, Whyte said her goal
in writing the book was "the vindication of many people of integrity who had
reported honestly what they had seen in Loch Ness." (To hear recent personal
anecdotes, see Eyewitness_Accounts.)
[car with camera] In the 1960s a group of dedicated amateurs formed the Loch
Ness Investigation Bureau to keep a constant vigil on the loch.
BBC-Tomorrow&#x27;s World

Whyte&#x27;s book inspired a new generation of monster hunters, including Tim
Dinsdale, who on his first visit to the loch in 1960 took an intriguing film of
something moving across the loch‚Äîand promptly gave up his career as an
aeronautical engineer to devote his life to pursuing the monster. The next
year, a group of dedicated amateurs formed the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau,
keeping a constant vigil on the loch from an observation post on the northern
shore.
But perhaps the most important effect of Whyte&#x27;s book was to turn the tide
of public opinion. Long dismissed as fodder for "silly season" press reports,
Nessie was finally considered a subject worthy of serious scientific
investigation. In the span of a decade, beginning in 1958, four separate
expeditions were launched, first by the BBC, then by three respected British
universities: Oxford, Cambridge, and the University of Birmingham. Rather than
scanning the surface with binoculars and cameras, as the amateur investigators
had, these expeditions came equipped with sonar, a military technology that
used sound to search the underwater environment. Though the expeditions found
nothing conclusive, in each case the sonar operators detected large, moving
underwater objects they could not explain. (To learn how sonar works, see
Experiment_with_Sonar.)
 In 1987, Operation Deep Scan, the most ambitious sonar survey of Loch Ness,
found three unexplained underwater targets.
North Scene Video

**** high-tech searches ****
The use of technology to search the loch reached a new level in the 1970s, when
a series of expeditions was sponsored by the Boston-based Academy of Applied
Science, whose members included many technically skilled people with ties to
MIT. The Academy&#x27;s approach was to set a trap for the monster by combining
sonar and underwater photography for the first time. Under the leadership of
Robert Rines, a lawyer trained in physics, the team pointed a sophisticated
form of sonar, called side scan sonar, out into Loch Ness from a point near the
shore. Nearby they placed an underwater camera taking pictures every 45 seconds
as a strobe light illuminated the depths with a bright flash. The system paid
off one night in 1975. At the same moment the sonar was registering a large,
moving object, the underwater camera was taking pictures of an object that
looked, after development and computer enhancement, like the flippers of an
aquatic creature.
Rines&#x27; discovery won the support of two reputable scientists: Harold "Doc"
Edgerton, the legendary MIT scientist who had invented side scan sonar and
strobe photography; and Sir Peter Scott, one of Britain&#x27;s most respected
naturalists. With Edgerton and Scott behind him, Rines was given an opportunity
to present his evidence at a hearing at the House of Commons in London. Never
had the possibility of the Loch Ness Monster been taken so seriously.
Almost immediately, however, critics began to raise questions about the
evidence. Could the suggestive sonar traces be the result of human error? Had
the flipper photos been altered to improve their appearance? Just as damaging
to Rines&#x27; case was Peter Scott&#x27;s bold pronouncement about the
identity of the creature. Based on the flipper photos and the eyewitness
sightings, Scott concluded that Nessie was a plesiosaur, an ancient reptile
that was thought to have gone extinct along with the dinosaurs some 65 million
years ago. The idea was just too far-fetched for professional zoologists to
take seriously.

naturalist, helped create the popular image of Nessie as an ancient reptile
called a plesiosaur.

Although zoologists have yet to conduct the full-scale investigation Rines
hoped to trigger, the loch continues to yield intriguing sonar hits. In 1987,
an expedition called Operation Deep Scan used a flotilla of 20 sonar-equipped
boats to sweep the loch with a curtain of sound; the operation yielded three
underwater targets that could not be explained. In the early 1990s, the
BBC&#x27;s Nicholas Witchell helped organize Project Urquhart, the first
extensive study of the loch&#x27;s biology and geology. Although they
weren&#x27;t looking for monsters, the expedition&#x27;s sonar operators
detected a large, moving underwater target and followed it for several minutes
before losing it. And during the 1997 expedition featured in NOVA&#x27;s Loch
Ness film, Rines and his longtime colleague Charles Wyckoff detected yet
another puzzling underwater target. According to the expedition&#x27;s sonar
expert, marine biologist Arne Carr, it was a moving target, appeared to be
biological in nature, and was about 15 feet long‚Äîthe size of a small whale.
**** Famous Photo Falsified? ****
In the 65 years since the birth of the modern legend, dozens of people have
come forward with photographs purporting to show the monster. Most were quickly
dismissed as either outright frauds or images of ordinary objects mistaken for
monsters. But one photo stood above the rest. Taken in 1934, it shows what
appears to be the slender neck of an animal rising from the surface of the
water. From the moment it was published in theLondon Daily Mail,it became the
very image of the Loch Ness Monster and, for many, the strongest evidence that
Nessie actually exists.
 The "surgeon&#x27;s photo," published in 1934, became the very image of the
Loch Ness Monster.

One reason the photograph had such an impact on the Loch Ness legend was that
it came from such a credible source. The photo was sold to theDaily Mailby a
London physician named R. Kenneth Wilson, who said he had taken the picture
when he noticed a commotion in the water as he was driving up from London to
photograph birds with a friend near Inverness. Few believed that such a
respected doctor could be party to a deception.
[R. Kenneth Wilson] The credibility of the surgeon&#x27;s photo hinged on its
source‚Äîa respected London doctor named R. Kenneth Wilson.

But in 1994, 60 years after the photo was first published, newspapers around
the world reported the claim that the "surgeon&#x27;s photo" was a fake, part
of an elaborate plot to dupe theDaily Mail.The man behind the story was a
former English art teacher named Alastair Boyd, who had become an avid student
of Loch Ness lore after he and his wife had had their own sighting of a large
animal in the loch in 1979. Years later, a friend of Boyd&#x27;s named David
Martin discovered an old newspaper clipping in which Ian Wetherell (the son of
Marmaduke Wetherell of hippo foot fame) claimed the surgeon&#x27;s photo was a
hoax. The article had attracted little attention when it was published in 1975,
but two details caught Boyd&#x27;s eye.
First, Wetherell said the plot had involved a man named Maurice Chambers‚Äîthe
very same man that Dr. Wilson said he had driven up from London to visit in
1934. Second, Wetherell mentioned that the surgeon&#x27;s photograph included
the scenery of Loch Ness in the background. In fact, the familiar Nessie photo
includes only the protruding neck and the water around it. Boyd knew that the
original photo had included a bit of the far shoreline in the background,
because he had rediscovered the uncropped version in the late &#x27;80s. But
that full photo had been published only once, in 1934. So how could Wetherell
have known this detail? "Either he had a very long memory, or he took the
picture," Boyd says.
[surgeon&#x27;s photo uncropped] The full, uncropped surgeon&#x27;s photo,
published only once in 1934, was rediscovered by Boyd more than 50 years later.
Fortean Pictures Library

Ian Wetherell had died by the time Boyd and Martin read the article, but they
were able to track down his step-brother, Christian Spurling, in the south of
England. Spurling, 93 and near death, confessed. Unhappy with the way he was
treated by theDaily Mailafter the hippo foot fiasco, Duke Wetherell had set out
to get his revenge, enlisting his son and step-son in the plot. First Spurling
built a model monster by grafting a head and neck onto the conning tower of a
toy submarine. Then Wetherell and his son Ian drove up to the loch and staged
the photograph, taking care to include the actual Loch Ness scenery in the
background. Finally, to conceal his own role in the hoax, Wetherell persuaded
Dr. Wilson, through their common friend Chambers, to have the photo developed
and sell it to theDaily Mailas his own. The plot worked better than any of them
could have imagined.
Not everyone accepts the Spurling story. American journalist Richard Smith, for
example, notes that toy experts question whether the toy submarines of the
1930s could have performed as described, and he wonders why Boyd waited until
after Spurling&#x27;s death to reveal his confession. But in the aftermath of
Boyd&#x27;s 1994 bombshell, most people now believe the surgeon&#x27;s photo
was yet another Loch Ness hoax.
 The 93-year-old stepson of Marmaduke Wetherell told Boyd he made the monster
in the picture by grafting a plastic wood neck to a toy submarine.

Does that finally disprove the monster&#x27;s existence? Not at all, says Boyd.
One of the great ironies of the Loch Ness story is that the man who brought
down the most famous piece of evidence remains a firm believer in Nessie. "I am
so convinced of the reality of these creatures that I would actually stake my
life on their existence," he told NOVA. "I trust my eyesight ... I used to make
my living teaching people how to observe, and I know that the thing I saw was
not a log or an otter or a wave, or anything like that. It was a large animal.
It came heaving out of the water, something like a whale. I mean, the part that
was actually on the surface when it stopped rolling through was at least 20
feet long. It was totally extraordinary. It&#x27;s the most amazing thing
I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life, and if I could afford to spend the rest of my
life looking for another glimpse of it, I would."

****** Irving‚Äôs ‚ÄòLegend‚Äô: The Story Behind the Story ******
Sep 9th, 2015 /
BY Karen
Home_of_the_Legend / Irving's_Legend / Old_Dutch_Church / Sunnyside / The
Legend_of_Sleepy_Hollow / Washington_Irving

s Legend"">
Beloved by generations of readers, Washington Irving‚Äôs ‚ÄúLegend of Sleepy
Hollow‚Äù ranks among the classics of American literature.
Although it is one of Irving‚Äôs shortest works, it has had a long life since it
first was published in 1820. For nearly 200 years, the story has captured the
imagination of both children and adults. The characters, setting, and events
come alive through Irving‚Äôs descriptions, and artists of all types have used
the story for source material. From shortly after the story‚Äôs first publication
until today, the story has inspired creative works: illustrations, paintings,
sculpture, music, films, television shows, even advertising.
The Story
‚ÄúLegend‚Äù possesses elements of a thriller, but at the heart of the tale is a
love triangle set in Sleepy Hollow on the shore of the Hudson River at the turn
of the 19th century. Ichabod Crane, an itinerant schoolteacher, falls for
Katrina Van Tassel, the pretty daughter of a prosperous local family. Ichabod‚Äôs
gangling appearance and odd habits, as well as his obvious attraction to
Katrina, make him an easy target for Katrina‚Äôs other suitor, Brom Bones, the
swaggering village ‚Äúblade‚Äù in Irving‚Äôs description. Tension builds between Brom
and Ichabod until one dark autumn night when Ichabod, riding along a lonely
wooded road, finds himself with a ghostly headless companion. Overwhelmed by
fear and all the spooky tales he has heard, Ichabod flees, hoping to reach the
security of the nearby bridge and churchyard. The horseman gives chase and just
as Ichabod reaches safety, the horseman throws what appears to be his head at
the schoolteacher. The next day Ichabod cannot be found, but the villagers
discover his horse and the remains of a pumpkin, leaving the reader to
speculate as to what happened. Was Ichabod‚Äôs encounter with a true ghost? Or
was he the victim of a cruel prank?
Irving‚Äôs inspirations
Irving wrote ‚ÄúLegend‚Äù while living in England. Some scholars suggest Irving‚Äôs
tale may have been inspired by folk stories he heard during his time abroad.
German, English and Scandinavian folktales involving a headless rider chasing
hapless travelers have been told for many generations. Irving may have heard or
read versions of these tales and reimagined his own iteration in the Hudson
River Valley setting he knew so well. The author incorporated many local names
and details, adding an air of authenticity to his telling. He also claimed that
the original text was ‚Äúfound among the papers of the late Diedrich
Knickerbocker‚Äù who, in turn, heard the tale recounted by a ‚Äúpleasant, shabby,
gentlemanly old fellow‚Äù some years earlier. These layers of authorship remind
readers of the essential nature of a legend, a story told and retold by
tradition and no longer verifiable.
Critical Success
‚ÄúLegend‚Äù formed part of The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, a set of stories
written by Irving and published in installments in 1819 and 1820. Very quickly
readers latched on to Irving‚Äôs work. Good reviews from Irving‚Äôs influential
literary friends helped, but critics outside his circle raved too. English
critics were favorably impressed that an American author could write so well,
and Irving delighted in having upended English literary prejudices. Multiple
reprints and editions followed in England and in the United States as well as
foreign-language translations.
The early literary success of The Sketch Book helped Irving to build his career
as a writer and eventually enabled him to purchase Sunnyside, make improvements
to the property and help his family members financially. ‚ÄúLegend‚Äù has never
been out of print since it first was published. Irving wrote many other works,
but arguably ‚ÄúLegend‚Äù remains the most popular, perhaps because fans of the
story love to be a bit frightened, imagining themselves in Ichabod‚Äôs saddle,
fleeing for their lives from a headless phantom.
A Part of Popular Culture
Irving makes no mention of Halloween in his tale; rather he set the climax in
the evening of a ‚Äúfine autumnal day.‚Äù The ghostly and frightening elements of
the tale, however, mean it is now closely associated with the holiday. The link
is strengthened by artists who have shown the horseman carrying a scary jack-o-
lantern as a head, embellishing what Irving only suggests: that the horseman‚Äôs
‚Äúhead‚Äù was actually a pumpkin.
Thanks to the wide readership of Irving‚Äôs story, now combined with the number
of people who know one of the many children‚Äôs editions, comic books, animated
cartoons, films or television shows inspired by the tale, the characters are
well known and easily identified. They have been appropriated and reimagined,
and, as a result, have become even further embedded in American popular
culture. Through new vehicles and representations, Irving‚Äôs tale keeps
audiences amused, captivated and terrified after nearly two centuries.

It is wholly possible that you have come across an adaptation of Arthurian
legend at some point in your life. After all, there have been so many
interpretations across varying genres and media that an_entire_Wikipedia_page
has_been_dedicated_to_listing_them_all. One of the most well-known works
includes Sir Thomas Malory‚Äôs Le Morte d‚ÄôArthur. It has been deemed the most
extensive and culturally important work based on Arthurian legends. This is
because it goes in-depth into the histories of many characters, notably the
more prominent Knights of the Round Table and Arthur himself. Le Morte d‚ÄôArthur
has inspired other great works, such as T.H. White‚Äôs The Once and Future King.
Arthurian legends have also been often referenced in parodies, such as Monty
Python and the third Shrek movie. With all these different retellings of
Arthurian legend, it becomes clear that they are widely celebrated even within
pop culture. That leads us to the question, why are Arthurian legends so
popular in the first place?
The general storyline of Arthurian legends goes something like this: Arthur,
guided by the eccentric wizard Merlin, obtains the legendary sword Excalibur
and becomes King of Camelot. In some versions, he acquires the sword from the
Lady of the Lake. In others, he retrieves the sword from its immovable place in
stone. He then held court in Camelot and was aided by the many Knights of the
Round Table, his rule peaceful and prosperous. Eventually, King Arthur and the
Knights set off on a quest to find the immortality-granting Holy Grail. While
they are away, Lancelot, one of the Knights of the Round Table, engages in
adultery with Queen Guinevere. An enraged King Arthur starts a civil war upon
receiving word of the affair. However, King Arthur‚Äôs rule was ultimately
brought to an end when he was betrayed by the Camelot‚Äôs regent, Mordred, who
sought to seize the throne for himself. The resulting battle ended with both
King Arthur and Mordred meeting their demise. After his death, King Arthur was
sent on a boat to Avalon, where he is presumed to remain until today. It is
said that someday when Great Britain is in dire need, King Arthur will return
to save his people.
It is likely that Arthurian legends are popular due to its character archetypes
and storytelling. Arthurian legends feature characters that possess distinct
personalities or capabilities yet still leave a lot of room open for
interpretation. This is especially the case for characters who are fan
favourites, including Merlin, Morgan le Fay, and Lancelot. There are retellings
centred around these specific characters. For instance, BBC‚Äôs Merlin series and
1974 French drama Lancelot_du_Lac. Many characters in Arthurian legends
represent beloved archetypes commonly found in literature. As an example, King
Arthur expectedly falls under the Hero archetype. This is evident through his
tremendous courage and dignity making him the perfect example of chivalry. He
is able to triumph in multiple challenges throughout his life and manages to
ensure peace while he remains King. Archetypes can also be easily assigned to
other characters in Arthurian legend. An example would be Merlin, who falls
under the Mentor archetype. Equipped with knowledge and magical abilities,
Merlin acted as an advisor to Arthur as he was growing up, hence becoming a
great influence to Arthur. The Hero and Mentor archetypes as well as styles of
character have been replicated in famous works, for example Aragorn and Gandalf
respectively from J.R.R. Tolkien‚Äôs Lord of the Rings trilogy. Character tropes
are still commonly used in the realms of fiction and literature. They are
viewed as incredibly important as they are able to depict particular aspects of
human nature and life, thus constructing a sense of familiarity for readers or
the audiences of a variety of media. Another reason attributing¬† to the
perseverance of archetypes include linking_the_current_text_to_established
identities_in_other_past_works, therefore adding supplementary meaning to the
text. Consequently, it is not exceptional to discover that numerous characters
and plots resemble or overlap with that of Arthurian legends, which have served
as models or inspiration for later works.¬†¬†
Furthermore, Arthurian legends may be well-received due to the mystery
involved. There is no definite storyline as Arthurian legends are pieced
together from a number of different sources. There is no confirmation on which
version is the original, adding to the intrigue revolving around the tales.
Arthur‚Äôs birth and life have even become a point of research for historians,
while_some_scholars_claim_that_he_is_a_Celtic_deity-_others_assume_that_he_was
a_real_person_of_Romano-Briton_origins. However, it is not only Arthur that is
subjected to such ambiguity. The characters and settings surrounding him also
vary in terms of their history and moral alignment. Take Morgan le Fay for
example. She is portrayed as an evil sorceress in some versions but is shown as
a benevolent healer who laid Arthur to rest at Avalon. As Arthurian legends are
known to end on a cliffhanger (hence Arthur is known as the Once and Future
King), it is generally agreed upon that the period of time in which he
presumably ruled ‚Äì the Golden Age, has passed while the true question of ‚Äúwhen
will he be back?‚Äù is left unanswered. The obscurity of the source material
gives artists and creators the freedom to come up with their own versions of
the characters and the story based on their own takes and perspectives. The
temptations of filling in plot holes or exploring different parts of Arthurian
legends may prove to be too alluring to withstand for storytellers. Apart from
fiction, it is perhaps because we know so much yet so little of Arthurian
legends that academic research on the very subject is still carried out today.
As curator Dr ap Huw mentions, the_appeal_of_Arthur_is_that_he_was_or_is
‚Äúwhoever_you_want_him_to_be‚Äù.

Sure, Arthurian legends may be popular, but at the possible expense of angering
Arthurian scholars and fans, are the legends actually important? The answer to
this is subjective and depends on the audience‚Äôs opinions. Still, it cannot be
denied that the legends are classics that illustrate an important piece of
history, no matter Arthur‚Äôs status as real or fiction. Like fairytales, they
are a snapshot of how and what people‚Äôs beliefs were like at the time.
Arthurian legends have also been proved to withstand the test of time from
mediaeval to the modern era. As mentioned, they have been revamped a great
number of times in the form of official published works to writings across
fanfiction sites, although essentially all Arthur retellings are fanfiction of
sorts. It has become a cultural work of considerable significance and its
enduring popularity demonstrates that the legends are still fully capable of
attracting a sizable audience, old, young and anywhere in between. The many
adaptations of Arthurian legends in the fantasy genre like C.S. Lewis‚Äô The
Chronicles of Narnia and even George Lucas‚Äô Star Wars, undoubtedly attest to
the legends‚Äô influence. Not only have they been featured heavily in fiction and
academia, aspects of it, namely Excalibur and mediaeval armour, have also made
circles in the fashion world as seen in the form of Italian_designer_Alberta
Ferretti‚Äôs_limited_edition_collection_inspired_by_King_Arthur. There are also
those who have dedicated their time and effort to uncovering the real life
counterparts of the settings in which Arthurian legends take place. In
particular, it has been widely hypothesised that Avalon could in actuality be
Glastonbury or Isle of Man, though the_lack_of_substantial_evidence_points
Avalon_to_be_a_myth_derived_from_early_Celtic_tales.
The story of King Arthur dives into romance and chivalry. Historian Michael
Woods suggests that King Arthur‚Äôs times was a ‚Äúgolden_age_of_lost_innocence‚Äù,
hence forging a strong connection with people who long for a sense of dignity
and justice that seem to only exist in myth. The diverse interpretations of
Arthurian legends also bring to light different aspects of the tale, such as
the contrasting_portrayals_of_Morgan_le_Fay and how it possesses links to
misogyny and the storyteller‚Äôs perspectives.¬† What do you think of when it
comes to Arthurian legends? Is it the memorable characters, the beautiful
settings or the weighty symbolism? Do you have any theories of when King Arthur
will rise again? Arthurian legends can mean many things to many different
people. They evolve according to its audience and their expectations as well as
understanding of the stories. Even so, it is evident that Arthurian legends
remain compelling in the minds of the people. As_the_BBC_reports, ‚ÄúRomantics
may hope that, one day, Arthur will return to rescue his people. But if he
lives on through his legend, the ancient monarch, it would appear, has never
really gone away‚Äù.

**** Part 1- An Overview of Master Legend ****

Ladies and gentlemen, By the Gods airways would like you to buckle your safety
belts and make sure your seats are in an upright, locked position as we descend
into our all night tour of Fist City and it‚Äôs most famous resident‚Ä¶MASTER
LEGEND!

The article ‚ÄúThe_Legend_of_Master_Legend,‚Äù written by Joshuah Bearman and
appearing in the January 2009 edition of Rolling Stone was my (and many other
people‚Äôs) introduction to the concept of ‚Äúreal life superheroes.‚Äù Reading about
that fascinating idea led me to seeking out my local RLSH, the Watchman and
talking with him led me to forming the idea that I would like to write a book
on this subject.

After setting up a MySpace_page for the book, I shortly received two very
different e-mails. One was from someone telling me what a great, awesome guy
Master Legend was and that I should get in contact with him. A second e-mail
told me that Master Legend was a nutjob and they were sick of writers using him
as a representative of the RLSH community.

And so it has gone ever since. I have seen a large amount of debate online and
heard many people‚Äôs opinions on the phone and in person. Because of this amount
of controversy I have put off writing about the man here on my blog, but I feel
the time is now to have a thorough discussion about him. My goal is to provide
as fair of a representative of views supporting or criticizing him. In this
first part, I will be presenting an overview of ‚Äúpro‚Äù and ‚Äúanti‚Äù statements I
have seen repeatedly during my course of writing about RLSH.

PRO-LEGEND

-Tales of Comic Book Bravado and Crimefighting
Something that appeals to some RLSH about Master Legend is that he is very
dynamic and energetic. He is often documented running, jumping, and doing
things like hitting the wall of his garage with a giant metal fist. He makes
comic book exclamations like ‚ÄúBy the Gods!‚Äù He threatens to give evil doers ‚Äúan
all night tour of Fist City!‚Äù His stories are wild, action packed, and never a
snoozefest.

Some of them are fantastic and we must take them at Master Legend‚Äôs word, since
the only witnesses are Master Legend himself and the claimed league of
frightened criminals who have had the misfortune of crossing paths with him.
Here‚Äôs a recent blog post:
     There has been an evil doer in my town and you know I won't allow it.
     This guy known as Big Red has been terrorizing my homeless friends
     but now it's time to meet the Legend.

     This guy has tried to evade me because he knows of the whispered
     tales behind shuttered doors of Master Legend. He has a few punks
     that do crack, friends, so I got Brimstone to come along for mission:
     attack. I knew where he would be and right on time. He has been
     running his mouth out in the streets saying he can kick Master
     Legend's ass. I tell you this, he will need more Cheerios then the
     universe has.

     So yesterday (fellow Team Justice member) Brimstone and I made a
     quick approach in the Justice Van. We caught him hassling my friends
     red handed, so I told him "so you want to kick my ass, here‚Äôs your
     chance!" I threw off my shirt and slipped on my fighting gloves and
     said," alright boy you can run your mouth but can you run your fist!"

     Sorry to say the big lug ran for it. He got on his bike and zoomed
     away faster than I ever saw him go before- ha ha ha. It just goes to
     show you my friends that the bully is really a sissy inside. It is up
     to us all to stand against evil and destroy it. I know if we all work
     together we can.
     -‚ÄúMaster Legend Wards Off Dangerous Criminal,‚Äù June 28, 2010, MySpace
     blog


It‚Äôs a good story, I see why people would like it. An evildoer is threatening
the homeless, Master Legend shows up and scares him off, then parts with some
good advice. If Big Red was hassling my homeless friends, I‚Äôd load up the
Justice Van with Brimstone and go threaten to kick his ass, too. Big Red, if
you‚Äôre reading this- Fist City.
Master Legend‚Äôs energy and his war stories are contagious and has won him RLSH
and non-RLSH fans alike.

-Work with Team Justice
Something that has been well documented are the things he does with Team
Justice, which made RLSH history by becoming the first RLSH non-profit group.
Along with his fellow team members Superhero, Lady Hero, Symbiote, Ace Diamond,
Brimstone, and others, he has delivered food and supplies to Florida‚Äôs large
homeless population. He very sensibly has handed out socks to the homeless.
That may seem like a very minor thing, but if you are homeless in a climate
like Florida‚Äôs clean socks aren‚Äôt just a matter of being more comfortable- they
can literally be a life saver, preventing fatal disease. He has participated in
Christmas time toy drives, charity events, and helped distribute flyers of
missing children.
These missions are well documented with photos and video which you can see at
www.teamjusticeinc.webs.com

-Acting as a Media Ambassador
Besides the Rolling Stone article mentioned, Master Legend has attracted media
attention from around the world and for many documentarians, flying to Florida
is at the top of the list. I know for a fact he has been visited by two
documentary film makers in the last two months and receives a steady stream of
visiting journalists, authors, documentary film makers, and photographers. I
have heard rumors that he has had interest from HBO about developing a show of
some kind and strangely has even had talks about his own cooking show! Some
RLSH say this media attention is not just good for Master Legend, but good for
RLSH in general.
Not only that, but Master Legend runs his own RLSH forum, leading a platoon at
the Master_Legend_Army and recently began his own internet radio entry- The
Master_Legend_Show.

-Can Shred on Guitar
One of America‚Äôs great exports (besides comic book superheroes) is rock n roll,
and Master Legend likes to shred on the guitar as evidenced by video showing
him performing with the band Alias Punch, as well as his own musical projects.
Master Legend tells me his favorite guitar players are Randy California(Spirit,
also played with Jimmy Hendrix), Eric Lifeson (Rush),and Jeff Beck (The
Yardbirds).

It stands to follow that Americans like superheroes, and they like rock n roll,
so a rock n roll superhero who fights crime and can do a guitar solo is going
to impress a certain amount of people.

-Recognition From Local Law Enforcement
In "The Legend of Master Legend," Joshuah Bearman reports that he got in touch
with a local police Sergeant, who spoke favorably of Master Legend.
     (The) Sergeant, who‚Äôs in charge of vice investigations, took a chance
     and tracked Master Legend down. Based on the neighborhood, he
     figured, Master Legend might be a good local contact. ‚ÄúAnd sure
     enough,‚Äù the Sergeant tells me, ‚ÄúI start getting calls from Master
     Legend with information. And it checks out. Master Legend has helped
     put away a few criminals.‚Äù
     --‚ÄúThe Legend of Master Legend,‚Äù by Joshuah Bearman, Rolling Stone,
     Jan. 2009

Additionally, a photo on MySpace shows Master Legend receiving a certificate of
recognition from a police officer.

ALSO ADDED: RLSHs tell me that Master Legend helped Florida residents in the
aftermath of Hurricane Charly- "He helped cut apart trees on roads so relief
trucks and traffic can get through. He was also pulling people out of their
houses who were trapped."


ANTI-LEGEND
-Tales of Comic Book Bravado and Crimefighting
The very thing that appeals to some people about Master Legend is what others
use as a criticism- his storytelling. Many of his claims have no documentation
and are outlandish.
For example, in his article Joshuah Bearman writes about how Master legend and
Justice Force (a pre-Team Justice) had a mission to ‚Äúput the stomp on a child
molester and his gang of crackheads.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúMaster Legend has many more florid tales of adventure, some
     plausible, like retrieving a friend‚Äôs stolen money, others quite
     outlandish, like the child molester and his gang of crackheads. (For
     starters, doesn‚Äôt it seem like you‚Äôd have to be one charismatic child
     molester to attract an entire gang of crackheads to do your
     bidding?)‚Äù
     -‚ÄúThe Legend of Master Legend,‚Äù by Joshuah Bearman, Rolling Stone,
     Jan. 2009


In another blog entry, Master Legend himself describes a confrontation he has
in an alleyway with three criminals he encounters while give a homeless man
blankets. After engaging them in combat he writes about how he wins the back
alley brawl:
     I then see the first guy back at me so I throw a drop kick on him. I
     then take off my helmet and bash him in the head with it, by this
     time they hear the Legend yell as I go into Fist City mode. The one
     guy‚Äôs head is bleeding and (he) staggers off as the other two are
     back on me. I still use my helmet as my weapon. Then one whips out a
     knife so I quickly reach into my utility belt and grab a habanero
     pepper. I quickly chew it up while backing off then I snap kick the
     first one that charged. The guy with the knife slashes at me and I
     spit the pepper in his eyes. He hits the ground screaming I turn
     around and laid out about 20 punches on the other guy. Then ran back
     over to the guy with the knife and stomped it out his hand and even
     sprained my foot kicking him into the brick wall. ‚Äì
     - ‚ÄúFist City in the Scummy Alleyway,‚Äù Jan. 12, 2009, MySpace blog


He goes on to say that he flees the scene when someone comes across it and says
they are calling the cops. Master Legend says ‚Äúcall them‚Äù and gives the person
his card before heading to a pizza joint and ordering pizza and beer. The
police show up there and basically tell him to keep up the good work.

So Master Legend triumphs over three armed street hoods using his WWII helmet
and habanero pepper he has tucked in his utility belt. Do I have evidence this
story is false? No, I don‚Äôt. But I will say if I tried to file this story as
factual, I can tell you my editors most likely would:
1. Check the calendar to see if it was April 1.
2.Tell me to get out of their office, possibly permanently.

-Claims of Metaphysical and Religious Powers
Master Legend has claimed to have various metaphysical and voodoo based powers.
From the "about me" section of his MySpace:
     I am a real life super hero born with a purple veil and certain
     psychic abilities and gifted with powers by a voodoo queen. I am here
     to help you and will put my life on the line to do so. Never hesitate
     to ask for my advice or for me to use my powers to help you.- MySpace

In January 2010, Master Legend posted a message that he was the archangel
Metatron. It first appeared at the Heroes Network, which led to him being
banned from that forum. Here is the post in question:
     ‚ÄúI, the arch angel Metatron, am taking prayer requests. Do not be
     afraid and let me cast away demons and ailments in your life. God has
     told me I can do this at this time, so come to me with your troubles
     and I will help and it doesn't matter who you are.‚Äù
     -January 2010


-Anti-Homosexual Comments
Master Legend has received some controversy from statements he‚Äôs made regarding
homosexuals. For instance, on March 4, 2010 Atavistik, a RLSH from Northern
California posted a thread titled "RLSHSF- Meet at Pride Festival" at
therlsh.net. He suggested that RLSHs in Northern California meet up for San
Francisco's Gay Pride Fest.
Master Legend responded to the thread:
     ‚ÄúDo you not see this is like a gateway drug to even worst (sic)
     immorality? I tell you this because I care and I can rest easy
     knowing I tried to warn you. I don't care if people want to hate me
     for being a man of the bible but the bible is not all my reason. Can
     you not see the sickness that leads to death? This is just horrible.
     You want to praise disgust and evil and call it freedom? What‚Äôs next,
     child molester pride day? Hey, it's freedom so that gives me the
     freedom to say the truth. I don't feel sorry for them or praise this.
     I also have the freedom to destroy this evil. I cannot believe that
     this is not seen.‚Äù
     -March 4, 2010


-Allegations of Alcohol Abuse
By this, I‚Äôm not talking about the fact the Master Legend drinks in the comfort
of Legend Tower. Many people of all professions drink- police officers,
doctors, ditch diggers- even RLSH bloggers.
The allegations I am talking about are Master Legend drinking and then going on
patrol or driving the Justice Van. I want to be very clear- I have no evidence
that will back such an allegation up and will give full benefit of the doubt
that these allegations are false until I see proof otherwise.
The reason it has made this list is that I have heard these allegations not
once, but several times.

***** WELCOME TO HEROES IN THE NIGHT! *****
My name is Tea Krulos and I'm a freelance writer from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. I
was introduced to the Real Life Super Hero(RLSH) story in late February, 2009.
As a lifelong fan of comic books and unusual and unique people and subcultures,
I was immediately hooked.
I was determined to find a local RLSH if there was one and found The Watchman,
a man who dons a red rubber mask, suit, and trenchcoat and patrols the streets
of Milwaukee. I had a long, fascinating interview with him in person one night
and determined that the short magazine piece I had successfully pitched did not
scratch the surface of the story and decided to write a book. After a few
months I also established this blog- both the book and the blog are titled
Heroes in the Night.
My book is based on extensive research, interviewing, and field work. I have
traveled to meet RLSH in Minneapolis, Rochester (Minnesota), Brooklyn,
Vancouver, Portland, Seattle, San Diego, New Bedford (Massachusetts) , and
Washington DC, as well as meeting regularly with the Milwaukee crew.
I have been quoted as an expert on the subject in the New York Times, Wall
Street Journal, People magazine, Seattle Weekly, Scientific American, io9.com,
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, and dozens of other newspapers, magazines, websites
around the world. I've also made appearances on a dozen radio shows and have
been filmed for three different RLSH documentaries.
I have written articles on the subject for Milwaukee magazine, the Boston
Phoenix, New York Press, Forces of Geek, Riverwest Currents, and Delayed

Legend is a 2015 biographical drama_film written and directed by Brian
Helgeland, adapted from John_Pearson's book The_Profession_of_Violence:_The
Rise_and_Fall_of_the_Kray_Twins.[6][7] The film follows the Kray_twins' career
and relationship together through their life imprisonment in 1969.[8][9]
Tom_Hardy, Emily_Browning, David_Thewlis and Christopher_Eccleston star with
Colin_Morgan, Chazz_Palminteri, Paul_Bettany, Tara_Fitzgerald, Taron_Egerton,
and the singer Duffy in supporting roles.
***** Plot *****
[edit]
In the 1960s, Reggie Kray is a former boxer who has become an important part of
the criminal underground in London. At the start of the film, his twin brother
Ron is locked up in a psychiatric hospital for paranoid_schizophrenia. Reggie
uses threats to obtain the premature release of his brother. The twins unite
their efforts to control a large part of London's criminal underworld, made
easier when the head of the south London Richardson_Gang (a.k.a. the Torture
Gang) is imprisoned. One of their first efforts is to muscle in on the control
of a local nightclub, using extortion and brutal violence.
Reg enters into a relationship with Frances, his driver's sister, whom he
eventually marries. When he is imprisoned for a previous criminal conviction,
which he cannot evade, she makes him swear that he will leave his criminal life
behind, an oath he never honours owing to the allure of crime. While Reg is in
prison, Ron's mental instability and violent temperament lead to severe
financial setbacks at the nightclub, and it is almost forced to close after Ron
scares away most of the customers. On the first night after Reg's release from
prison, the brothers have an all-out fist fight, but they manage to patch
things up, at least partially.
The brothers are approached by Angelo_Bruno of the Philadelphia_crime_family
who, on behalf of Meyer_Lansky and the American_Mafia, wants to engage them in
a crime-syndicate deal. Bruno agrees to a fifty-fifty deal with Reg to split
London's underground gambling profits in exchange for local protection by the
brothers. Initially, this system is highly lucrative for the Kray brothers;
however, Ron's paranoia and inclination towards violence causes problems for
Reg's efforts to maintain control. Ron's barely concealed volatility results in
him publicly murdering George Cornell, an associate of the Torture Gang. As a
result, Scotland_Yard opens a full investigation of the Kray brothers.
Reg's marriage with Frances crumbles owing to his addiction to crime. Unable to
bear Reg's false promises to reform, Frances starts consuming prescription
drugs illegally. After he beats and rapes her in a fit of rage, she leaves him.
When Reg approaches her to reconcile, Frances seems to agree and they plan to
visit Ibiza, but she kills herself with a drug overdose, leaving Reg ridden
with guilt. The twins' criminal activities continue, and Ron pays petty
criminal Jack_"the_Hat"_McVitie to kill Leslie Payne, Reg's partner, who
controls the legal side of the Krays' operations, as he does not trust Payne.
Jack only wounds Payne, who then turns the brothers over to Detective
Superintendent Leonard_"Nipper"_Read, the head of the investigation. Reg finds
out and brutally stabs McVitie with a knife during a party hosted by Ron. The
testimony given by Payne means that Ron is arrested and charged with Cornell's
murder. The final scene shows a police squad breaking down the door to Reggie's
flat in order to apprehend him for McVitie's murder.
The closing captions indicate both brothers receiving criminal convictions for
murder. They died five years apart, Ron from a heart attack in 1995, and Reggie
from bladder cancer in 2000.

***** Production *****
[edit]
**** Development ****
[edit]
On 12 October 2013, it was announced that Brian_Helgeland had written a script
and would be directing a film focusing on the life of Reggie Kray who, with
identical brother Ronald, formed the notorious Kray_twins. Helgeland said the
film would concentrate on Reggie's attempts to control the psychopathic
tendencies of his younger twin.
Helgeland spoke of hanging out in London with well-known Krays associate
Freddie_Foreman, saying, "I had drinks with him in his local haunt. When we
finished he got up to go and they feted him at the bar. I said to him, 'what
about the bill?' and he replied, 'we don't pay.'"[10]
Helgeland attended the Cannes_Film_Festival with Working_Title's Tim_Bevan and
Chris Clark to talk to potential buyers of the film and showing test footage of
Hardy playing the twins.[11][12]
**** Casting ****
[edit]
On 18 April 2014, it was announced that Helgeland would write and direct the
film, with the shooting being based in the United Kingdom and with Hardy
starring as the male leads.[13] Five days later, it was stated that Browning
was in negotiations for a role as the film's female lead.[14] Hardy was so set
on playing Ronnie Kray that he proposed to Helgeland that if he gave him the
role of Ronnie, Hardy would play the role of Reggie for free.
**** Filming ****
[edit]
Crews and cast were spotted filming scenes at Falmouth Road, London, St_Anne's
Limehouse in Limehouse[15] and in the Windmill Walk area around London
Waterloo.[16] Filming also took place in Caradoc Street in Greenwich, in the
Cedra Estate on Cazenove Road and in Gibson_Gardens, both of which are in
Hackney.
Principal_photography started on 12 June 2014.[11][17]
***** Release *****
[edit]
Financing for Legend was provided by StudioCanal, which also distributed in the
United Kingdom, France, New_Zealand and Germany in addition to handling
international sales, which started at the beginning of the Cannes Film
Festival.[18] On 30 April 2014, Cross_Creek_Pictures acquired the North
American distribution rights to Legend from StudioCanal, with a planned 2015
theatrical release through Universal_Pictures in its distribution deal with the
studio.[19][20] Sales to other territories such as Asia, Africa and much of
Europe are being completed.[21] The film was originally set for release in the
US on 2 October 2015, but it was moved to 20 November 2015.[22]
Legend premiered at the Toronto_International_Film_Festival on 12 September
2015 at Roy_Thomson_Hall.[citation_needed]
**** Marketing ****
[edit]
On 13 June 2014, the first image of the film was published, featuring Hardy as
the Kray twins.[6][23] A promotional poster attracted publicity because it made
a two-star review from The_Guardian appear to be at least a four-star review by
placing the two stars between the heads of the Krays.[24][25]
**** Home media ****
[edit]
Legend was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on 25 January 2016
and in the United States on 1 March 2016.[26]
***** Reception *****
[edit]
**** Critical reception ****
[edit]
On the review_aggregator website Rotten_Tomatoes, 60% of 171 critics' reviews
are positive, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's consensus reads:
"As a gangster biopic, Legend is deeply flawed, but as a showcase for Tom
Hardy‚Äîin a dual role, no less‚Äîit just about lives up to its title."[27]
Metacritic, which uses a weighted_average, assigned the film a score of 55 out
of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "mixed or average" reviews.[28]
**** Box office ****
[edit]
Legend grossed US$28.0¬†million in the United Kingdom, and marked seven weeks in
the Top 10 at the British box office.[29] In addition, it grossed $1.9¬†million
in the United States and Canada, and $13.1¬†million in other territories, for a
worldwide total of $43.0¬†million,[29] against a budget shy of $25¬†million.[30]

Urban legends (sometimes modern legend, urban myth, or simply legend) is a
genre of folklore concerning stories about an unusual (usually scary) or
humorous event that many people believe to be true but largely are not.[1]
These legends can be entertaining but often concern mysterious peril or
troubling events, such as disappearances and strange objects or entities. Urban
legends may confirm moral standards, reflect prejudices, or be a way to make
sense of societal anxieties.[2]
In the past, urban legends were most often circulated orally, at gatherings and
around the campfire for instance. Now, they can be spread by any media,
including newspapers, mobile news apps, e-mail, and most often, social_media.
Some urban legends have passed through the years/decades with only minor
changes, in where the time period takes place. Generic urban legends are often
altered to suit regional variations, but the lesson or moral generally remains
the same.
***** Origin and structure *****
[edit]
The term "urban legend", as used by folklorists, has appeared in print since at
least 1968, when it was used by Richard_Dorson.[3] Jan_Harold_Brunvand,
professor of English at the University_of_Utah, introduced the term to the
general public in a series of popular books published beginning in 1981.
Brunvand used his collection of legends, The_Vanishing_Hitchhiker:_American
Urban_Legends_&_Their_Meanings (1981) to make two points: first, that legends
and folklore do not occur exclusively in so-called primitive or traditional
societies, and second, that one could learn much about urban and modern culture
by studying such tales.[4]
Many urban legends are framed as complete stories with plot and characters. The
compelling appeal of a typical urban legend is its elements of mystery, horror,
fear, or humor. Often they serve as cautionary_tales.[5] Some urban legends are
morality_tales that depict someone acting in a disagreeable manner, only to
wind up in trouble, hurt, or dead.[6]
Urban legends will often try to invoke a feeling of disgust in the reader which
tends to make these stories more memorable and potent. Elements of shock_value
can be found in almost every form of urban legend and are partially what makes
these tales so impactful.[7] An urban legend may include elements of the
supernatural or paranormal.[8]
***** Propagation and belief *****
[edit]
As Jan Brunvand points out,[9] antecedent legends including some of the motifs,
themes and symbolism of the urtexts can readily be identified. Cases that may
have been at least partially inspired by real events include "The Death Car"
(traced by Richard_Dorson to Michigan, United_States);[9] "the Solid Cement
Cadillac"[10] and the possible origin of "The_Hook" in the 1946 series of
Lovers'_Lane murders in Texarkana,_Texas, United States.[11][12] The urban
legend that Coca-Cola developed the drink Fanta to sell in Nazi_Germany without
public backlash originated as the actual tale of German Max_Keith, who invented
the drink and ran Coca-Cola's operations in Germany during World_War_II.[13]

Arrow).
The narrator of an urban legend may claim it happened to a friend (or to a
friend_of_a_friend), which serves to personalize, authenticate and enhance the
power of the narrative[14] while distancing the teller from the tall_tale. Many
urban legends depict horrific crimes, contaminated foods, or other situations
that would potentially affect many people. Anyone believing such stories might
feel compelled to warn loved ones. On occasion, news organizations, school
officials and even police departments have issued warnings concerning the
latest threat.[15] According to the "Lights Out" rumor, street_gang members
would drive without headlights until a compassionate motorist responded with
the traditional flashing of headlights, whereupon a prospective new gang member
would have to murder the citizen as a requirement of initiation.[16] A fax
retelling this legend received at the Nassau_County,_Florida, fire department
was forwarded to police, and from there to all city departments. The Minister
of_Defence_for_Canada was taken in by it also; he forwarded an urgent security
warning to all Ontario Members of Parliament.[16]
Urban legends typically include common elements: the tale is retold on behalf
of the original witness or participant; dire warnings are often given for those
who might not heed the advice or lesson contained therein (a typical element of
many e-mail phishing scams); and the tale is often touted as "something a
friend told me", the friend being identified by first name only or not
identified at all.[17] Such legends seem to be believable and even provocative,
as some readers are led in turn to pass them on, including on social media
platforms that instantly reach millions worldwide.[18] Many are essentially
extended jokes, told as if they were true events.[19]
Persistent urban legends do often maintain a degree of plausibility, as in the
story a serial_killer deliberately hiding in the back seat of a car. Another
such example since the 1970s has been the recurring rumor that the Procter_&
Gamble Company was associated with Satan-worshippers because of details within
its 19th-century "57" trademark.[20] The legend interrupted the company's
business to the point that it stopped using the trademark.[21]
***** Relation to mythology *****
[edit]
The earliest term by which these narratives were known, "urban belief tales",
highlights what was then thought of as a key property: their tellers regarded
the stories as true accounts, and the device of the FOAF (acronym for "Friend
of a Friend" invented by English writer and folklorist Rodney_Dale in 1976) was
a spurious but significant effort at authentication.[22] The coinage leads in
turn to the terms "FOAFlore" and "FOAFtale". While at least one classic legend,
the "Death Car", has been shown to have some basis in fact,[23] folklorists
have an interest in debunking those narratives only to the degree that
establishing non-factuality warrants the assumption that there must be some
other reason why the tales are told, re-told and believed.[24] As in the case
of myth, the narratives are believed because they construct and reinforce the
worldview of the group within which they are told, or "because they provide us
with coherent and convincing explanations of complex events".[25]
Social_scientists have started to draw on urban legends in order to help
explain complex socio-psychological beliefs, such as attitudes to crime,
childcare, fast food, SUVs and other "family" choices.[26] The authors make an
explicit connection between urban legends and popular folklore, such as Grimm's
Fairy_Tales, where similar themes and motifs arise. For that reason, it is
characteristic of groups within which a given narrative circulates to
vehemently reject claims or demonstrations of non-factuality; an example would
be the expressions of outrage by police officers who are told that adulteration
of Halloween treats by strangers (the subject of periodic moral_panics) occurs
extremely rarely, if at all.[24][27]
***** Documentation *****
[edit]
The Internet has made it easier both to spread and to debunk urban legends.[28]
[29] For instance, the Usenet newsgroup alt.folklore.urban and several other
websites, most notably snopes.com, focus on discussing, tracking, and analyzing
urban legends. The United_States_Department_of_Energy had a now-discontinued
service called Hoaxbusters[30] that dealt with computer-distributed hoaxes and
legends.[31] The most notable such hoaxes are known as creepypastas, which are
typically horror stories written anonymously. Although most are regarded as
obviously false, some, such as the Slender_Man, have gained a following_of
people_that_do_believe_in_them.[32]
Television shows such as Urban_Legends, Beyond_Belief:_Fact_or_Fiction, and
later Mostly_True_Stories:_Urban_Legends_Revealed, feature re-enactments of
urban legends, detailing the accounts of the tales and (typically later in an
episode) revealing any factual basis they may have. The Discovery_Channel TV
show MythBusters (2003‚Äì2016) tried to prove or disprove several urban legends
by attempting to reproduce them using the scientific_method. [33]
The 1998 film Urban_Legend featured students discussing popular urban legends
while at the same time falling victim to killings re-enacting them.[34] The
1999 film The_Blair_Witch_Project purposefully positioned itself as an urban
legend to gain viral hype and succeeded in fooling many that it was based on a
real disappearance.[35] The lack of widespread social media and search engines
helped it proliferate in the months leading up to its release.[36]
Between 1992 and 1998 The_Guardian newspaper "Weekend" section published the
illustrated "Urban Myths" column by Phil Healey and Rick Glanvill, with content
taken from a series of four books: Urban Myths, The Return of Urban Myths,
Urban Myths Unplugged,[37] and Now! That's What I Call Urban Myths. The 1994
comics anthology the Big_Book_of_Urban_Legends, written by Robert Boyd, Jan
Harold_Brunvand, and Robert_Loren_Fleming, featured 200 urban legends,
displayed as comics.[citation_needed]
The British writer Tony_Barrell has explored urban legends in a long-running
column in The_Sunday_Times. These include the story that Orson_Welles began
work on a Batman movie in the 1940s, which was to feature James_Cagney as the
Riddler and Marlene_Dietrich as Catwoman;[38] the persistent rumour that the
rock singer Courtney_Love is the granddaughter of Marlon_Brando;[39] and the
idea that a famous_1970s_poster of Farrah_Fawcett contains a subliminal sexual
message concealed in the actress's hair.[40]
***** Genres *****
[edit]
**** Crime ****
[edit]
As with traditional urban legends, many internet rumors are about crimes or
crime waves ‚Äì either fictional or based on real events that have been largely
exaggerated.[41][42][43] Such stories can be problematic, both because they
purport to be relevant modern news and because they do not follow the typical
patterns of urban legends.[44]
**** Medicine ****
[edit]
Some legends are medical folklore, such as the claim that eating watermelon
seeds will result in a watermelon growing in the stomach, or that going
outdoors just after showering will result in catching a cold.[45] Many old
wives'_tales have grown around the identification of ailments, real and
imagined, and the recommended remedies, rituals, and home-grown medical
treatments to treat them.[citation_needed]
**** Internet ****
[edit]
Internet urban legends are those spread through the internet, as through Usenet
or email[46] or more recently through other social_media. They can also be
linked to viral online content. Some take the form of chain_letters and spread
by e-mail, directing the reader to share them or to meet a terrible fate,[47]
and following a recognizable outline of hook, threat, and finally request.[48]
**** Paranormal ****
[edit]
Paranormal urban-legend stories usually involve someone encountering something
supernatural, such as a cryptid[49]‚Äîfor instance, Bigfoot or Mothman,[50]
legendary creatures for which evidence is lacking but which have legions of
believers.[51] Research shows that people experiencing sudden or surprising
events (such as a Bigfoot sighting) may significantly overestimate the duration
of the event.[52]
**** Marketing ****
[edit]
Companies have been accused of hiding "secret messages" behind their logos or
packaging,[53] as in the case of the old Procter_&_Gamble symbol, supposedly an
occult figure that gave panache to the brand. (If the thirteen stars in the
symbol were connected a certain way, it would show three_sixes in a row or
looked at the 3 curls at the bottom they form the inverted 6s.)[54] Similarly,
a video of a Christian woman "exposing" Monster_Energy for using the Hebrew
letter vav ( ◊ï ), forming the letter "M", to disguise the number 666 went viral
on Facebook.[55]

****** Tom Hardy's once-derided Kray Twins film Legend is having its day in the
sun on Netflix ******
Guy Ritchie's 2015 biopic of the Kray twins, currently the most popular film on
Netflix UK, does little to zhuzh up the crime genre ‚Äî but it's elevated by one
(two!) of Hardy's best performances
By Jack_King

Legend, now sat at the top spot on Netflix in the UK, famously wedged a two-
star Guardian review between Tom_Hardy&#x27;s Kray twins on its promotional
poster, cheekily disguised as if the critic&#x27;s take was more favourable ‚Äî
with the two outer stars covered over. In ways, that sums up Guy Ritchie&#x27;s
gangster biopic: a showy, ostentatious, wannabe-prestige thing, clearly gunning
for bonafides with all the trappings of awards bait, but without the formal
ingenuity or pizzazz on the page to justify it. The saving grace? Hardy.
Hardy plays two roles in one, sharing similar screen time and indeed, through
some nifty effects work, often the same frame: both Ronnie and Reggie Kray, the
nefarious sibling clubland duo who swindled and savoured &#x27;60s London in
equal measure. They rubbed shoulders with the best and brightest in town, from
Julie Garland through to Frank_Sinatra, brutally extorting the local nightclubs
while cultivating a chic, suited and booted image with the city elites.
Legend isn&#x27;t a good movie. Structurally, it&#x27;s drab and conventional,
an elliptical chronology of Kray moments loosely knitted together by the
narration of Reggie&#x27;s beleaguered beau, Frances (Emily Browning).
It&#x27;s shot and designed with all the colour of an old, faded postage stamp,
functionally framed like a ‚Äò70s soap, demonstrating little in the way of
thought around visual language (for all of Ritchie‚Äôs pulpish strengths,
he&#x27;s never been great at placing a camera). So thank god for Hardy making
it watchable.
It&#x27;s a two-hander for the most part, the genius of that being that the
hands in play are both Hardy. But the Krays, despite their identical
appearance, were far from the same person: Reg was the calm-headed leader of
the pack, Ron more off-kilter and, as a paranoid schizophrenic, shown to be
liable to flashes of violence. Reg speaks with a roguish twang, appears more
chiselled and handsome, and certainly more approachable, a lad your nan might
invite in for tea and cake. Ronnie variously communicates through his nose or
with a bark, little between.
The contrast Hardy captures between the two men is quite astounding, their
smallest specificities ‚Äî the sort you&#x27;d learn over time, months of orbit,
to distinguish them ‚Äî brought to the surface. Playing two parts of the same
fraternity allows Hardy to showcase all of his emotional and physiological
range. Ron is carried with weightiness, his chins gluttonous and pouring over
like the gowls of a slobbering pitbull; Reg is commanding but light-stepped,
svelte and debonair. The first presents that he will get shit done, in an
escalate-to-deescalate fashion, whereas the latter actually does. It&#x27;s the
juxtaposition of power and control as projected by image.
Despite popular misconception, Hardy and the infamous Krays aren&#x27;t exactly
from the same neck of the woods. The 44-year-old is clear about this in
interviews, to be fair ‚Äî in a Wired video, he described himself as a
‚Äúbourgeois, posh, middle-class twat‚Äù ‚Äî but Legend isn&#x27;t simply a case of
Hardy falling back into the working class rhythms of his youth. A lot of this
is owed to roles like Bronson, Inception and Locke, where Hardy cultivated,
consciously or not, a rough n&#x27; rugged, loveable bad boy image ‚Äî Legend
being the arguable apex.
Seven years on, with Legend enjoying something of a resurgence vis-a-vis
Netflix, you&#x27;d better believe there&#x27;s only one reason people are
flocking to rewatch it. And his name ain&#x27;t Guy.
Legend is now streaming on Netflix UK.

Wrap Legend in Stacked Charts
 ‚Äé09-25-2020 02:49 AM
Hi,¬†
¬†
Is there any way to wrap the legend on a stacked chart? I need it at the bottom
center (left or right doesn't work so much for me).¬†
¬†
Thanks in advance!¬†

Here is one work with legend text getting cut off or when you have long legend
values:
1. Turn off legends on the various visuals you want to display
2. Create a Treemap visual with same data columns. Place its legend on "Top
Left ". Reduce height of the Tree Map visual so that only the Legend displays.
I set it to 60px and only the legend was showing. I set the width of the tree
map visual as wide as possible to accomodate long values in my Legend's data
category.
¬†
Hope this helps.

That's right, buddy @MFelix¬†. Though I am asking for something such as a legend
wrap since I have quite a few categories and can't go about expanding the graph
size. The other obvious way around it is placing the legend to the left or
right, though I need it at the bottom center.¬†
¬†
In Excel, for example, the legend can be fit in two/three parallel lines. Don't
see that happening here.¬†

Hi¬†@Anonymous
¬†,
¬†
There is no such option for legend wrap in Power BI now . I suggest you create
an idea for it in https://ideas.powerbi.com/forums/265200-power-bi-ideas to
improve the Power BI.¬†
¬†
As a workaround, you can create a custom legend by column chart. For detailed
steps, you can refer to the video:¬†https://community.powerbi.com/t5/forums/
replypage/board-id/power-bi-designer/message-id/592887
¬†
If this post¬†helps, then please consider¬†Accept it as the solution¬†to help the
other members find it more quickly.
¬†
Best Regards,
Dedmon Dai

Hi¬†@Anonymous
¬†,
¬†
There is no option on the legends for wraping values, one option can be to make
some sort of a table or matrix visualization and used it as your legend if you
group the two together the final user won't realize they are looking at
different visuals however this depends on the data.

****** matplotlib.legend# ******
The legend module defines the Legend class, which is responsible for drawing
legends associated with Axes and/or figures.
Important
It is unlikely that you would ever create a Legend instance manually. Most
users would normally create a legend via the legend function. For more details
on legends there is also a legend_guide.
The Legend class is a container of legend handles and legend texts.
The legend handler map specifies how to create legend handles from artists
(lines, patches, etc.) in the Axes or figures. Default legend handlers are
defined in the legend_handler module. While not all artist types are covered by
the default legend handlers, custom legend handlers can be defined to support
arbitrary objects.
See the :ref`<legend_guide>` for more information.
  classmatplotlib.legend.DraggableLegend(legend, use_blit=False, update='loc')
  [source]#
      Bases: DraggableOffsetBox
      Wrapper around a Legend to support mouse dragging.
        Parameters:
              legendLegend
                  The Legend instance to wrap.
              use_blitbool, optional
                  Use blitting for faster image composition. For details see
                  FuncAnimation.
              update{'loc', 'bbox'}, optional
                  If "loc", update the loc parameter of the legend upon
                  finalizing. If "bbox", update the bbox_to_anchor parameter.

      Bases: Artist
      Place a legend on the figure/axes.
        Parameters:
              parentAxes or Figure
                  The artist that contains the legend.
              handleslist of (Artist or tuple of Artist)
                  A list of Artists (lines, patches) to be added to the legend.
              labelslist of str
                  A list of labels to show next to the artists. The length of
                  handles and labels should be the same. If they are not, they
                  are truncated to the length of the shorter list.
        Attributes:
              legend_handles
                  List of Artist objects added as legend entries.
                  Added in version 3.7.
        Other Parameters:
              locstr or pair of floats, default: rcParams["legend.loc"]
              (default: 'best') for Axes, 'upper right' for Figure
                  The location of the legend.
                  The strings 'upper left', 'upper right', 'lower left', 'lower
                  right' place the legend at the corresponding corner of the
                  axes/figure.
                  The strings 'upper center', 'lower center', 'center left',
                  'center right' place the legend at the center of the
                  corresponding edge of the axes/figure.
                  The string 'center' places the legend at the center of the
                  axes/figure.
                  The string 'best' places the legend at the location, among
                  the nine locations defined so far, with the minimum overlap
                  with other drawn artists. This option can be quite slow for
                  plots with large amounts of data; your plotting speed may
                  benefit from providing a specific location.
                  The location can also be a 2-tuple giving the coordinates of
                  the lower-left corner of the legend in axes/figure
                  coordinates (in which case bbox_to_anchor will be ignored).
                  For back-compatibility, 'center right' (but no other
                  location) can also be spelled 'right', and each "string"
                  location can also be given as a numeric value:
                  Location String    Location Code
                  'best' (Axes only) 0
                  'upper right'      1
                  'upper left'       2
                  'lower left'       3
                  'lower right'      4
                  'right'            5
                  'center left'      6
                  'center right'     7
                  'lower center'     8
                  'upper center'     9
                  'center'           10
                  If a figure is using the constrained layout manager, the
                  string codes of the loc keyword argument can get better
                  layout behaviour using the prefix 'outside'. There is
                  ambiguity at the corners, so 'outside upper right' will make
                  space for the legend above the rest of the axes in the
                  layout, and 'outside right upper' will make space on the
                  right side of the layout. In addition to the values of loc
                  listed above, we have 'outside right upper', 'outside right
                  lower', 'outside left upper', and 'outside left lower'. See
                  Legend_guide for more details.
              bbox_to_anchorBboxBase, 2-tuple, or 4-tuple of floats
                  Box that is used to position the legend in conjunction with
                  loc. Defaults to axes.bbox (if called as a method to
                  Axes.legend) or figure.bbox (if figure.legend). This argument
                  allows arbitrary placement of the legend.
                  Bbox coordinates are interpreted in the coordinate system
                  given by bbox_transform, with the default transform Axes or
                  Figure coordinates, depending on which legend is called.
                  If a 4-tuple or BboxBase is given, then it specifies the bbox
                  (x, y, width, height) that the legend is placed in. To put
                  the legend in the best location in the bottom right quadrant
                  of the Axes (or figure):
                  loc='best', bbox_to_anchor=(0.5, 0., 0.5, 0.5)
                  A 2-tuple (x, y) places the corner of the legend specified by
                  loc at x, y. For example, to put the legend's upper right-
                  hand corner in the center of the Axes (or figure) the
                  following keywords can be used:
                  loc='upper right', bbox_to_anchor=(0.5, 0.5)
              ncolsint, default: 1
                  The number of columns that the legend has.
                  For backward compatibility, the spelling ncol is also
                  supported but it is discouraged. If both are given, ncols
                  takes precedence.
              propNone or FontProperties or dict
                  The font properties of the legend. If None (default), the
                  current matplotlib.rcParams will be used.
              fontsizeint or {'xx-small', 'x-small', 'small', 'medium',
              'large', 'x-large', 'xx-large'}
                  The font size of the legend. If the value is numeric the size
                  will be the absolute font size in points. String values are
                  relative to the current default font size. This argument is
                  only used if prop is not specified.
              labelcolorstr or list, default: rcParams["legend.labelcolor"]
              (default: 'None')
                  The color of the text in the legend. Either a valid color
                  string (for example, 'red'), or a list of color strings. The
                  labelcolor can also be made to match the color of the line or
                  marker using 'linecolor', 'markerfacecolor' (or 'mfc'), or
                  'markeredgecolor' (or 'mec').
                  Labelcolor can be set globally using rcParams
                  ["legend.labelcolor"] (default: 'None'). If None, use
                  rcParams["text.color"] (default: 'black').
              numpointsint, default: rcParams["legend.numpoints"] (default: 1)
                  The number of marker points in the legend when creating a
                  legend entry for a Line2D (line).
              scatterpointsint, default: rcParams["legend.scatterpoints"]
              (default: 1)
                  The number of marker points in the legend when creating a
                  legend entry for a PathCollection (scatter plot).
              scatteryoffsetsiterable of floats, default: [0.375, 0.5, 0.3125]
                  The vertical offset (relative to the font size) for the
                  markers created for a scatter plot legend entry. 0.0 is at
                  the base the legend text, and 1.0 is at the top. To draw all
                  markers at the same height, set to [0.5].
              markerscalefloat, default: rcParams["legend.markerscale"]
              (default: 1.0)
                  The relative size of legend markers compared to the
                  originally drawn ones.
              markerfirstbool, default: True
                  If True, legend marker is placed to the left of the legend
                  label. If False, legend marker is placed to the right of the
                  legend label.
              reversebool, default: False
                  If True, the legend labels are displayed in reverse order
                  from the input. If False, the legend labels are displayed in
                  the same order as the input.
                  Added in version 3.7.
              frameonbool, default: rcParams["legend.frameon"] (default: True)
                  Whether the legend should be drawn on a patch (frame).
              fancyboxbool, default: rcParams["legend.fancybox"] (default:
              True)

              (default: False)
                  Whether to draw a shadow behind the legend. The shadow can be
                  configured using Patch keywords. Customization via rcParams
                  ["legend.shadow"] (default: False) is currently not
                  supported.
              framealphafloat, default: rcParams["legend.framealpha"] (default:
              0.8)
                  The alpha transparency of the legend's background. If shadow
                  is activated and framealpha is None, the default value is
                  ignored.
              facecolor"inherit" or color, default: rcParams
              ["legend.facecolor"] (default: 'inherit')
                  The legend's background color. If "inherit", use rcParams
                  ["axes.facecolor"] (default: 'white').
              edgecolor"inherit" or color, default: rcParams
              ["legend.edgecolor"] (default: '0.8')
                  The legend's background patch edge color. If "inherit", use

                  If mode is set to "expand" the legend will be horizontally
                  expanded to fill the Axes area (or bbox_to_anchor if defines
                  the legend's size).
              bbox_transformNone or Transform
                  The transform for the bounding box (bbox_to_anchor). For a
                  value of None (default) the Axes' transAxes transform will be
                  used.
              titlestr or None
                  The legend's title. Default is no title (None).
              title_fontpropertiesNone or FontProperties or dict
                  The font properties of the legend's title. If None (default),
                  the title_fontsize argument will be used if present; if
                  title_fontsize is also None, the current rcParams
                  ["legend.title_fontsize"] (default: None) will be used.
              title_fontsizeint or {'xx-small', 'x-small', 'small', 'medium',
              'large', 'x-large', 'xx-large'}, default: rcParams
              ["legend.title_fontsize"] (default: None)
                  The font size of the legend's title. Note: This cannot be
                  combined with title_fontproperties. If you want to set the
                  fontsize alongside other font properties, use the size
                  parameter in title_fontproperties.
              alignment{'center', 'left', 'right'}, default: 'center'
                  The alignment of the legend title and the box of entries. The
                  entries are aligned as a single block, so that markers always
                  lined up.

                  The custom dictionary mapping instances or types to a legend
                  handler. This handler_map updates the default handler map
                  found at matplotlib.legend.Legend.get_legend_handler_map.
              draggablebool, default: False
                  Whether the legend can be dragged with the mouse.
        codes= {'best': 0, 'center': 10, 'center left': 6, 'center right': 7,
        'lower center': 8, 'lower left': 3, 'lower right': 4, 'right': 5,

        contains(mouseevent)[source]#
            Test whether the artist contains the mouse event.
              Parameters:
                    mouseeventMouseEvent
              Returns:
                    containsbool
                        Whether any values are within the radius.

                        An artist-specific dictionary of details of the event
                        context, such as which points are contained in the pick
                        radius. See the individual Artist subclasses for
                        details.
        draw(renderer)[source]#
            Draw the Artist (and its children) using the given renderer.
            This has no effect if the artist is not visible (Artist.get_visible
            returns False).
              Parameters:
                    rendererRendererBase subclass.
            Notes
            This method is overridden in the Artist subclasses.
        draw_frame(b)[source]#
            Set whether the legend box patch is drawn.
              Parameters:
                    bbool
        get_alignment()[source]#
            Get the alignment value of the legend box
        get_bbox_to_anchor()[source]#
            Return the bbox that the legend will be anchored to.
        get_children()[source]#
            Return a list of the child Artists of this Artist.
        classmethodget_default_handler_map()[source]#
            Return the global default handler map, shared by all legends.
        get_draggable()[source]#
            Return True if the legend is draggable, False otherwise.
        get_frame()[source]#
            Return the Rectangle used to frame the legend.
        get_frame_on()[source]#
            Get whether the legend box patch is drawn.
        staticget_legend_handler(legend_handler_map, orig_handle)[source]#
            Return a legend handler from legend_handler_map that corresponds to
            orig_handler.
            legend_handler_map should be a dictionary object (that is returned
            by the get_legend_handler_map method).
            It first checks if the orig_handle itself is a key in the
            legend_handler_map and return the associated value. Otherwise, it
            checks for each of the classes in its method-resolution-order. If
            no matching key is found, it returns None.
        get_legend_handler_map()[source]#
            Return this legend instance's handler map.
        get_lines()[source]#
            Return the list of Line2Ds in the legend.
        get_patches()[source]#
            Return the list of Patchs in the legend.
        get_texts()[source]#
            Return the list of Texts in the legend.
        get_tightbbox(renderer=None)[source]#
            Like Artist.get_window_extent, but includes any clipping.
              Parameters:
                    rendererRendererBase subclass, optional
                        renderer that will be used to draw the figures (i.e.
                        fig.canvas.get_renderer())
              Returns:
                    Bbox or None
                        The enclosing bounding box (in figure pixel
                        coordinates). Returns None if clipping results in no
                        intersection.
        get_title()[source]#
            Return the Text instance for the legend title.
        get_window_extent(renderer=None)[source]#
            Get the artist's bounding box in display space.
            The bounding box' width and height are nonnegative.
            Subclasses should override for inclusion in the bounding box
            "tight" calculation. Default is to return an empty bounding box at
            0, 0.
            Be careful when using this function, the results will not update if
            the artist window extent of the artist changes. The extent can
            change due to any changes in the transform stack, such as changing
            the Axes limits, the figure size, or the canvas used (as is done
            when saving a figure). This can lead to unexpected behavior where
            interactive figures will look fine on the screen, but will save
            incorrectly.

        set_alignment(alignment)[source]#
            Set the alignment of the legend title and the box of entries.
            The entries are aligned as a single block, so that markers always
            lined up.
              Parameters:
                    alignment{'center', 'left', 'right'}.
        set_bbox_to_anchor(bbox, transform=None)[source]#
            Set the bbox that the legend will be anchored to.
              Parameters:
                    bboxBboxBase or tuple
                        The bounding box can be specified in the following
                        ways:
                            * A BboxBase instance
                            * A tuple of (left, bottom, width, height) in the
                              given transform (normalized axes coordinate if
                              None)
                            * A tuple of (left, bottom) where the width and
                              height will be assumed to be zero.
                            * None, to remove the bbox anchoring, and use the
                              parent bbox.
                    transformTransform, optional
                        A transform to apply to the bounding box. If not
                        specified, this will use a transform to the bounding
                        box of the parent.
        classmethodset_default_handler_map(handler_map)[source]#
            Set the global default handler map, shared by all legends.

              Parameters:
                    statebool
                        Whether mouse dragging is enabled.
                    use_blitbool, optional
                        Use blitting for faster image composition. For details
                        see FuncAnimation.
                    update{'loc', 'bbox'}, optional
                        The legend parameter to be changed when dragged:
                            * 'loc': update the loc parameter of the legend
                            * 'bbox': update the bbox_to_anchor parameter of
                              the legend
              Returns:
                    DraggableLegend or None
                        If state is True this returns the DraggableLegend
                        helper instance. Otherwise this returns None.
        set_frame_on(b)[source]#
            Set whether the legend box patch is drawn.
              Parameters:
                    bbool
        set_loc(loc=None)[source]#
            Set the location of the legend.
            Added in version 3.8.
              Parameters:
                    locstr or pair of floats, default: rcParams["legend.loc"]
                    (default: 'best') for Axes, 'upper right' for Figure
                        The location of the legend.
                        The strings 'upper left', 'upper right', 'lower left',
                        'lower right' place the legend at the corresponding
                        corner of the axes/figure.
                        The strings 'upper center', 'lower center', 'center
                        left', 'center right' place the legend at the center of
                        the corresponding edge of the axes/figure.
                        The string 'center' places the legend at the center of
                        the axes/figure.
                        The string 'best' places the legend at the location,
                        among the nine locations defined so far, with the
                        minimum overlap with other drawn artists. This option
                        can be quite slow for plots with large amounts of data;
                        your plotting speed may benefit from providing a
                        specific location.
                        The location can also be a 2-tuple giving the
                        coordinates of the lower-left corner of the legend in
                        axes/figure coordinates (in which case bbox_to_anchor
                        will be ignored).
                        For back-compatibility, 'center right' (but no other
                        location) can also be spelled 'right', and each
                        "string" location can also be given as a numeric value:
                        Location String    Location Code
                        'best' (Axes only) 0
                        'upper right'      1
                        'upper left'       2
                        'lower left'       3
                        'lower right'      4
                        'right'            5
                        'center left'      6
                        'center right'     7
                        'lower center'     8
                        'upper center'     9
                        'center'           10
                        If a figure is using the constrained layout manager,
                        the string codes of the loc keyword argument can get
                        better layout behaviour using the prefix 'outside'.
                        There is ambiguity at the corners, so 'outside upper
                        right' will make space for the legend above the rest of
                        the axes in the layout, and 'outside right upper' will
                        make space on the right side of the layout. In addition
                        to the values of loc listed above, we have 'outside
                        right upper', 'outside right lower', 'outside left
                        upper', and 'outside left lower'. See Legend_guide for
                        more details.
        set_ncols(ncols)[source]#
            Set the number of columns.
        set_title(title, prop=None)[source]#
            Set legend title and title style.
              Parameters:

                        The legend title.
                    propfont_manager.FontProperties or str or pathlib.Path
                        The font properties of the legend title. If a str, it
                        is interpreted as a fontconfig pattern parsed by
                        FontProperties. If a pathlib.Path, it is interpreted as

***** # Legend Item Interface *****
Items passed to the legend onClick function are the ones returned from
labels.generateLabels. These items must implement the following interface.

    text: string,
    // Border radius of the legend item.
    // Introduced in 3.1.0
    borderRadius?: number | BorderRadius,
    // Index of the associated dataset
    datasetIndex: number,
    // Fill style of the legend box
    fillStyle: Color,
    // Text color
    fontColor: Color,
    // If true, this item represents a hidden dataset. Label will be rendered
with a strike-through effect
    hidden: boolean,
    // For box border. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/

CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineDashOffset
    lineDashOffset: number,
    // For box border. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/
CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineJoin
    lineJoin: string,
    // Width of box border
    lineWidth: number,

    strokeStyle: Color,
    // Point style of the legend box (only used if usePointStyle is true)
    pointStyle: string | Image | HTMLCanvasElement,
    // Rotation of the point in degrees (only used if usePointStyle is true)
    rotation: number
}
***** # Example *****
The following example will create a chart with the legend enabled and turn all
the text red in color.
const chart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'bar',
    data: data,
    options: {
        plugins: {
            legend: {
                display: true,
                labels: {
                    color: 'rgb(255, 99, 132)'
                }
            }
        }
    }
});
***** # Custom On Click Actions *****
It can be common to want to trigger different behaviour when clicking an item
in the legend. This can be easily achieved using a callback in the config
object.
The default legend click handler is:
function(e, legendItem, legend) {
    const index = legendItem.datasetIndex;
    const ci = legend.chart;
    if (ci.isDatasetVisible(index)) {
        ci.hide(index);
        legendItem.hidden = true;
    } else {
        ci.show(index);
        legendItem.hidden = false;
    }
}
Let's say we wanted instead to link the display of the first two datasets. We
could change the click handler accordingly.
const defaultLegendClickHandler = Chart.defaults.plugins.legend.onClick;
const pieDoughnutLegendClickHandler =
Chart.controllers.doughnut.overrides.plugins.legend.onClick;
const newLegendClickHandler = function (e, legendItem, legend) {
    const index = legendItem.datasetIndex;
    const type = legend.chart.config.type;
    if (index > 1) {
        // Do the original logic
        if (type === 'pie' || type === 'doughnut') {
            pieDoughnutLegendClickHandler(e, legendItem, legend)
        } else {
            defaultLegendClickHandler(e, legendItem, legend);
        }
    } else {
        let ci = legend.chart;
        [
            ci.getDatasetMeta(0),
            ci.getDatasetMeta(1)
        ].forEach(function(meta) {
            meta.hidden = meta.hidden === null ? !ci.data.datasets
[index].hidden : null;
        });
        ci.update();
    }
};
const chart = new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: data,
    options: {
        plugins: {
            legend: {
                onClick: newLegendClickHandler
            }
        }
    }
});
Now when you click the legend in this chart, the visibility of the first two
datasets will be linked together.

***** Reviews *****
‚ÄúPlays out on one of the greatest, most beautiful maps in strategy gaming
history. It combines style, substance, and setting into a marvelous overall
experience for both empire management and tactical combat.‚Äù
8.3/10 ‚Äì IGN

‚ÄúBEST STRATEGY GAME 2014 - Reinvents the 4X genre, mirroring what XCOM did for
tactical turn-based games, and they have, as today Endless Legend brings the
genre to new heights.‚Äù
9/10 ‚Äì Hooked_Gamers

‚ÄúCOMMENDATION FOR DESIGN 2014 - At every stage Endless Legend shines. Where it
takes from the past, it puts its own spin on it. Where it innovates, it does so
cautiously and mostly successfully. Amplitude Studios has created another
astounding story-driven game, that really has taken the best bits of RTS, RPG
and 4X. This is a game that wannabe developers should play and learn from.‚Äù

***** About This Game *****
***** Create your own Legend *****
Another sunrise, another day of toil. Food must be grown, industries built,
science and magic advanced, and wealth collected. Urgency drives these simple
efforts, however, for your planet holds a history of unexplained apocalypse,
and the winter you just survived was the worst on record. A fact that has also
been true for the previous five.


As you discover the lost secrets of your world and the mysteries of the legends
and ruins that exist as much in reality as in rumor, you will come to see that
you are not alone. Other peoples also struggle to survive, to grow, and perhaps
even to conquer.

You have a city, a loyal populace, and a few troops; your power and magic
should be sufficient to keep them alive. But beyond that, nothing is certain‚Ä¶
Where will you go, what will you find, and how will you react? Will your trail
be one of roses, or of blood?

Plot[]
In the 1960s, Reggie_Kray is a former boxer who has become an important part of
the criminal underground in London. At the start of the film, his twin brother
Ron is locked up in a psychiatric hospital for insanity and paranoid
schizophrenia. Reggie uses threats to obtain the premature release of his
brother, who is rapidly discharged from hospital. The two brothers unite their
efforts to control a large part of London's criminal underworld. One of their
first efforts is to muscle-in on the control of a local night club, using
extortion and brutal violence.
Reggie enters into a relationship with Frances, the sister of his driver, and
they ultimately marry; however, he is imprisoned for a previous criminal
conviction, which he cannot evade. While Reggie is in prison, Ron's mental
problems and violence lead to severe setbacks at the nightclub. The club is
almost forced to close after Ron scares away most of the customers. When Reggie
is finally released from prison, the two brothers have an all-out fist fight on
the first night after Reggie's release, but they manage to partially patch
things up.
The brothers are approached by¬†Angelo Bruno¬†of the¬†Philadelphia crime family¬†on
behalf of¬†Meyer Lansky¬†and the¬†American Mafia, to try to interest them in a
crime syndicate deal. Bruno agrees to a fifty-fifty deal with Reggie to split
London's underground gambling profits in exchange for local protection from the
Kray brothers. Initially, this system is highly lucrative for the Kray
brothers. However, the results of Ron's barely concealed violence continue to
cause problems with¬†Scotland Yard, who open a full investigation of the Kray
brothers.
Reggie beats and rapes Frances and she leaves him. Reggie then approaches her
to start afresh offering her a holiday to¬†Ibiza. However, she is soon found
dead after committing suicide with an overdose of prescription drugs. The
brothers' criminal activities continue, and they are unable to thwart the
escalating Scotland Yard investigation by Detective Superintendent Leonard
"Nipper" Read, who soon arrests Ron. The final scene shows a police squad
breaking down the door to Reggie's flat in order to apprehend him.
 [Krayslegend]
Tom Hardy as both Ronnie and Reggie.

The closing captions indicate both brothers receiving criminal convictions for
murder. They died five years apart, Ron from a heart attack in 1995, and Reggie
from cancer in 2000.
Historical Inaccuracies[]
    * Albert_Donoghue is already working for the Firm at the start of the film
      when Ron is in the mental hospital. However, in real life, Albert started
      working for them a few years after Ron's release.
    * The real life events which are depicted in the film happened throughout
      several years (from the late 1950s or early 1960s until 1968). However,
      none of the characters age or start to appear older as the film goes on.
    * John_Dickson and Pat_Connolly do not have Scottish accents in the film,
      despite both in real life hailing from Scotland.
    * In the scene where Ron meets Frances for the first time, he tells her
      that he is homosexual. However, in real life, Ron claimed he was
      bisexual.
    * Charlie_Richardson's arrest in July 1966 is shown onscreen before George
      Cornell's_death, though this could be considered a flash-forward.
    * The film has a scene where George_Cornell calls Ron a "fat poof" in a
      confrontation with the twins in E._Pellicci, but in real life, Ron
      claimed Cornell "never called [Ron] a poof in his life, because if he had
      done, [Ron] would have killed him then and there."
    * In real life, Ron claimed to have shot George Cornell because he
      threatened to kill him, as this made Ron decide to kill him first. In the
      film, however, Ron shoots Cornell for ¬£2,000 from a dock worker who was
      beaten up by Cornell.
    * In real life, Ron claimed George Cornell did not say anything to him when
      he walked into The Blind Beggar and shot him. Also, the song 'The_Sun
      Ain't_Gonna_Shine_Anymore' was said to have been playing in the pub at
      the time of the shooting, but in the film, no music can be heard.
    * In the film, Reggie and Frances's eight-month marriage falls apart when
      he beats her up and rapes her. In real life, Frances insisted Reg was
      never physically violent towards her. Several friends of theirs have
      corroborated this.¬†Helgeland has since said he used this scene as part of
      his "poetic licence."
    * The escape and murder of Frank_Mitchell are not mentioned or depicted in
      the movie. This happened in December 1966, whereas the movie jumps from
      Reggie and Frances' relationship ending, occurring in 1966, to them both
      getting tickets to go to Ibiza in order to "make amends", occurring
      shortly before Frances' death in June 1967.
    * Allegedly, during the morning after Frances' death, her brother Frank
      left a cup of tea for her in her room before he left go to work, unaware
      that she was dead. However, in the film, he is seen to have realised she
      was dead after entering her room.
    * Billy_Exley drove Jack McVitie to Payne's house to kill him, but in the
      film, Jack appears to be alone. Payne also did not answer the door, nor
      did McVitie shoot him at all.
    * The murder of Jack McVitie happens differently in the film. Reggie
      suddenly decides to shoot Jack after he told Reg that it was "not [his]
      fault Frances killed herself" instead of already intending to do so due
      to him failing to kill Leslie Payne. He was lured into the basement and
      it was not done within the party. Also, Albert_Donoghue and Teddy_Smith
      were not present at the murder.
    * In real life, the Firm continued to operate for another seven months
      after, whereas the film seems to depict the arrest on 8 May 1968,
      happening the morning after McVitie's murder.
    * Ronnie only occasionally wore glasses, not all the time as depicted in
      the film. Also, in the film, Ronnie's eyes are a blueish-gray colour
      instead of brown.
    * Throughout the film, there is no mention of Charlie_Kray, the twins older
      brother, who was part of the Firm, and also a key influence on their
      lives, being present at and/or involved with many of the real-life events
      seen in the film.

identical brother Ronald, formed the notorious¬†Kray twins. Helgeland said the
film would concentrate on Reggie's attempts to control the psychopathic
tendencies of his younger twin.
Helgeland spoke of hanging out in London with well-known Krays
associate¬†Freddie_Foreman, saying, "I had drinks with him in his local haunt.
When we finished he got up to go and they feted him at the bar. I said to him,
'what about the bill?' and he replied, 'we don't pay." Helgeland attended
the¬†Cannes Film Festival¬†with¬†Working Title's¬†Tim Bevan¬†and Chris Clark to talk
to potential buyers of the film and showing test footage of Hardy playing the
twins.
Casting[]
On 18 April 2014, it was announced that Helgeland would write and direct the
film, with the shooting being based in the United Kingdom and with Hardy
starring as the male leads.¬†Five days later it was stated that Browning was in
negotiations for a role as the film's female lead.

Is there a minimum vertical spacing between items in ggplot2 legend?
I am trying to reduce the space between legend keys. This code seems to suggest
there is an absolute minimum (i.e. 0.001 pt).
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, col = as.factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(legend.key.spacing.y = unit(0.001, "pt"))

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, col = as.factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(legend.key.spacing.y = unit(10, "pt"))

      Could you clarify what's the issue? Also be aware that legend.spacing.y
      sets the spacing between legends, whereas legend.**key**.spacing.y sets
      the spacing between the keys or items.

      Yes, I get the difference between legend.spacing.y and
      legend.key.spacing.y. The publisher wants less space between the key
      items.

    * The negative point thing worked like a charm. But jesus, It would be nice
      for that to be described somewhere.

You can use legend.key.height within theme():
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, col = as.factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(legend.key.height = unit(0.001, 'mm')
        )

Lady_Godiva_%28John_Collier%2C_c._1897%29.jpg]In this 1897 painting of Lady
Godiva by John_Collier, the authentic historical person is fully submerged in
the legend, presented in an anachronistic high_medieval setting.
A legend is a genre of folklore that consists of a narrative featuring human
actions, believed or perceived to have taken place in human history. Narratives
in this genre may demonstrate human values, and possess certain qualities that
give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants,
may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time to keep them fresh
and vital.
Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely
believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted.[1]
Legends are sometimes distinguished from myths in that they concern human
beings as the main characters and do not necessarily have supernatural origins,
and sometimes in that they have some sort of historical basis whereas myths
generally do not.[2][3] The Brothers_Grimm defined legend as "folktale
historically grounded".[4] A by-product of the "concern with human beings" is
the long list_of_legendary_creatures, leaving no "resolute doubt" that legends
are "historically grounded."
A modern folklorist's professional definition of legend was proposed by Timothy
R. Tangherlini in 1990:[5]
     Legend, typically, is a short (mono-) episodic, traditional, highly
     ecotypified[6] historicized narrative performed in a conversational
     mode, reflecting on a psychological level a symbolic representation
     of folk belief and collective experiences and serving as a
     reaffirmation of commonly held values of the group to whose tradition
     it belongs.
***** Etymology and origin *****
[edit]

Holger_danske.jpg]Holger_Danske, a legendary character
Legend is a loanword from Old_French that entered English usage c.‚Äâ1340. The
Old French noun legende derives from the Medieval_Latin legenda.[7] In its
early English-language usage, the word indicated a narrative of an event. The
word legendary was originally a noun (introduced in the 1510s) meaning a
collection or corpus of legends.[8][9] This word changed to legendry, and
legendary became the adjectival form.[8]
By 1613, English-speaking Protestants began to use the word when they wished to
imply that an event (especially the story of any saint not acknowledged in John
Foxe's Actes_and_Monuments) was fictitious. Thus, legend gained its modern
connotations of "undocumented" and "spurious", which distinguish it from the
meaning of chronicle.[10]
In 1866, Jacob_Grimm described the fairy_tale as "poetic, legend historic."[11]
Early scholars such as Karl_Wehrhan¬†[de][12] Friedrich_Ranke[13] and Will_Erich
Peuckert[14] followed Grimm's example in focussing solely on the literary
narrative, an approach that was enriched particularly after the 1960s,[15] by
addressing questions of performance and the anthropological and psychological
insights provided in considering legends' social context. Questions of
categorising legends, in hopes of compiling a content-based series of
categories on the line of the Aarne‚ÄìThompson folktale index, provoked a search
for a broader new synthesis. In an early attempt at defining some basic
questions operative in examining folk tales, Friedrich_Ranke¬†[de] in 1925[16]
characterised the folk legend as "a popular narrative with an objectively
untrue imaginary content", a dismissive position that was subsequently largely
abandoned.[17]
Compared to the highly structured folktale, legend is comparatively amorphous,
Helmut_de_Boor noted in 1928.[18] The narrative content of legend is in
realistic mode, rather than the wry irony of folktale;[19] Wilhelm Heiske[20]
remarked on the similarity of motifs in legend and folktale and concluded that,
in spite of its realistic mode, legend is not more historical than folktale.
In Einleitung in der Geschichtswissenschaft (1928), Ernst_Bernheim asserted
that a legend is simply a longstanding rumour.[21] Gordon_Allport credited the
staying-power of some rumours to the persistent cultural state-of-mind that
they embody and capsulise;[22] thus "Urban_legends" are a feature of rumour.
[23] When Willian Hugh Jansen suggested that legends that disappear quickly
were "short-term legends" and the persistent ones be termed "long-term
legends", the distinction between legend and rumour was effectively
obliterated, Tangherlini concluded.[24]
***** Christian legenda *****
[edit]
Main article: Legendary_(hagiography)
In a narrow Christian sense, legenda ("things to be read [on a certain day, in
church]") were hagiographical accounts, often collected in a legendary. Because
saints' lives are often included in many miracle stories, legend, in a wider
sense, came to refer to any story that is set in a historical context, but that
contains supernatural, divine or fantastic elements.[25]
***** Oral tradition *****
[edit]
Main article: Oral_tradition
History_preserved_orally through many generations often takes on a more
narrative-based or mythological form over time,[26] an example being the oral
traditions_of_the_African_Great_Lakes.

Brabant connected her to Treves.
Hippolyte_Delehaye distinguished legend from myth: "The legend, on the other
hand, has, of necessity, some historical or topographical connection. It refers
imaginary events to some real personage, or it localizes romantic stories in
some definite spot."[27]
From the moment a legend is retold as fiction, its authentic legendary
qualities begin to fade and recede: in The_Legend_of_Sleepy_Hollow, Washington
Irving transformed a local Hudson River Valley legend into a literary anecdote
with "Gothic"_overtones, which actually tended to diminish its character as
genuine legend.[28]
Stories that exceed the boundaries of "realism" are called "fables". For
example, the talking_animal formula of Aesop identifies his brief stories as
fables and not legends. The parable of the Prodigal_Son would be a legend if it
were told as having actually happened to a specific son of a historical father.
If it included a donkey that gave sage advice to the Prodigal Son it would be a
fable.[citation_needed]
Legend may be transmitted orally, passed on person-to-person, or, in the
original sense, through written text. Jacobus_de_Voragine's Legenda Aurea or
"The Golden Legend" comprises a series of vitae or instructive biographical
narratives, tied to the liturgical_calendar of the Roman_Catholic_Church. They
are presented as lives of the saints, but the profusion of miraculous
happenings and above all their uncritical context are characteristics of
hagiography. The Legenda was intended to inspire extemporized homilies and
sermons appropriate to the saint of the day.[29]

Urban legends are a modern genre of folklore that is rooted in local popular
culture, usually comprising fictional stories that are often presented as true,
with macabre or humorous elements. These legends can be used for entertainment
purposes, as well as semi-serious explanations for seemingly-mysterious events,
such as disappearances and strange objects.
The term "urban legend," as generally used by folklorists, has appeared in
print since at least 1968.[30] Jan_Harold_Brunvand, professor of English at the
University_of_Utah, introduced the term to the general public in a series of
popular books published beginning in 1981. Brunvand used his collection of
legends, The_Vanishing_Hitchhiker:_American_Urban_Legends_&_Their_Meanings
(1981) to make two points: first, that legends and folklore do not occur
exclusively in so-called primitive or traditional societies, and second, that
one could learn much about urban and modern culture by studying such tales.

      popular oral tradition, usually consisting of an exaggerated or
      unreliable account of some actually or possibly historical person‚Äîoften a
      saint, monarch, or popular hero. Legends are sometimes distinguished from
      myths in that they concern human beings rather than gods, and sometimes
      in that they have some sort of historical basis whereas myths do not; but
      these distinctions are difficult to maintain consistently. The term was
      originally applied to accounts of saints' lives..

      theology and ritual. Their main characters are not usually human beings,
      but they often have human attributes; they are animals, deities, or
      culture heroes, whose actions are set in an earlier world, when the earth
      was different from what it is today, or in another world such as the sky
      or underworld....Legends are more often secular than sacred, and their
      principal characters are human. They tell of migrations, wars and
      victories, deeds of past heroes, chiefs, and kings, and succession in
      ruling dynasties.

****** The impact of urban legends ******

‚ÄúBloody Mary‚Äù repeated three times in the mirror, the tall, faceless man who
lurks in the dark, the story of a man waking up with a missing kidney ‚Äî urban
legends have always been whispered to us. From a young age, we have been told
stories about black-eyed children, the mysterious call received by a babysitter
and hundreds of other stories that make our skin crawl. Urban legends surround
us, and they can be anything from tales told on the school bus to internet
stories. But why do stories like this spread, and why do they impact us so
much?
The term ‚Äúurban legend‚Äù has been popular since the 1980s, when Jan Harold
Brunvand published his collection of urban legends and their meanings. When
discussing the story of the vanishing hitchhiker, Harold wrote that the legend
had evolved from older European stories about travelers riding horseback. With
time, the story adopted more variations. With changes in the narrative, scenery
and characters, the story has traveled far and wide, spreading by word of mouth
to ears all around.¬†
Urban legends typically grow popular through storytelling. The speaker usually
claims that such things happened to ‚Äúa friend of a friend,‚Äù making the story
something we want to believe. Because why would a friend lie? The peculiarities
and suspense of an urban legend are what makes them spread. The more shocking
yet realistic the story, the more we want to share it. Sometimes, urban legends
are told to extend caution and sometimes, most times, they are simply good
stories. Nowadays, instant communication has made it easier for urban legends
to spread. For a long time, urban legend email chains were popular, and now
such tales are told on social media with a few clicks. The continuous pattern
of misinformation circulating on social media has made it easier for such
stories to be shared, as many people take what they read and hear on the
internet at face value, never second-guessing their feeds.¬†
What makes urban legends so captivating is that they contain elements from
everyday life, such as walking through the woods, driving down a long road,
looking into a mirror ‚Äî the list is endless. There is something so haunting
about the possibility that ordinary things could expose us to the terrors these
legends speak of. As time passes, urban legends shift, retelling a modernized
version of the story to newer audiences, making urban legends everlasting.¬†
Some stories we take more seriously than others because apart from
entertainment, urban legends allow us to spread awareness and preach caution
about the dangers hidden in everyday life. But there have been times when urban
legends have been taken too seriously.¬†
In 2014, two girls attempted to brutally murder their best friend because of
the urban legend of the Slender Man. The first time the name touched screens
was in 2009, when two faked photos and ominous captions were posted about the
Slender Man, suggesting that because of this evil character, people had gone
missing. These two simple posts sparked an internet phenomenon, birthing lore,
video games, movies and more about the mysterious creature.¬†
People began to believe the Slender Man was real and that he was a danger to
society, specifically children. In 2013, when the story reached 12-year-olds
Anissa Weier and Morgan Geyser, it forever changed many lives. After believing
that the Slender Man was going to harm her family, Geyser proposed to Weier
that to become servants or proxies to Slender Man, they would have to sacrifice
their close friend. After plotting, the two young girls lured their 12-year-old
friend, Payton Leutner into the woods and stabbed her 19 times. Although the
girls were caught and Leutner survived, the story is not any less terrifying.¬†
It is important to be cautious when spreading stories, especially among
children. Because urban legends like this one can quickly unfold into more
elaborate, creative stories, our minds can wander into dark, scary places.
Although most are not susceptible to becoming violent because of a story, urban
legends can trigger deep, dark fears, impacting us deeply and oftentimes making
us paranoid.¬†
Most people have been impacted by urban legends in one way or another, whether
that be hearing a story and sharing it with a friend or stumbling upon a
Creepypasta and not being able to sleep in the dark for days. Urban legends are
not typical scary stories; they are spread with the notion that they are true
and that they are something we should beware of. Urban legends must be spread
with warning, as they can unravel more than we know.¬†
Urban legends can form innocently, sometimes with the simple intention of
amusing friends and sometimes with the intention of evoking harmless fear. But
as humans, we have a knack for taking scary stories and legends too seriously.
Do not believe everything you hear, and remember to spread stories with
caution. You never know what you could be stirring up in someone‚Äôs mind or how
easy it can be to impact a person‚Äôs life forever.¬†

***** Urban Legend (1998) *****
***** ¬† *****
***** Directed by Jamie Blanks *****
***** IMDB_link *****
***** ‚ÄãUrban Legend was a teen horror movie set at the fictional Pendleton
University where a rash of murders are being committed 25 years after the
campus was the site of a massacre. The bizarre murders all resemble different
urban legends. *****
***** ¬† *****
***** Warning: Page includes plot spoilers. *****
***** Filming on the Lakeshore Grounds *****
[Urban Legend-5-G as Stanley Hall.png]
[Urban Legend-15-Phone at G entrance 2.pn]
***** Humber College's G Building was the site of Stanley Hall, the supposed
site of a blood massacre in 1973, and Cumberland House serves as the fraternity
house. *****
***** ‚Äã *****
***** When the film was in production in 1997, G Building had yet to be
renovated (it was the last of the fomer Lakeshore Psychaitric Hospital
buildings leased by¬† Humber College to be renovated; it re-opened in 2016). The
derelict building provided the perfect setting for the site of the boarded-up,
abandoned Stanley Hall. Wooden slats were placed across each window and the
site was only visited at night, often in stromy weather, adding¬† to the
mystique of the location. *****
***** G Building *****
[Urban Legend-8-Arches of G 2.png]
[Urban Legend-24-Falling out G window 2.p]
***** Humber College's G Building was the site of Stanley Hall where a bloody
massacre took place 25 years prior. Early in the movie, Natalie (Alicia Witt)
and Brenda (Rebecca Gayheart) talk about the legend of the Stanley Hall
massacre and dare one another to stand in the doorway under the arch on the
east side of the building and repeat the words "Bloody Mary" three times. They
jump when they hear moaning coming up from the boarded-up door. *****
***** ‚Äã *****
***** Towards the end of the film Natalie (Alicia Witt) hears screaming coming
from Stanley Hall and climbs the south-eastern exterior of the building. She
and Paul (Jared Leto) then confront Brenda (Rebecca Gayheart), an argument
which results in Brenda falling out the second floor window over the archway of
G Building's east entrance. *****
***** ‚Äã *****
***** When the film was in production in 1997, G Building had yet to be
renovated (it was the last of the former Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital
buildings leased by¬† Humber College to be renovated; it re-opened in 2016). The
derelict building provided the perfect setting for the site of the boarded-up,
abandoned Stanley Hall. Wooden slats were placed across each window and the
site was only visited at night, often in stormy weather, adding¬† to the
mystique of the location. *****
***** Cumberland House *****
[Urban Legend-11-Cumberland Frat party.pn]
***** The former residence of the Superintendent of the Lakeshore Psychiatric
Hospital, today known as Cumberland House, served as the fraternity house in
Urban Legend where a Halloween party is held. ¬† *****
***** Fun Trivia *****
***** Urban Legend was released only two years after the first of the Scream
trilogy films and received much negative criticism when the two were compared.
Both films feature a well-known group of young actors playing a small group of
friends who are overly familiar with the horror movie genre and find themselves
at the center of a series of bizarre murders. Like its counterpart, Urban
Legend did not hesitate to poke fun at itself:

Just prior to his death, Damon (Joshua Jackson) turns on the radio in the car -
the song playing is the soundtrack to his hit TV show, Dawson's Creek (Paul
Cole's "I Don't Want to Wait').

At the end of the film a group of students sit around talking about the murders
and debate whether or not they are an urban legend. One of the students
jokingly says that they "bet Brenda was the girl from the Noxzema commercials"
- which Rebecca Gayheart starred in.

When Paul (Jared Leto) and Natalie (Alicia Witt) break into Professor Wexler's
(Robert Englund) office, they spot a Freddy Kruger puppet; Englund played
Kruger in A Nightmare on Elm Street. *****

    * The 27_Club is an urban legend that popular_musicians and other
      celebrated artists die at age 27 with statistically anomalous frequency,
      notably, Jimi_Hendrix, Janis_Joplin, Mia_Zapata, Jim_Morrison, Kurt
      Cobain, Jean-Michel_Basquiat, Kim_Jonghyun and Amy_Winehouse. The claim
      of a "statistical spike" for the death of musicians at that age has been
      repeatedly disproven by studies.[1]
    * The 999_phone_charging_myth is an urban legend which claims that calling
      an emergency_telephone_number, then promptly hanging up, charges mobile
      phone batteries.[2]
    * The 1962 Halloween massacre was an urban legend about a photo of a
      Halloween costume_party in 1962, in which seven people were purportedly
      killed.[3]
    * The 2016_clown_sightings were urban legends that rose in popularity
      during 2016 about an individual or group dressed up as clowns who stalk,
      harass, or otherwise scare random people.[4][5]

[edit]
    * Aerial_water_bomber_picking_up_scuba_diver is an urban legend about an
      aerial_water_bomber, or a helicopter with a dangling water bucket,
      scooping up a scuba diver and dumping them on a wildfire site. This
      legend was used as a plot_device in the films Magnolia and Barney's
      Version. The urban legend debunking site Snopes.com reports there are no
      proven cases of this happening in reality. The Discovery_Channel show
      MythBusters also disproved the myth.[6]
    * Anastasia_Romanov's_survival is a popular urban legend claiming that the
      Grand_Duchess_Anastasia_Nikolaevna_of_Russia survived after her family
      was_killed_in_1918. The legend originated from the fact that Anastasia's
      remains weren't buried with the corpses of her family. It remained a
      mystery for many years, until the truth was uncovered in 2007: Anastasia
      didn't survive, but was in fact buried in another place than her family.
    * Alexandria's Genesis is a purported genetic mutation that gives its
      carrier purple eyes, shimmering pale skin, a lack of body hair, and a
      lack of menstruation while still remaining fertile. The legend originated
      in a Daria fanfiction written in 1998, and since the 2000s has seen
      circulation on internet forums and social media.[7]
    * The Ankle slicing car thief (or the man under the car) is an urban legend
      that tells of a driver that keeps hearing noises under their car when
      they are driving. When they step out of the car to investigate, their
      ankles get sliced open with a knife. While they are rolling around on the
      ground in pain, a car thief emerges from underneath the car and steals
      it.[8]
    * Area_51 is another name for a portion of the Nevada_Test_and_Training
      Range that UFO enthusiasts have theorized contains evidence of visitors
      from outer space. There is disputed evidence for these claims.[9]
***** B *****
[edit]
    * Baby_Train is an urban legend which claims that a small town had an
      unusually high birth rate because a train would pass through the town at
      5:00 am and blow its whistle, waking up all the residents. Since it was
      too late to go back to sleep and too early to get up, couples would have
      sex. This resulted in the mini baby-boom.[10][11]
    * The_babysitter_and_the_man_upstairs (also known as the babysitter or the
      sitter) is an urban legend dating back to the 1960s about a teenage girl

      Bladenboro,_North_Carolina.
    * The Beast_of_Bodmin_Moor is a folklore legend that describes a phantom
      cat purported to live in Cornwall, England, United_Kingdom. Bodmin Moor
      became a centre of purported sightings after 1978, with occasional
      reports of mutilated slain livestock; the alleged panther/leopard-like
      black cats of the same region came to be popularly known as the Beast of
      Bodmin Moor.

      environment, and shapeshift, and was located in Robertson_County,
      Tennessee.

      panhandling, or are encountered on doorsteps of residential homes. Tales
      of black-eyed children have appeared in pop culture since the late 1990s.
    * Bloody_Mary is a folklore legend consisting of a ghost or spirit conjured
      to reveal the future. She is said to appear in a mirror when her name is

[18][19]
The Catman of Greenock is the urban legend since the 1970s of a man in

      purportedly led by an individual named "Mr. Azakov" in an unnamed place
      in Siberia, had drilled a hole that was 14.4 kilometres (8.9¬†mi) deep
      before breaking through to a cavity. Intrigued by this unexpected
      discovery, they lowered an extremely heat-tolerant microphone, along with
      other sensory equipment, into the well. The temperature deep within was
      1,000¬†¬∞C (1,832¬†¬∞F)¬†‚Äì heat from a chamber of fire from which

      publication coinciding with the 65th anniversary of the founding of the

      night at Pau, May 18, 1814, stopping on the route from Toulouse to
      Madrid. The tale of a more lengthy and marked presence developed 90 years
      later as a prank that regular winter colonists played on newcomers. The
      tale found its way into touristic marketing publications, memoires and
      academic publications during challenging times, and then, despite
      contradictory historical evidence, it has developed into Bearnese
      folklore. Worldwide, is difficult to find any 21st century historical
      passage about the 19th century "English" colony at Pau that does not cite
      some form of this legend as fact.

      "bear ape" or "sheepsquatch" of the Kanawha_River region of West

    * The Women in Black of Wat Samian Nari is the story of the ghosts of the
      beautiful Thipsuksri sisters, Chulee and Sulee, in black dresses. The
      sisters are believed to have been crushed by a train until their bodies
      were torn in two in front of Wat_Samian_Nari temple, Chatuchak, Bangkok
      in the 1990s. Their spirits haunt people at night, especially taxi
      drivers. Most often it is said that a taxi picks up two sisters in black
      from the entertainment district, Ratchadapisek_Road, or RCA past
      midnight. The sisters ask the driver to bring them to the Wat Samian Nari
      temple. Thinking they would go home after hanging out there, the driver
      notices that they sit quietly, not speaking to each other or even
      reciprocating with him. As the taxi approaches the destination, they
      mysteriously vanished from the back seat. The cab driver steps out of the
      car in a daze, suddenly seeing the two sisters lying on rail tracks in
      front of the temple, cut in half, and dragging their bloodied torsos in
      pain.[111]

****** What exactly is the difference between Mythology, Legend, Folklore,
Epics and other forms of literature?  ******

This question came to my mind as I was reading The Ravenous Hyenas and the
Wounded Sun: Myth and Ritual in Ancient India by Stephanie W. Jamison, where
she defined myth, for the purpose of her work, as a narrative that involves
divine or semidivine or beyond-human figures as major participants in the
story.
Is this accurate?
Can someone answer this specific query besides the more general one in the
title?

****** Fascinating Myths in Iceland ******
[Landmannalaugar in the Highlands of Iceland.]
****** A Comprehensive Guide to Icelandic Folklore & Legends ******
In a realm where fiery volcanoes clash with icy glaciers and the Northern
Lights illuminate the winter sky, Iceland is a place where the boundaries
between the natural and the supernatural blur. This remote island, forged by
the raw power of nature, is steeped in legends that echo with the whispers of
ancient gods, elusive elves, and fearsome trolls. Here, the winds carry
folktales of hidden worlds beneath the earth, where creatures of myths and
legend dwell. Join us as we delve into the mystical narratives at the heart of
this Nordic land.
¬†
***** Lagarflj√≥tsormur, the Icelandic Loch Ness monster¬† *****
Deep in the waters of Lake Lagarfljot in East_Iceland lies the beast,
Lagarflj√≥tsormur (the Lagarfljot worm), similar to Scotland‚Äôs Loch Ness
monster. Legend has it that a young girl once asked her mother how to make the
most of the gold ring she gave her. The mother told the daughter a myth,
according to which, gold can grow on a worm. So the young girl trapped a worm
alongside her gold ring in a chest. But alas, it was the worm that grew bigger
instead. Scared, she threw the chest into the lake making it the monster‚Äôs home
for eternity.
The legend stems from the eerie atmosphere around the lake. Of late, its
existence has been alluded to on the Internet through videos showing a moving
form in¬†Lake_Lagarfljot.¬†
¬†
***** The Trolls of V√≠k¬† *****
The rocky mountains of the Icelandic Highlands are home to big, stupid, and
greedy trolls - a prominent character in Icelandic folklore. Although not
physically appealing, trolls can perform extraordinary magical feats (including
fearsome spells and enchantments). As they aren‚Äôt the most clever beings humans
can easily free themselves of their enchantments. That being said, trolls have
a taste for flesh and often lure unsuspecting humans (including misbehaving
children) into their caves through spells, potions, or simply by capturing
them.
The Reynisdrangar cliffs, three towering rocks off the beach of Reynisfjara,
V√≠k √≠ M√Ωrdal, are a testament to the Icelandic legend of trolls turning to
stone in the sun.
[Hvitserkur or the troll rock in Iceland.]
***** The √Ålfh√≥l Dollhouses¬† *****
No matter where you find yourself in Iceland‚Äîwhether amidst the bustle of a
lively town or deep within the enchanting embrace of its otherworldly
landscapes‚Äîyou are likely to encounter √Ålfh√≥l. These miniature wooden
dwellings, lovingly crafted by human hands, stand as humble abodes for the
elves who are believed to inhabit them. √Ålfh√≥l dollhouses can range from the
simplest to the most elaborate and include minute churches, created to convert
the elves to Christianity.
¬†
***** Hulduf√≥lk, the Elves of Iceland¬† *****
North European and Germanic mythology refer to elves as beautiful subtle
eternal beings having extraordinary magical power. In Iceland, elves are called
Hulduf√≥lk (hidden people) as they live in enchanted rocks and cliffs. Their
resemblance to humans and their lifestyle is remarkably uncanny and believed to
be why they are invisible most of the time, except for occasions like Midsummer
Night and New_Year‚Äôs_Eve.
Icelandic elves are fiercely protective of their enchanted homes and are known
to unleash great harm on those who disturb them. The latest manifestation of
this myth occurred during a road-laying project at the G√°lgahraun lava field in
2015. Mysterious breakdowns and strange accidents plagued the project until, at
last, the road was rerouted to bypass the hidden people's realm, leaving their
secrets undisturbed.
¬†
***** Iceland‚Äôs Yule Lads¬† *****
In Iceland, the holiday season doesn‚Äôt start until Yule Lads, or rather the
first of these thirteen mischievous creatures have made their appearance. These
thirteen brothers, who trace their lineage back to trolls, inhabit the pitch-
black caves within the mountains, sharing their home with their ogre parents,
Gr√Ωla and Leppal√∫√∞i, and the child-eating Yule Cat. Their tradition of creating
mischief in rural communities led them to be called names such as ‚ÄòThe Door
Slammer‚Äô and ‚ÄòCandle Stealer‚Äô. Today these Yule Lads have taken on a new role
as the Icelandic version of Santa Claus.
Discover the fascinating¬†Christmas_traditions_of_Iceland on our previous blog.¬†
¬†
***** The Legend of Dimmuborgir *****
Around 2,300 years ago an eruption in the Lake_M√Ωvatn region of northern
Iceland created lava column sculptures at Dimmuborgir. Translated to ‚Äòdark
castle‚Äô in English, Dimmuborgir has been described as the gateway to Hell in
Nordic legends. Gr√Ωla and Leppal√∫√∞i, the troll parents of the Icelandic Yule
Lads are known to kidnap little children and bring them here during Christmas
time. The place also has references in pop culture, most notably, the Norwegian
dark metal band, Dimmu Borgir.

The lava from the eruption that created Dimmuborgir can also be seen in nearby
volcanic areas such as N√°maskar√∞_Pass, Grj√≥tagj√°_cave, and Krafla fissure.

As the mist settles over Iceland's rugged landscapes, the tales of ancient
beings, hidden worlds, and timeless magic linger in the air, leaving an
indelible mark on the soul. If you‚Äôre spurred by the desire to discover the
magic that dwells in this ancient land, book a stay at our Icelandic_hotels for
a comfortable stay during your mystical explorations!

mathematician and a legend of Hindu Mathematics and Astronomy; the physicists,
Dr D. B. Deodhar and Prof. Wali Mohammad; Dr G.S. Thapar and Prof. K. N. Bahl

ESPN's Top 100 Athletes: Simone Biles (1:05)

Open Extended Reactions
The greatest athlete of the 21st century? That's easy. It has to be Tom_Brady,
the quarterback of the greatest dynasty America's favorite sport has ever seen,
a seven-time Super Bowl champ and five-time Super Bowl MVP. Yep. Tom Brady.
Except. Except it has to be Lionel_Messi, the best player in the world's
favorite sport, an eight-time Ballon d'Or winner as the footballer of the year.
Yep, definitely Messi.
Except ... no ... LeBron_James, right? Four-time NBA champ, four-time Finals
MVP, four-time regular-season MVP, 20-time All-NBA, most points scored in NBA
history. No athlete has dominated the public conversation like LeBron has. He
has to be No. 1.
Except, what about Serena_Williams? Winner of 23 Grand Slam titles, the Serena
Slam (holding all four major titles at the same time) and four Olympic gold
medals. And she got her final Grand Slam event win while pregnant, putting her
career on hold while she was at her most dominant.
Except, if you are going to pick a tennis player, what about Roger_Federer? He
transformed an entire sport with his artistry, his chess game on the court, his
blazing forehand. He won 20 Grand Slam titles and became the most beloved
tennis player of all time. Gotta be Fed.
Yeah, except Rafael_Nadal won 22 Grand Slam titles and Novak_Djokovic has won
24. You have to pick one of them over Federer.
Hmm. Maybe this isn't so easy. We didn't even mention the Olympians: Usain Bolt
and Michael Phelps and Katie Ledecky and Simone Biles. Or Kobe. Gotta throw
Kobe Bryant into the discussion. Or Lewis_Hamilton. Or Peyton_Manning. Or Floyd
Mayweather. Or Tiger. Geez, almost forgot about Tiger_Woods.
Yes, ranking the top 100 most accomplished athletes since 2000 wasn't quite so
easy after all -- but it sure was fun. Twenty-five years ago, the ESPN
SportsCentury_project ranked the top 100 North American athletes of the 20th
century. Michael Jordan came in first, followed by Babe Ruth, Muhammad Ali, Jim
Brown and Wayne Gretzky. (Ruth should have been No. 1, but hey, I'm a baseball
writer.) We also ranked a horse: Secretariat came in at No. 35.

With so many transcendent athletes over the past 25 years, we thought it was
time to do another ranking. I promise you there are no horses this time (sorry,
American Pharoah). In considering the best athletes of the 21st century,
however, we have expanded our choices beyond North America. ESPN editions from
around the globe contributed to the nominations and voting process, as well as
the individual sport list rankings that will follow.
Voters were instructed to consider only an athlete's performance since 2000.
So, for Barry Bonds: He won seven MVP awards, but only four of those came after
2000, as did 317 of his 762 home runs. Or Ken Griffey Jr.: He played until
2010, but all of his best seasons came in the 1990s. Tiger won 13 of his 15
majors from 2000 on, so he's in good shape. Other athletes, such as Patrick
Mahomes or Nikola_Jokic or Shohei_Ohtani, obviously have more greatness ahead
of them, so we'll see how high their accomplishments so far get them on the
list.
In the end, we received more than 70,000 votes from ESPN contributors to create
our top 100.
Let the arguments begin. -- David Schoenfield, ESPN senior writer

***** 1. Michael Phelps, swimming *****
Key accomplishments: Record 28-time Olympic medalist, 23-time Olympic gold
medalist, most gold medals at a single Olympics when he won eight at Beijing in
2008
At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Phelps earned a historic eight gold medals, more
than any athlete in a single Olympics, while breaking world records in seven of
his eight races. Throughout the Games, fans and members of the media tried to
crack the code on what made Phelps -- who eventually won 23 Olympic gold medals
and became the most decorated Olympian of all time -- so unbeatable. His
mother, Debbie Phelps, was in Beijing, and often fielded their questions. Was
it his size-14 feet? His extra-long arms? His breakfast regimen? "No," Debbie
answered repeatedly. "It's his hard work." -- Alyssa Roenigk

***** 2. Serena_Williams, tennis *****
Key accomplishments: 23-time major champion (second most by any player all
time), women's record 365 major match wins, 73 career titles are fifth most by
a woman in the Open era
There is little that Williams didn't achieve during her record-setting career,
including winning 23 major titles. But it might have been her last one that was
the most improbable. She needed to win one more Grand Slam to break the tie
with Steffi Graf for most in the Open era (which began in 1968) -- a mark
Williams said she had been "chasing for a really long time" -- and remained in
the 2017 Australian Open draw even after finding out she was pregnant shortly
before competition began. She was in peak Serena form, never dropping a set en
route to a final showdown with her sister Venus. She defeated Venus to take
sole ownership of the record.
Williams played in four more major finals after her return from maternity leave
and a complicated childbirth. She didn't win another title. "The way I see it,
I should have had 30-plus Grand Slams," Williams_wrote_in_Vogue in a 2022 essay
announcing her impending retirement. "I didn't get there ... But I showed up 23
times, and that's fine. Actually it's extraordinary." -- D'Arcy Maine

***** 3. Lionel_Messi, soccer *****
Key accomplishments: 10-time LaLiga champion, seven-time Copa del Rey winner,
four-time Champions League winner, six-time Champions League top scorer, 17-
time FIFA FIFPRO World 11, World Cup winner, two-time Copa America winner, two-
time FIFA World Cup Golden Ball winner, eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, record
goal scorer for Barcelona and Argentina
Messi winning the World Cup in Argentina in 2022 was perhaps the biggest
Hollywood ending that soccer has ever seen. After losing the 2014 final, it
looked like it would never happen for Messi, who had won everything else in the
game for club and country, but the crowning moment of his career finally
arrived at age 34. He scored twice in the final as Argentina beat France on
penalties, sparking an outpouring of emotion and celebrations around the globe.
"This guy transcends rivalries -- even between Brazil and Argentina," Brazil
legend Ronaldo said. "I saw Brazilians and people all over the world rooting
for Messi. It's a fitting finale for a genius who has marked an era." -- Sam
Marsden

***** 4. LeBron_James, basketball *****
Key accomplishments: NBA 75th Anniversary team, NBA's all-time scoring leader,
20-time All-Star, 19-time All-NBA selection, six-time All-Defense, four-time
MVP, four-time Finals MVP, four-time NBA champion, three-time All-Star Game MVP
The "48 special" game happened 17 years ago this spring. That's when James
scored 29 of the last 30 points for the Cleveland_Cavaliers in a double-
overtime upset Game 5 road win against the Detroit_Pistons in the Eastern
Conference finals. The 48-point game was a mesmerizing performance that stands
as one of the classic games of this century ... and it probably doesn't even
rank in the top 10 of James' playoff performances. It might not be one of his
top three conference finals games. This is what James' greatness rests on: No
one has ever been this good for this long. That long-ago night in the Palace of
Auburn Hills is merely one of 29 40-point games James has in the playoffs
alone.
That win paved the way to his first Finals, starting a run of 10 appearances in
14 years. During that stretch he won four NBA titles, four MVPs and four Finals
MVPs with three different teams, as well as two Olympic gold medals. He also
won at least one road game in 29 consecutive playoff series. He has scored in
double figures in 1,222 consecutive regular-season games -- the last time he
didn't, his son Bronny, now his Laker teammate, was 2 years old. Volume isn't a
vogue way to measure achievement in the NBA anymore, and it lends credence to
those who want to push James down all-time lists. It's the only side of the
argument to take against James, who has essentially renamed the NBA's record
book for himself. -- Brian Windhorst

***** 5. Tom Brady, football *****
Key accomplishments: Seven-time Super Bowl champion, five-time Super Bowl MVP,
three-time NFL MVP, two-time AP Offensive POY, 15-time Pro Bowler, three-time
first-team All-Pro, NFL record for career passing yards/TDs
When Brady was asked which of his seven Super Bowl rings was his favorite, he
was fond of answering: "The next one." That sums up the player whom Bill
Belichick referred to as the "ultimate winner" who often played his best when
the stakes were highest. Belichick noted how Brady entered the NFL as a sixth-
round pick "with little to no fanfare" and left "as the most successful player
in league history." Said Belichick: "His relentless pursuit of excellence drove
him on a daily basis. His work ethic and desire to win were both motivational
and inspirational to teammates and coaches alike." -- Mike Reiss

***** 6. Roger_Federer, tennis *****
Key accomplishments: 20-time major champion, 369 majors wins, eight Wimbledon
titles (most by a man all time), 103 tour singles titles (second most by man in
Open era)
It's not unusual for a professional athlete to feel emotional during their
final match or game before retiring. But what is unusual is when everyone else
in the competition is equally emotional about it. Such was the case for Federer
during the last match of his career at the Laver Cup -- an event he co-founded
-- in 2022. Having previously announced a doubles match alongside Rafael_Nadal
would be his swan song, Nadal -- his fiercest of rivals for nearly 20 years -
- cried right alongside him when it was over, as did Novak_Djokovic, Andy
Murray, the rest of their European teammates and even Jack_Sock and Frances
Tiafoe, their opponents from the World team. "I think we are all going to be
forever grateful to be a part of the GOAT's final match," Sock said later. -

***** 7. Simone Biles, gymnastics *****
Key accomplishments: Seven-time Olympic medalist (tied for most by American
gymnast), four Olympic gold medals (2016, tied for most by female gymnast at
single Games)
Since winning her first national title in 2013, Biles has gone undefeated in
all-around competition in every meet she has competed in, a staggering
achievement in a sport that used to age-out athletes in their teens. Now 27,
Biles punctuated her return to gymnastics after taking two years off following
the Tokyo Games by winning U.S. trials by an astounding 5.5 points. In her
third Olympics in Paris, Biles can become the first gymnast to win all-around
gold in nonconsecutive Olympics. She also has five skills that bear her name -
- including a vault with the highest difficulty level in women's gymnastics. -

***** 8. Tiger_Woods, golf *****
Key accomplishments: 13 major wins (most of any player during span), 11 major
wins as world No. 1 golfer (nine more than any other player all time)
Even after a record-breaking career in which Woods won 82 times on the PGA
Tour, including 15 major championships, and was ranked the No. 1 golfer in the
world for 281 consecutive weeks and 683 overall, golf fans are still left
wondering what the Hall of Famer might have accomplished had injuries and self-
inflicted problems off the course not hampered him over the past 15 years.
That's a testament to Woods' greatness on the course, where he won 131 times
around the world. He won his first major at age 21 and brought youth and energy
to a sport that desperately needed it with his fist pumps and club twirls. -

***** 9. Usain Bolt, track *****
Key accomplishments:Eight-time Olympic gold medalist, 100m world-record holder,
only sprinter to win Olympic 100m and 200m titles at three consecutive Olympics
Their legs are a blur. What's in focus is Bolt's expressive mug as he surges
ahead in the 100-meter semifinal at the 2016 Rio Olympics, his fourth and final
Games. In the photo, the now 37-year-old Jamaican is looking back, smiling,
almost taunting the three men giving chase. The race is not over -- and yet it
is. The image was a sensation at the time and has endured as one of the most
indelible of Bolt's career, which saw him set his first world record in the 100
at 21. His 2009 world record in the 100 (9.58 seconds) still stands today. -

***** 10. Kobe Bryant, basketball *****
Key accomplishments: NBA 75th Anniversary team, Basketball Hall of Famer, five-
time champion, two-time Finals MVP, 2007-08 MVP, 18-time All-Star, 15-time All-
NBA selection, 12-time All-Defense, four-time All-Star Game MVP
For all of the accomplishments Bryant amassed, the five championships chief
among them, and all of the otherworldly scoring feats -- nine straight 40-point
games in 2003, four straight 50-point games in 2007, the 81-point night against
Toronto, the 60-point send-off against Utah -- his lasting achievement was
inspiration. The Lakers legend's self-described "Mamba mentality" has
transcended basketball, and sports for that matter, a branded way of life that
fans and admirers of Bryant aspire to reach. It promises that with enough
drive, enough work, enough will and enough focus, you too can shape your
existence the way Bryant did.
After a horrific helicopter_crash in 2020 killed Bryant, his daughter Gianna
and seven others, Bryant's impact continues to be felt posthumously. His name
is as relevant as ever in the NBA, with countless players paying homage to the
shooting guard by wearing Nos. 8 and 24 and the league renaming_the_All-Star
MVP_trophy in his honor. "He's like our generation's Jordan," Brooklyn_Nets
guard Cam_Thomas told_ESPN_last_season. "How the other guys liked Jordan,
that's how we are with Kobe." -- Dave McMenamin

***** 11. Novak Djokovic, tennis *****
Key accomplishments: 24-time Grand Slam singles champion; record 422 weeks as
No. 1; 375 Grand Slam match wins; third in men's singles titles (98), wins
(1,110) in Open era
Less than two months after being stunned in the Wimbledon final by Carlos
Alcaraz, Djokovic refused to postpone history again and earned his record-
breaking 24th men's major title at the 2023 US Open. After escaping a five-set
challenge in the third round, Djokovic didn't lose another set and defeated
Daniil_Medvedev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the final. At 36, he became the oldest man
to win the US Open, and tied Margaret Court's record for the most major titles
in history. To many, the feat secured his position as the sport's greatest of
all time, but, like a true competitor, he was far from satisfied. "I don't put

***** 12. Rafael Nadal, tennis *****
Key accomplishments: 22-time Grand Slam singles champion, ATP Tour title in 19
straight seasons, 209 weeks as world No. 1, fourth-most men's singles wins in
Open era
While Nadal has had success on all surfaces throughout his career, he was
rightfully deemed the "King of Clay" because of his dominance on the dirt. From
2005 to 2007, he had an 81-match win streak on the surface -- still the longest
stretch on a single surface by any man in the Open era. No one in history has
won more singles titles at an individual Slam than Nadal, the winner of 14
French Open titles, in Paris. He has an undefeated record in the final at the
tournament, and his reign has been so legendary and unprecedented that a statue
was erected in his honor in 2021 -- while he was still playing at the event.
Federer called Nadal's supremacy at the French Open "one of the greatest
achievements in sport." -- D'Arcy Maine

Ronaldo's story is one of a supremely talented athlete, but with a drive and
will to win to match. His career is best summed up by one of his own quotes:
"If you don't believe you are the best, then you will never achieve all that
you are capable of." Ronaldo has shown that belief throughout more than two
decades at the top of world soccer and often proved it to be true. "He is the
best," said his former Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho. "I saw Maradona a
couple of times. I never saw Pele. But Cristiano is amazing. This man is the
best. Cristiano is a goal machine. There will never be another Ronaldo." -- Rob

Key accomplishments: NBA 75th Anniversary team, four-time NBA champion, 2022
Finals MVP, 10-time All-Star, nine-time All-NBA, 2022 All-Star Game MVP, two-
time scoring leader, career leader in 3-pointers made
Curry had been reluctant to call himself the greatest shooter of all time until
he broke the career 3-point scoring record. Once he achieved that milestone in
December 2021, he wasn't so shy about it anymore. Curry has changed the way
basketball is played -- at every level of the sport. Nowadays you'll find kids
in high school gyms going through the same pregame shooting routine Curry does.
And in the NBA, offenses are built around 3-point shooting like never before.
If the way he revolutionized the game isn't enough to solidify his standing in
the NBA -- and among great athletes around the world -- his r√©sum√©is. After
winning his first Finals MVP in 2022, to go along with his four titles, 10 All-
Star appearances, nine All-NBA teams and two MVPs, Curry asked: "What are they
going to say now?" -- Kendra Andrews

"I was expecting a lot faster." That was Ledecky's response to winning the
1,500-meter freestyle by 20 seconds at Olympic trials in June, in the fastest
time clocked this year. For more than a decade, Ledecky has owned the race
known as the "swimmer's mile," which was added to the Olympic lineup in 2020.
The 27-year-old is expected to win gold again in Paris, where she is also the
favorite in the 400 free, 800 free and 4x200-meter relay. Since first breaking

The first 2¬Ω seasons of Duncan's stellar career came before the turn of the
century, but that didn't stop him from cementing his spot near the top of this
list. Even without a Rookie of the Year and his first NBA title, Duncan's run
in the early 2000s banked him both of his MVP awards. He earned the first in
2001-02 with a career-best average of 25.5 points, along with 12.7 rebounds,
3.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game. The Big Fundamental was also one of the
best defenders the league has seen, earning his final All-Defensive team nod in
2015 at 38 years old. -- Andrew Lopez

time champion, three-time Finals MVP, 1999-2000 MVP, nine-time All-Star, eight-
time All-NBA, two-time All-Defense
When Phil Jackson took a then 27-year-old O'Neal out to dinner during training
camp ahead of the 1999-2000 Lakers season, the Zen Master challenged the center
with a lofty objective. "I told him that he should make it his goal to be the
MVP," Jackson wrote in 2016. "In fact, I suggested to him that, by the time he
retired, they should rename the trophy the Shaq Award!"
O'Neal went on to win three MVPs during the ensuing campaign: He was named co-
MVP of the All-Star Game along with Tim Duncan for posting 22 points, 9
rebounds and 3 blocks in a win for the West; he was regular-season MVP after
averaging 29.7 points, 13.8 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 3.0 blocks; and he was
NBA Finals MVP after averaging 38 points on 61.1% shooting, 16.7 rebounds and
2.7 blocks in a six-game series win over the Indiana_Pacers to capture the
first of his three titles with the Lakers and four overall. The league never
named the trophy after O'Neal, but he did pick up the moniker "Most Dominant
Ever," which isn't a bad consolation prize. -- Dave McMenamin

Mahomes not only had one of the NFL's best passing seasons ever in 2018, but he
did it in his first year as a starter. That season he became only the second
quarterback to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns, joining the Broncos'
Peyton_Manning, who did it in 2013. Mahomes put himself on a fairly easy pace
in both statistical categories with a scorching start. He had 13 touchdown
passes in the first three games and threw for more than 300 yards in eight of
the first nine. He had two six-TD games that season and hasn't had one since. -

unless you do something with the platform it provides you," he said after

Donald went into his eighth NFL season with many significant achievements on

thing he was missing? A Super Bowl ring. He and the Rams won that during the
2021 season, beating the Cincinnati_Bengals in a game that went down to the
wire. On fourth down in a three-point game, Donald pressured Bengals
quarterback Joe_Burrow and forced an incomplete pass to essentially end the
game. Donald's celebration will be remembered, too: He ran around with his arms
outstretched and then pointed at his left ring finger, where his first Super
Bowl ring would go. -- Sarah Barshop

Key accomplishments: Hall of Famer (2021), two-time Super Bowl champion, five-

Manning already had a Hall of Fame career when he arrived in Denver in 2012 -
- 11 Pro Bowl selections, five first-team All-Pro selections, nine 4,000-yard
passing seasons and a Super Bowl win in his 14 years with the Colts. He signed
with the Broncos after a missed season in 2011, his fourth neck surgery and a
bit of uncertainty about whether physically he could play at the level he
wished. His four years in Denver answered those questions with four AFC West
titles, two Super Bowl trips and a Super Bowl win.
His masterpiece might have been the 2013 season, when the Broncos broke the
league's scoring record with 606 points and Manning set records with 5,477
passing yards and 55 touchdowns, including seven in the season opener. The
Broncos topped 40 points six times and 50 points three times. Current Dolphins
associate head coach and former Broncos assistant Eric Studesville said: "I've
never seen anything like Peyton and those guys that year. I don't think anybody
has. That was just an all-time great with the ball in his hands doing all-time

At 6-foot-4 and with a 47-inch vertical jump, Moss could reach or jump over the
tallest defensive backs who tried to cover him -- hence the phrase "You got

private workout before the 1998 draft, Moss also could run away from the
fastest defenders, be it on deep routes or even on what would now be called
"bubble screens." Other factors contributed to his success as well, but the

intelligence of Kevin McHale. ... He's the best passing big that I've seen, I
think, ever. [And] I know [Bill] Walton was one of [the best ever]." Rivers
might have actually undersold Jokic. This was before the Nuggets superstar won

Only three hitters have piled up more WAR since the century began than Trout,
and all of them had more than a decade head start on him when he launched,
fully formed, into the majors at age 19, two years after going 25th in the 2009
draft. That's how quickly Trout leaped into the conversation about the game's
historical elite. As perhaps the first star whose greatness was sharpened by
contemporary analytics, Trout's all-around dominance was on display from the

At 32, Trout has won three MVP awards and finished in the top five of balloting

2.48 ERA is the lowest for a starting pitcher since 1920 and his winning
percentage is the highest since 1900 for a pitcher with 2,000 innings. The Los
Angeles_Dodgers lefty has never been the hardest thrower, but he is a

the World Series, whacked an opposite-field home run off Roger Clemens and
charted a course that would end two decades later with 3,174 hits. Cabrera's
spray chart was a thing of beauty, with dots denoting his hits in all corners
of the stadium -- and 511 over the fence. He managed to hit for power without
sacrificing his innate bat-to-ball skill, and he peaked in 2012, when he became
the first hitter in 45 years to win batting, home run and RBI titles in the
same season. -- Jeff Passan

medalist, 2011 WNBA MVP, five-time WNBA Defensive Player of the Year, 10-time
WNBA All-Defensive first team, seven-time All-WNBA First Team, WNBA career
steals leader, 2002 WNBA Rookie of the Year, Basketball Hall of Famer.
Skilled as Catchings was, she is likely remembered for her motor more than any
other great women's basketball player. That's evident in her constant presence
on WNBA All-Defensive teams. Catchings was the No. 3 draft pick in 2001 because
she was coming off a knee injury that cut short her senior season at Tennessee.
She sat out that WNBA season but rewarded the Indiana_Fever for their patience
by becoming the face of the franchise. Nothing shows Catchings' impact more
than this: The Fever missed the playoffs just twice in her 15-season career but
haven't been back to the postseason since she retired in 2016. -- Michael

Key accomplishments: NBA 75th Anniversary team, Basketball Hall of Famer,
three-time NBA champion, 2006 Finals MVP, 13-time All-Star, eight-time All-NBA
selection, three-time All-Defense, 2010 All-Star Game MVP.
Who could forget that four-game Finals run Wade had? He averaged 30 points, 8
rebounds and 4 assists on 60% shooting ... in the 2011 NBA Finals the Miami
Heat lost to the Dallas_Mavericks. The brilliance of Wade's career was perhaps
dimmed a tad because he teamed up with LeBron James and Chris Bosh at the peak
of his powers. And the 2011 Finals will always be remembered for James'
stumbles and not Wade's singular brilliance that was essentially wasted. But
his career was spectacular and his 2006 Finals four-game run -- 39.3 points and
8.3 rebounds on 50% shooting (and 73 free throws) -- to lead the Heat to the
first of three titles is legendary.
In the two seasons before James arrived in Miami, Wade won the scoring title
and twice finished in the top five of the MVP voting. He willingly took a step
back for James, an act that undoubtedly helped the Heat jell and win back-to-
back titles even if it meant the end of his time at the top of those lists. It
was a team-first act he paired with a willingness to come off the bench in the
2008 Olympics for the Redeem Team. He still stands as one of the greatest
shooting guards of all time, the best shot-blocking guard in NBA history and a
flag-carrying member of the iconic 2003 draft class. -- Brian Windhorst

Moore was part of a 90-game winning streak and two perfect seasons at UConn.
Then as the WNBA's No. 1 pick in 2011, she helped the Minnesota_Lynx become a

winning followed wherever she went. In six of her eight WNBA seasons, the Lynx
reached the Finals. But Moore's career ended before expected as she stopped
playing at age 29 following the 2018 season to focus on social justice issues.
She worked tirelessly to help free her future husband, Jonathan Irons, whose

His most famous play is his "Star Wars" throw from his rookie season. His most
famous record is the 262 hits he registered in 2004. He was 27 when he came to
Seattle and he still finished with more than 3,000 hits -- indeed, more career
hits, if you include his Japanese totals, than Pete Rose. The iconic Ichiro hit
starts with the pull of the sleeve in the batter's box, the bat held high in
front of him, then comes outracing the ball to first base. "No single number
could ever explain a human as thrilling, as unusual, and as wonderful as
Ichiro," wrote sports columnist Joe Posnanski. -- David Schoenfield

Silver Slugger, two batting titles.
Bonds is the best living baseball player, and never was he better than the
eight seasons he played this century. In that time, he smashed the single-
season home run record, got on base at a 51.7% clip -- a figure last reached in
an individual year by Ted Williams in 1957 -- and came as close as anyone to
mastering the art of hitting. Bonds' steroid use has kept him out of the Hall

"I'm Kevin Durant. You know who I am. Y'all know who I am." That was Durant's
conclusion to a lengthy answer about pesky Patrick_Beverley's defense against
him (with a whole lot of help, as Durant noted) early in a 2019 playoff series.
Durant's point: He had proved himself as one of the best scorers to ever play
the game, a four-time scoring champion who had won the previous two NBA Finals
MVPs, a blend of size and skill that had never been seen before. Then he
averaged 41.5 points the rest of that series as the Warriors finished off the
Clippers. As he has bounced from team to team, there has been one constant
about KD's identity: When he's healthy, he has always been impossible to guard.

Will Verlander be baseball's last 300-game winner? He'll have to coax 40 more

it'll be Verlander who does it. A true throwback to the days when ace pitchers

in a way that harkens back to the days of Tom Seaver, Bob Gibson and Nolan
Ryan. With 260 wins and 3,300-plus strikeouts under his belt and more on the
way, this is what Verlander always wanted to be. "I love being a pitcher,"
Verlander said in 2018. "When I first started playing baseball, I always

Nowitzki revolutionized the way the NBA game is played, a pioneer as a sweet-
shooting 7-footer who thrived as a perimeter threat. But the big German is best
remembered for an iconic post move he developed midway through his career. It
was his most lethal weapon when Nowitzki shattered "soft Euro" stereotypes by
leading the Dallas Mavericks to their lone title. His one-legged fadeaway is
captured on the statue that stands outside the American Airlines Center and has
the inscription "Loyalty never fades away" -- a nod to Nowitzki's record-

When the Milwaukee_Bucks selected a skinny kid from Greece who had been playing

impossible to predict how his arrival would alter the franchise's trajectory
for the next decade. Antetokounmpo transformed himself from an unknown but
promising prospect into one of the most dominant power forwards in history at
both ends of the floor -- culminating in a 50-point game in the 2021 NBA Finals
to clinch the franchise's first championship in 50 years. The fact that he
ordered 50 chicken nuggets the next day to celebrate only endeared him to
Milwaukee fans even more. -- Jamal Collier

On March 11, 2023, Shiffrin chased down a record that, for 34 years, consumed
the minds and careers of countless ski racers and became the winningest alpine
skier in history. She won her 87th World Cup race that day, eclipsing the
longstanding record held by Swedish legend Ingemar Stenmark, which many
considered to be unbreakable. She did it, of course, quickly, reaching 87 wins
nearly three years quicker than Stenmark and by winning at least one race in
all six World Cup disciplines -- the only woman or man ever to do so.
But what's most remarkable about Shiffrin's feat is that she won 24 races and
two of her five World Cup overall titles after skiing the most disappointing
races of her career at the 2022 Beijing Olympics and having people question
whether her best years were behind her. -- Alyssa Roenigk

champion, 2013 World Series MVP, 10-time All-Star, seven-time Silver Slugger,
531 HR (third most since 2000).
Above everything, Big Papi will be remembered for feasting in the biggest of
moments. As the game's greatest designated hitter, Ortiz had Cooperstown
numbers -- 541 career homers and a .931 OPS -- but that's only the tip of
Papi's boisterous iceberg. He had 17 career playoff homers as part of three
championship Boston_Red_Sox clubs and hit .455 over 14 World Series games. That
includes 2013, when, at age 37, he went 11-for-16 with two homers and eight
walks in the Fall Classic against a St._Louis_Cardinals team that could not get
him out.
After Ortiz was elected to the Hall of Fame, longtime teammate Dustin Pedroia

Scherzer pitched the most dominant back-to-back games in MLB history. On June
14, 2015, he pitched a 16-strikeout one-hitter, allowing only a bloop single.
In his next start, he lost a perfect game when he hit the 27th batter. He has
had a record-tying 20-strikeout game, postseason heroics and one of the
greatest months ever in June 2019 (6-0, 1.00 ERA, 68 strikeouts) -- which he
accomplished with a broken nose. He threw 98 mph while mixing in four other
pitches. Most of all, though, the lasting image will be his intensity, notably
his stomping around on the mound after recording another strikeout. -- David

Key accomplishments: Seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion (tied for most all

titles (2006-10).
The challenge when it comes to covering Johnson's career is having to
continuously find new ways to express, "Hey y'all, this guy, he's really great
at racing stock cars, isn't he?!" And that's only the second-best compliment I
can give to the man who won seven NASCAR Cup Series titles, equaling Richard
Petty and Dale Earnhardt, including five in a row, a mark of which The King and
The Intimidator never came close.
But Johnson's most mind-bending accomplishment is that he won those Cups even
as the system that awarded them was seemingly and repeatedly rigged against
him. The paddock called it "Jimmie Proofing" as his septet of titles were
earned via three different points systems and four postseason format
variations, all while steering three wildly different generations of race cars.
Meanwhile, he somehow has remained true to his SoCal desert town, trailer park
roots -- as kind and humble as he was fast and unbeatable. -- Ryan McGee

his most amazing feat is undoubtedly going the whole Premier League season
unbeaten with Arsenal in 2004. He was outstanding in that campaign, leading his
team to an achievement never repeated since in modern English football.
"I believe Thierry was on the same level as Pele and Maradona, definitely. He

Before words like "efficiency" and "pace" became as common part of the NBA
parlance as "slam dunk" and "pick-and-roll," there was a diminutive guard from
Canada who, as a contemporary of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal in the late
1990s through early 2000s, ended up with as many regular-season MVPs as the two
of them combined. Under the revolutionary tutelage of coach Mike D'Antoni with
the Phoenix_Suns, Nash won the award in 2005 and 2006 as the point guard on the
heralded "7 Seconds or Less" teams that made it to three Western Conference
finals in six years. While Nash never won a ring, he maximized his talents as a
6-foot-3 point guard, shooting 50% overall, 40% from 3 and 90% from the free
throw line in four seasons and leading the league in assists five times. -

The lore of Beltre has grown since his retirement following the 2018 season and
placed him alongside Mike_Schmidt and Brooks Robinson among the game's best
third basemen. No one at third played more games than Beltre, a testament to
his willingness to grit through pain. He manned the position with grace and
consistency, two tenets that apply to the rest of his game. Beltre's counting

2008 Art Ross Trophy.
There isn't a player in the NHL who has commanded a slap shot like Ovechkin in
his career. Even if Father Time has begun catching up in some areas, the pure
power behind his signature shot remains. Ovechkin's success scoring 853 goals
(to date) has come in large part because of how he uses a big frame (6-foot-2)
to add velocity and power behind a shot that can exceed 100 mph. When Ovechkin
puts his weight behind a puck -- particularly from his favorite right-circle

Key accomplishments: Ballon d'Or winner, six-time Champions League winner,
four-time LaLiga winner, World Cup finalist, Croatia's most-capped player,
joint-most trophies won with Real Madrid.
"I'd like to ask you to never retire." As news conference questions go, it was
unconventional, but the Italian journalist's plea -- after Modriƒá's Croatia was
eliminated from Euro 2024 -- was met with applause, echoing the sentiment.
Everybody loves Modriƒá. "As well as being a top player, one of the best in the
world, he's even more spectacular as a person," Real Madrid coach Carlo
Ancelotti said. More than any other player, Modriƒá was fundamental in creating
Madrid's relentless winning culture over the past decade. There's no one
standout moment -- bar, perhaps, leading underdogs Croatia to a World Cup final
in 2018 -- but rather year after year of consistent excellence. -- Alex

winner, three-time Champions League winner, Champions League Player of the
Season winner, World Cup winner, two-time Ballon d'Or winner, two-time The Best
FIFA Women's Player winner.
Putellas' career has been a battle on and off the pitch. On the pitch, she has
transformed Spanish soccer, playing a part in Bar√ßa winning three Champions
Leagues in four years and Spain becoming world champions. Off the pitch, she
led the fight against the Spanish Football Federation for improved working
conditions. She has become an icon in Barcelona, where her image has filled
huge advertising boards in the city centre, and she is known as La Reina. "She
is the captain and the queen of Barcelona for a reason," teammate Lucy Bronze
said after Putellas' goal in the 2024 Champions League final. "She showed today
why she is a back-to-back Ballon d'Or winner." -- Sam Marsden

Known as Megatron, Johnson was at the peak of his powers in 2012. That's when
he set an NFL single-season record with 1,964 receiving yards, breaking Jerry
Rice's record of 1,848 that had stood since 1985. "It was an unbelievable thing
to play with a guy like that. I think from day one, I knew that I was throwing
to a Hall of Famer as long as he stayed healthy," Matthew_Stafford, Johnson's
quarterback during the receiver's last seven seasons with the Detroit_Lions,
told ESPN in 2021. "He was a special player and a great person, a great
teammate." At 6-foot-5 and 237 pounds, Johnson possessed a 42¬Ω-inch vertical
leap that allowed him to outjump defenders in video game fashion. -- Eric

Watt won three NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards in his career, but his

that in his career, as well as 59 solo tackles, 29 tackles for loss, four
forced fumbles and an 80-yard interception return for a touchdown. Watt had
another defensive touchdown that season, and he had three offensive touchdowns.
He won his second NFL Defensive Player of the Year award that season and
finished second to quarterback Aaron_Rodgers in MVP voting. Watt received 13 of
50 MVP votes that season, the most by a defender since Lawrence Taylor won the
award in 1986. -- Sarah Barshop

Key accomplishments: Since Jan. 1, 2000: Hall of Famer, two-time World Series
winner, 11-time All-Star, 523 saves and 29 postseason saves (both most since
2000).
Rivera was inevitability personified. Thriving in baseball's most mercurial of
roles -- the ninth-inning reliever -- he emerged from the bullpen to the
pounding tones of Metallica's "Enter Sandman" night after night, year after
year. Every time he did so, dread-filled Yankees opponents knew the bell was
tolling -- for them. Armed with one pitch -- a cutter that righty hitters waved
at and lefty hitters could not barrel up -- Rivera became New York's closer in
1997 and never put up anything but stellar seasons on his way to a 2.21
lifetime ERA and record 652 saves. For all of that, he was better than anyone
in the postseason, posting a 0.70 ERA and 42 saves over 96 playoff games. -

Parker was known for being able to play any position, but at 6-foot-4 she was
lethal as a post player with a diverse skill set. In college, Parker led
Tennessee to coach Pat Summitt's last two NCAA titles, in 2007 and 2008. The
No. 1 WNBA draft pick by the Sparks in 2008, Parker had an epic first pro
season: She was MVP and Rookie of the Year (no other player has done that) and
won Olympic gold. She spent 13 of her 16 WNBA seasons with the Sparks, but won
WNBA titles with Los Angeles, Chicago and Las Vegas. -- Michael Voepel

Lewis redefined the middle linebacker position as a three-down defender who
made plays from sideline to sideline. His ability to make teammates around him
better established a storied tradition of defense in Baltimore. From 2000 to
'12, the Ravens' defense ranked among the top three in the NFL in seven of the
10 seasons in which Lewis played at least six games. "Before we get to his
play, Ray is the greatest leader in team sports history," said Shannon Sharpe,

When ESPN runs the sequel to this exercise in 2050, Ohtani is the likeliest
candidate from baseball to rate worthy of the top 10. His first seven years in
MLB have been transcendent. What before him was taken as fact -- that nobody
can hit and pitch at a high enough level to warrant doing both -- is now null.
Ohtani arrived from Japan with a freighter of hype and only exceeded it,
stretching the definition of what a baseball player can be. "Shohei," Dodgers

Key accomplishments: 11-time Olympic medalist, seven-time Olympic gold
medalist, record 18-time world championship medalist.
Five Olympics. Eleven medals. Greatest U.S. runner in Olympic history. But a
closer look at Felix's seven Olympic gold medals reveals another side to her
success. In a sport defined by individual success, she might also be the
greatest teammate in history. Felix won six of her seven Olympic gold medals as
part of relays: two in the 4x100 meters and four in the 4x400. Her only
individual gold came at the 2012 London Games in the 200 meters after taking
silver in the previous two Olympics. That Felix experienced so much of her
success while supporting her teammates comes as no surprise.
In the years since she retired from the sport, she has been an outspoken

for women athletes after childbirth. -- Alyssa Roenigk

Hamm is perhaps the first global superstar to emerge out of women's soccer, and
she was a reluctant one at that. But on the field, in contrast, she played with
the confidence and killer instinct you'd expect from one of the world's
greatest goal scorers. She had a knack for exceptional ball control and
precision in her shots. That's why she still is the No. 2 goals leader for the

Currently the best soccer player in the world, Mbapp√© has followed the path of
an absolute prodigy of the game. He made his professional debut at 16, scored
his first goal at 17, played for France at 18 and won the World Cup at 19! His
move from PSG to Real Madrid this summer will take him to new heights and will
strengthen even more his status as the heir of Lionel Messi and Cristiano
Ronaldo.
In 2018, he took the world by storm and became the second teenager in history
alongside Pel√© to score in a World Cup final. In 2022, he made more World Cup
history with his hat trick in the World Cup final loss against Argentina. "He

Key accomplishments:UFC light heavyweight and heavyweight champion, youngest
fighter to win a UFC championship, most wins in UFC light heavyweight history
(20), most wins in UFC title fights (15), tied for most successful title
defenses in UFC history (11), longest unbeaten streak in UFC history (19), UFC
Hall of Famer.
There's a reason UFC president Dana White calls Jones the greatest mixed
martial artist to ever live. In a sport where the margin between victory and
defeat is razor thin, Jones has managed to go 16 years without being defeated
by an opponent (his only "loss" came via controversial DQ to Matt Hamill in
2009).
After becoming the youngest fighter to win a UFC championship in 2011, Jones
went dominant on a litany of Hall of Fame caliber fighters for the next four
years, with impressive wins over the likes of Daniel Cormier, Quinton "Rampage"
Jackson, Lyoto Machida, Vitor Belfort and Rashad Evans. Not only did he beat
them, but he did so by playing to his opponent's strengths and then running
roughshod over them. The r√©sum√© is undeniable, and the accolades are still
piling up. -- Andreas Hale

leader, 2011-12 Sixth Man of the Year.
Harden will go down as one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history, but The

his scoring spree with an MVP season in 2017-18, averaging 30.4 points, 8.8
assists and 5.4 rebounds. And he was even better the following season,
averaging 36.1 points in 2018-19 -- the eighth-highest average in NBA history.
Only Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin_Baylor and Michael_Jordan have averaged more
points in a single season. He then averaged 34.3 points in 2019-20 to win his
third consecutive scoring title. His scoring overshadows his other elite skill
as a passer. Harden is the only player in NBA history to win three scoring
titles and two assist titles. -- Ohm Youngmisuk

While history continues to define Mickelson's legacy after he recruited golfers
to the Saudi Arabian-funded LIV Golf League, there's no denying he was once
among the most popular players in the world. The golfer known as Lefty broke an
0-for-46 drought in majors when he captured the 2004 Masters. He mesmerized
fans with his incredible short game and won them over with a shy grin and
thumbs-up gestures. He became the sport's oldest major champion at age 50 when
he won the 2021 PGA Championship -- and was a pariah in his sport less than a
year later. -- Mark Schlabach

Key accomplishments: NBA 75th Anniversary Team, Basketball Hall of Famer, 2011
NBA champion, eight-time All-Star, eight-time All-Defense, five-time All-NBA
selection, four-time assists leader.
If not for Shaquille O'Neal and Tim Duncan and the Lakers and Spurs dynasties
of the early 2000s, Kidd might've had another championship and an MVP on his
illustrious r√©sum√©. During his first two seasons in New Jersey, Kidd was at the
peak of a career that saw him finish as one of the game's most elite passers
and versatile triple-double threats. Kidd made teammates better everywhere he
went, which was never more evident than during his first season in New Jersey
in 2001-02, when he turned the Nets around from 26 wins the season before to 52
wins, leading to the franchise's first Finals appearance.
Kidd, though, finished second in MVP voting to Duncan before being swept in the
Finals by O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. The following season, Kidd got the Nets back
to the Finals only to lose in six games to Duncan and the Spurs. He would
finally get a championship ring playing alongside Dirk Nowitzki in Dallas in
2011. -- Ohm Youngmisuk

On July 11, 2010, Iniesta changed Spanish football forever. In the 116th minute
of the World Cup final in Johannesburg, South Africa -- the game, tied at 0-0,
had gone to extra time -- Iniesta collected a pass from Cesc Fabregas inside
the penalty box, and coolly fired the bouncing ball low past Netherlands

Key accomplishments: Since Jan. 1, 2000: 35-6-2 pro record, multidivision world

Pacquiao was unknown when he first fought in the U.S in 2001, but he became a
record eight-division world champion. His all-attack, buzz saw style, with
punches thrown from all angles, overwhelmed ring greats such as Marco Antonio
Barrera, Erik Morales, Oscar De La Hoya and Miguel Cotto.
His fight against Floyd Mayweather took five years to finally happen, and while
it didn't deliver the entertainment boxing fans were expecting, it generated
more than $600 million in total revenue. Pacquiao also had a memorable feud
with Juan Manuel Marquez, winning the first three fights and losing the fourth
by KO. Pacquiao recovered from that defeat in 2012 to win six more welterweight

Key accomplishments: Three-time Olympic gold medalist in halfpipe (2006, 2010,

White stood at the top of the halfpipe at the 2018 Olympics and prepared to
take his third and final run. He was in second place behind two-time silver
medalist Ayumu Hirano, who had just landed back-to-back 1440s. White knew he
needed to land the combo to best Hirano, but four months earlier, he'd crashed
attempting to learn a cab double cork 1440 and suffered horrific injuries that
required 62 stitches in his face and landed him in intensive care.
White hadn't attempted the trick since, and he'd never landed back-to-back 14s.
But in a move that embodied White's competitive nature and the spirit of action
sports, he went for the combo, rode away clean and won his third Olympic gold
in the event. "Before my last run, I was like, 'OK, I can live with second,'"
White said that night. "But I realized at that moment, I didn't have to." -

It was a hot, sweltering day early in spring training. The Red Sox were coming
off a 2018 World Series title and the training staff had players running a cone
drill. Most took it slow and leisurely. One did not. Maybe that helps explain
why Betts is perhaps the perfect ballplayer -- a remarkable hitter for average
and power, a right fielder who can execute the impossible throw (ask Tony
Kemp), an athlete who can move to shortstop mid-career. A Harvard analysis from
2021 named Betts the best all-around player in MLB history: Yes, Betts is good

Xavi had so many career highs that it's impossible to pick just one. You might

four of the goals. Or his performance in the 2009 Champions League final,
supplying the pass for Lionel Messi's headed opening goal. You could pick
Barcelona's dominant 3-1 win over Manchester United in 2011. For a game that
summed up an era, you'd highlight Spain's 4-0 demolition of Italy at Euro 2012,
the apotheosis of their tiki-taka short-passing style, which Xavi personified.

Arguably no fighter in UFC history bridged the gap better from the sport's

represented everything mixed martial arts was looking for. He was essentially
perfect in those years, winning 14 of 15 bouts, including 12 title fights. At

Key accomplishments: Eight-time Olympic medalist, three-time Olympic gold
medalist, record five 100-meter world titles, oldest sprinter (35 in 2022) to
win world title.
One day after Usain Bolt's win in the 100 meters at the 2008 Beijing Olympics,
Fraser-Pryce became the first woman from the Caribbean to win Olympic gold in
the event. Four years later, she defended her title in the 100 (as did Bolt),
further cementing Jamaica's reputation as a sprinting powerhouse. Only 5 feet
tall and typically sporting rainbow locks, the "Pocket Rocket'' has medaled in
track and field's fastest race in the past four Games. In Paris, her fifth and

her title as the fastest woman alive. -- Alyssa Roenigk

Key accomplishments: 55-8-2 record (32 KOs) from 1988 to 2016, oldest ever
boxing world champion at age 49, 20 middleweight title defenses, two-division
world champion
Hopkins' otherworldly longevity saw him fittingly call himself "The Alien" late
in a 28-year professional career. He made a record 20 world middleweight title
defenses (1996-2005) and stopped Oscar De La Hoya with a body shot to become
undisputed champion in 2004. The Philadelphia native's ring IQ and exceptional
conditioning allowed him to win world titles well into his 40s. In 2011,
Hopkins outpointed Jean Pascal for the light heavyweight title to become the
oldest boxing world champion at 46 years old. Two years later, Hopkins won back
a light heavyweight title, and in 2014, at age 49, he defeated light
heavyweight champion Beibut Shumenov.-- Nick Parkinson

He was on the cover of Sports Illustrated at 16 with the headline "Baseball's

the best postseason numbers of all time. He even helped make baseball fun again
-- from his all-out style of play to his green Phillie Phanatic cleats. Rarely

Once a part of the sport's Big Four, Murray was essentially removed from the
conversation as Federer, Nadal and Djokovic emerged in a league of their own.
But even while his tally of three major championships pales in comparison to
those of his top peers, there was perhaps no victory more memorable than
Murray's first title at Wimbledon in 2013. A year after coming devastatingly
close to winning his home Slam, a determined Murray held off Djokovic in three
convincing sets to win his maiden major title. Never one to be able to hide his
emotions, Murray openly sobbed on the court after the victory, proving just how
much it meant to him. The BBC called the achievement "the Holy Grail" for
British sport. -- D'Arcy Maine

Swoopes, a key part of the Houston Comets' dynasty, won the last of her four

three-level scoring, she was also one of the best disrupters of passing lanes
in women's hoops history, which helped lead to her being honored as the WNBA's

Over an eight-year period from 2009 to 2016, Uchimura dominated men's
gymnastics, going undefeated in all-around competition, winning back-to-back
Olympic titles and leading the Japanese team to gold at the Rio Games. He
retired from the sport in 2022 with a reputation for pairing extreme difficulty
with unmatched consistency and flawless execution and is widely considered to
be the GOAT of men's gymnastics.
In one of his most memorable all-around performances, Uchimura averaged higher

transforming the LA_Clippers from annual punching bags to perennial playoff
contenders while orchestrating the unforgettable Lob City teams. Before Paul's
arrival in Los Angeles, the franchise had made the postseason just seven times
in its history.
Paul's Clippers made the playoffs six consecutive times as he delivered some of
the most scintillating alley-oops in NBA history to Blake Griffin and DeAndre
Jordan. Clippers fans won't forget Paul's Game 7-winning running bank shot that

is one of three players to be a three-time WNBA MVP. She led the Storm to the
2004 and 2010 league titles, and her 2007 and 2006 seasons are the top two in
player efficiency rating in WNBA history. Jackson was known for her powerful

Not even an LA Clippers tenure marred by injuries can diminish a legacy that
only a handful of players in history can match or top. Leonard is one of 12
players to ever win two NBA Finals MVP trophies. None of them, however, led a
Canadian team to the country's first NBA championship. In leading Toronto to
the title in 2019, Leonard cemented himself as one of the game's most clutch
players when healthy in the playoffs. He delivered one of the most legendary
buzzer-beaters in playoff history when his twisting corner jumper softly
bounced on the rim four times and in to eliminate Philadelphia in Game 7 of the
Eastern Conference semifinals that season.
Even during his five-year Clippers tenure, Leonard has shown signs of dominance

hasn't done since the 2020 bubble. -- Ohm Youngmisuk

Key accomplishments: Seven-time major singles champ, five-time Wimbledon champ,
270 major match wins (fifth most by a woman in the Open era), a record 89
career major appearances in singles.
The elder Williams sister burst onto the tennis scene as an enthusiastic and
joyful teenager, and likely would have won many more titles if not for the
arrival of Serena. While Williams' results have been remarkable, and she has
the most major titles among active women on tour, she has been equally
influential off the court as a champion for gender equality in tennis and
beyond.
While advocating for equal pay at Wimbledon, Williams asked tournament
officials at a meeting a simple question: "Would you want your daughter or your
sister or your mother or your wife or a loved one to be a woman paid less?'"
Wimbledon started offering equal prize money for men and women in 2007.
Williams called the achievement "the best moment of my career" in 2023. -

Golden Ball winner 1998 men's World Cup, Golden Boot winner 2002 men's World

The original Ronaldo was probably the fastest, most powerful striker running
with the ball in the history of the game, capable of variations at pace and
able to slow down, keep his head still and shoot at goal with cool precision.
All of these virtues were best seen in the 20th century -- but the 21st came up
with the best storyline. Twice his knee collapsed beneath him and he was left
howling in gruesome pain. Many thought the second time was the end of his
career.
In the buildup to the 2002 World Cup, Inter Milan, his Italian club, could not
get him fit. Brazil took charge, and he took the tournament by storm, carrying
a side that nearly failed to qualify all the way to a memorable triumph. It is
one of the great comeback stories in the history of sport. -- Tim Vickery

Halladay was the product of a bygone era in which a pitcher endeavored to
finish what he started. Never gifted with overwhelming velocity, Halladay
killed with paper cuts. He walked hitters at an almost identical rate to Greg
Maddux and logged 220-plus-inning seasons like they were nothing. His right arm
got the glory, but it was Halladay's brain -- his innate sense of how to pitch
to every hitter -- that won him 203 games. When he died in a plane crash in
2017, a profound sadness spread through the sport. The great pitching artisan
was gone, never to be replicated. -- Jeff Passan

Colonial Tournament in 2003. It's that when Sorenstam retired from full-time

Of all the superlatives and milestones that can be used to explain Rodgers'

in touchdown-to-interception ratio (475 TDs, 105 INTS). In that way, he was the
anti-Brett Favre, yet he carried on Favre's remarkable run of success in Green
Bay before getting traded to the Jets. Packers coach Matt LaFleur perhaps
described Rodgers' impact best when he said near the end of Rodgers' run with

Before Martinez and his 2004 Boston teammates ended the franchise's epic World

the "Curse of the Bambino." One of Martinez's answers summed up how a short,
skinny righty could become one of the most dominant hurlers ever: "I don't
believe in damn curses. Wake up the damn Bambino and have me face him. Maybe
I'll drill him in the a--." From 1997 to 2003, the height of one of baseball's

Reed was the ultimate defensive game changer of his generation. In 2004, he set
an NFL record by returning an interception 106 yards for a touchdown against
the Browns. Four years later, he broke his own record with a 107-yarder against
the Eagles. Reed is the only player in NFL history to score touchdowns off a
punt return, blocked punt, interception and fumble recovery.
"You see the safety's out in the middle of the field and have a wide-open throw
on the right. The next thing you know he's intercepting it," former Steelers
quarterback Ben Roethlisberger said. "Where did he come from? It's impossible.
That's what made it such a challenge. He made the impossible possible." -

***** 100. Charles Woodson, football *****
Key accomplishments: Hall of Famer (2021), nine-time Pro Bowler, three-time
first-team All-Pro, HOF All-2000s team, 2009 Defensive Player of the Year.
Woodson's career was a three-act play. In Oakland, as a Heisman Trophy-winning
No. 4 pick, he was a hard-partying, hard-playing Hall of Fame talent. In Green
Bay, he became a Hall of Famer. And with his return to the Raiders, he became a
legend, making the switch from wild youngster at cornerback to sage vet at free
safety. And if he lost a step, it was one precious few others ever had. "It was
a beautiful transition," Woodson said, "if you will." And his first NFL coach,
Jon Gruden, most certainly would. The slower-paced lifestyle of Green Bay
helped Woodson, well, slow down and center himself. "And he met and married the
right woman and had kids," Gruden said. -- Paul Gutierrez

***** Methodology *****
Experts in individual sports were asked to vote to rank the top athletes in
their sport since Jan. 1, 2000 (no accomplishments before this date were to be
considered). Those votes pared down pools in each sport to lists of 10 to 25
athletes each, which constituted the overall candidate pool for the top
athletes of the 21st century so far. Each voter was presented two randomly
selected names and asked to pick which one has had the better career in the
21st century. Across repeated, randomized head-to-head matchups, more than
70,000 votes were cast at this stage, and using an Elo rating system, the list
was pared down from 262 to 100. That list was then evaluated by a panel of
experts for any inconsistencies or oversights, resulting in the top 100 ranking
seen here.

Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 ‚Äì June 25, 2009) was an American
singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the "King of Pop", he is
regarded as one_of_the_most_significant_cultural_figures_of_the_20th_century.
Over a four-decade career, his_world_record_music_achievements and publicized
personal life made him a global figure. His innovations in the 1980s creatively
elevated the music video medium and broke racial_barriers. Through songs,
stages, and fashion, he proliferated visual performance for singers in pop
music, and popularized street dance moves including the moonwalk (to which he
named), the robot, and the anti-gravity_lean.
As part of the Jackson_family, Michael at age six made his public debut in 1964
with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the
Jackson_5 (later known as the Jacksons). The Jackson 5 signed with Motown in
1968 and achieved worldwide success with Michael as lead singer. Jackson began
his solo career in 1971 while at Motown and recorded multiple successful
singles. He became a global solo star with his 1979 album Off_the_Wall. His
music_videos, including those for "Beat_It", "Billie_Jean", and "Thriller" from
his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial_barriers and
transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. He helped
popularize MTV and continued to innovate with videos for his albums Bad (1987),
Dangerous (1991), HIStory:_Past,_Present_and_Future,_Book_I (1995), and
Invincible (2001). Thriller is the best-selling_album_of_all_time, and Bad was
the first album to produce five US Billboard_Hot_100 number-one singles.[nb_1]
From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due
to his_changing_appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he
was_accused_of_sexually_abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was
settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence.
In 2005, he was_tried_and_acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations
and several other charges. The Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation found no
evidence_of_criminal_conduct by Jackson. In 2009, while he was preparing for a
series of comeback concerts, This_Is_It, Jackson died from an overdose of
propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad_Murray, who was
convicted_in_2011 of involuntary_manslaughter for his involvement in Jackson's
death. His death triggered reactions around the world, creating unprecedented
surges of internet traffic and a spike in sales of his music. Jackson's
televised_memorial_service, held at the Staples_Center in Los Angeles, was
estimated to have been viewed by more than 2.5¬†billion people.
Jackson is one of the best-selling_music_artists_of_all_time, with estimated
sales of over 500 million records worldwide.[nb_2] He had 13 Billboard_Hot_100
number-one_singles (the_chart's_fourth-highest_of_any_artist) and was the first
artist to have a top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 in five different
decades. Jackson's inductions include the Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame (twice),
the National_Rhythm_&_Blues_Hall_of_Fame, the Vocal_Group_Hall_of_Fame, the
Songwriters_Hall_of_Fame and the Dance_Hall_of_Fame (making him the only
recording artist to be inducted). His honors include 15 Grammy_Awards including
the Grammy_Legend_Award, six Brit_Awards, 24 American_Music_Awards, a Golden
Globe_Award and 39 Guinness_World_Records, including "Youngest_artist_to_top
the_Hot_100", "Longest span of number ones for a male act", and the "Most
Successful Entertainer of All Time", among other_awards.

Indiana, pictured in March 2010
Michael Joseph Jackson[3][4] was born in Gary,_Indiana, on August 29, 1958.[5]
[6] He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson_family, a working-class
African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street.[7][8]
His mother, Katherine_Esther_Jackson (n√©e Scruse), played clarinet and piano,
had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at
Sears.[9] She was a Jehovah's_Witness.[10] His father, Joseph_Walter_"Joe"
Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at US_Steel and played guitar
with a local rhythm_and_blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's
income.[11][12] Joe's great-grandfather, July "Jack" Gale, was a US Army scout;
family lore held that he was also a Native American medicine_man.[13] Michael
grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La_Toya, and Janet) and five brothers
(Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy).[11] A sixth brother, Marlon's twin
Brandon, died shortly after birth.[14]
In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers‚Äîa band formed by their
father which included Jackie, Tito and Jermaine‚Äîas backup musicians playing
congas and tambourine.[15][16] Michael said his father told him he had a "fat
nose",[17] and physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He
recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his
siblings rehearsed, ready to punish any mistakes.[10][18] Joe acknowledged that
he regularly whipped Michael.[19] Katherine said that although whipping came to
be considered abuse, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael
was growing up.[20][21] Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon denied that their
father was abusive and said that the whippings, which had a deeper impact on
Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble.[22]
Michael said that during his youth he was lonely and isolated.[23]
Later in 1965, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the group's
name was changed to the_Jackson_5.[24] In 1965, the group won a talent show;
Michael performed the dance to Robert_Parker's 1965 song "Barefootin'" and sang
the_Temptations' "My_Girl".[25] From 1966 to 1968, the Jacksons 5 toured the
Midwest; they frequently played at a string of black clubs known as the
Chitlin'_Circuit as the opening act for artists such as Sam_&_Dave, the_O'Jays,
Gladys_Knight and Etta_James. The Jackson 5 also performed at clubs and
cocktail lounges, where striptease shows were featured, and at local
auditoriums and high school dances.[26][27] In August 1967, while touring the
East_Coast, they won a weekly amateur night concert at the Apollo_Theater in
Harlem.[28]

Jackson (center) as a member of the Jackson 5 in 1972. The group were among the
first African_American performers to attain a crossover following.[29]
The Jackson 5 recorded several songs for a Gary record label, Steeltown
Records; their first single, "Big_Boy", was released in 1968.[30] Bobby Taylor
of Bobby_Taylor_&_the_Vancouvers brought the Jackson 5 to Motown after they
opened for Taylor at Chicago's Regal_Theater in 1968. Taylor produced some of
their early Motown recordings, including a version of "Who's_Lovin'_You".[31]
After signing with Motown, the Jackson family relocated to Los Angeles.[32] In
1969, Motown executives decided Diana_Ross should introduce the Jackson 5 to
the public ‚Äî partly to bolster her career in television ‚Äî sending off what was
considered Motown's last product of its "production line".[33] The Jackson 5
made their first television appearance in 1969 in the Miss_Black_America
pageant, performing a cover of "It's_Your_Thing".[34] Rolling_Stone later
described the young Michael as "a prodigy" with "overwhelming musical gifts"
who "quickly emerged as the main draw and lead singer".[35]
In January 1970, "I_Want_You_Back" became the first Jackson 5 song to reach
number one on the US Billboard_Hot_100; it stayed there for four weeks. Three
more singles with Motown topped the chart: "ABC", "The_Love_You_Save", and
"I'll_Be_There".[36] In May 1971, the Jackson family moved into a large house
at Hayvenhurst, a 2-acre (0.81¬†ha) estate in Encino,_California.[37] During
this period, Michael developed from a child performer into a teen_idol.[38]
Between 1972 and 1975, he released four solo studio albums with Motown: Got_to
Be_There (1972), Ben (1972), Music_&_Me (1973) and Forever,_Michael (1975).[39]
"Got_to_Be_There" and "Ben", the title tracks from his first two solo albums,
sold well as singles, as did a cover of Bobby_Day's "Rockin'_Robin".[40]
Michael maintained ties to the Jackson 5.[39] The Jackson 5 were later
described as "a cutting-edge example of black crossover_artists".[41] They were
frustrated by Motown's refusal to allow them creative input.[42] Jackson's
performance of their top five single "Dancing_Machine" on Soul_Train
popularized the robot_dance.[43][44]
**** Move to Epic and Off the Wall (1975‚Äì1981) ****

The Jackson 5 left Motown in 1975, signing with Epic_Records and renaming
themselves the Jacksons.[45] Their younger brother Randy joined the band around
this time; Jermaine stayed with Motown and pursued a solo career.[46] The
Jacksons continued to tour internationally, and released six more albums
between 1976 and 1984. Michael, the group's main songwriter during this time,
wrote songs such as "Shake_Your_Body_(Down_to_the_Ground)" (1978), "This_Place
Hotel" (1980), and "Can_You_Feel_It" (1980).[47]
In 1977, Jackson moved to New York City to star as the Scarecrow in The_Wiz, a
musical film directed by Sidney_Lumet, alongside Diana_Ross, Nipsey_Russell,
and Ted Ross.[48] The film was a box-office failure.[49] Its score was arranged
by Quincy_Jones,[50] who later produced three of Jackson's solo albums.[51]
During his time in New York, Jackson frequented the Studio_54 nightclub, where
he heard early hip_hop; this influenced his beatboxing on future tracks such as
"Working_Day_and_Night".[52] In 1978, Jackson unsatisfied with his nose,
decided to have a rhinoplasty.[53] He was referred to Steven_Hoefflin, who
performed Jackson's operations.[54]
Jackson's fifth solo album, Off_the_Wall (1979), established him as a solo
performer and helped him move from the bubblegum pop of his youth to more
complex sounds.[38] It produced four top 10 entries in the US: "Off_the_Wall",
"She's_Out_of_My_Life", and the chart-topping singles "Don't_Stop_'Til_You_Get
Enough" and "Rock_with_You".[55] The album reached number three on the US
Billboard_200 and sold over 20¬†million copies worldwide.[56] In 1980, Jackson
won three American_Music_Awards for his solo work: Favorite Soul/R&B Album,
Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist, and Favorite Soul/R&B Single for "Don't Stop
'Til You Get Enough".[57][58] He also won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B
Vocal Performance for 1979 with "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough".[59] In 1981,
Jackson was the American Music Awards winner for Favorite Soul/R&B Album and
Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist.[60] Jackson felt Off the Wall should have made a
bigger impact, and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release.
[61] In 1980, he secured the highest royalty rate in the music industry: 37
percent of wholesale album profit.[62]
**** Thriller and Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever (1982‚Äì1983) ****
[A_sparkly_jacket_and_gloves,_displayed_inside_a_transparent_vertical_tube.]The
sequined jacket and white glove worn by Jackson at Motown_25:_Yesterday,_Today,
Forever. British_Vogue called Jackson "a fashion pioneer [...] who gave new
meaning to moonwalking, immortalised solitary, [and] sparkly gloves".[63]
Jackson recorded with Queen's lead singer Freddie_Mercury from 1981 to 1983,
recording demos of "State_of_Shock", "Victory" and "There_Must_Be_More_to_Life
Than_This". The recordings were intended for an album of duets but, according
to Queen's manager Jim_Beach, the relationship soured when Jackson brought a
llama into the recording studio,[64] and Jackson was upset by Mercury's drug
use.[65] "There Must Be More to Life Than This" was released in 2014.[66]
Jackson went on to record "State of Shock" with Mick_Jagger for the Jacksons'
album Victory (1984).[67]
In 1982, Jackson contributed "Someone in the Dark" to the audiobook_for_the
film_E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial. Jackson's sixth album, Thriller, was released
in late 1982. It was the bestselling album worldwide in 1983,[68][69] and
became the bestselling album of all time in the US[70] and the best-selling
album_of_all_time_worldwide, selling an estimated 70 million copies.[71][72] It
topped the Billboard 200 chart for 37 weeks and was in the top 10 of the 200
for 80 consecutive weeks. It was the first album to produce seven Billboard Hot
100 top-10 singles, including "Billie_Jean", "Beat_It", and "Wanna_Be_Startin'
Somethin'".[73]
On March 25, 1983, Jackson reunited with his brothers for Motown_25:_Yesterday,
Today,_Forever, an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16 to an
estimated audience of 47 million, and featured the Jacksons and other Motown
stars.[74] Jackson's solo performance of "Billie Jean" earned him his first
Emmy_Award nomination.[75] Wearing a glove decorated with rhinestones,[76] he
debuted his moonwalk_dance, which Jeffrey_Daniel had taught him three years
earlier, and it became his signature dance in his repertoire.[77] Jackson had
originally turned down the invitation to the show, believing he had been doing
too much television. But at the request of Motown founder Berry_Gordy, he
performed in exchange for an opportunity to do a solo performance.[78] Rolling
Stone reporter Mikal Gilmore called the performance "extraordinary".[38]
Jackson's performance drew comparisons to Elvis_Presley's and the_Beatles'
appearances on The_Ed_Sullivan_Show.[79] Anna_Kisselgoff of The New York Times
praised the perfect timing and technique involved in the dance.[80] Gordy
described being "mesmerized" by the performance.[81]
At the 26th_Annual_Grammy_Awards, Thriller won eight awards, and Jackson won an
award for the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook. Winning eight Grammys in
one ceremony is a record he holds with the band Santana.[59] Jackson and Quincy
Jones won the award for Producer of the Year (Non-Classical). Thriller won
Album of the Year (with Jackson as the album's artist and Jones as its co-
producer), and the single won Best Pop Vocal Performance (Male) award for
Jackson. "Beat It" won Record of the Year and Best Rock Vocal Performance
(Male). "Billie Jean" won two Grammy awards: Best R&B Song and Best R&B Vocal
Performance (Male), with Jackson as songwriter and singer respectively.[59]
Thriller won the Grammy for Best Engineered Recording (Non Classical),
acknowledging Bruce_Swedien for his work on the album.[82] At the 11th_Annual
American_Music_Awards, Jackson won another eight awards and became the youngest
artist to win the Award of Merit.[83] He also won Favorite Male Artist,
Favorite Soul/R&B Artist, and Favorite Pop/Rock Artist. "Beat It" won Favorite
Soul/R&B Video, Favorite Pop/Rock Video and Favorite Pop/Rock Single. The album
won Favorite Soul/R&B Album and Favorite Pop/Rock Album.[83][84] Thriller's
sales doubled after the release of an extended music video, Michael_Jackson's
Thriller, which sees Jackson dancing with a horde of zombies.[85][86]
The success transformed Jackson into a dominant force in global pop culture.
[86] Jackson had the highest royalty rate in the music industry at that point,
with about $2 for every album sold (equivalent to $6 in 2023), and was making
record-breaking profits. Dolls modeled after Jackson appeared in stores in May
1984 for $12 each.[87] In the same year, The Making of Michael Jackson's
Thriller, a documentary about the music video, won a Grammy for Best Music
Video (Longform).[59] Time described Jackson's influence at that point as "star
of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A
songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on
the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and
color too."[87] The New York Times wrote "in the world of pop music, there is
Michael Jackson and there is everybody else".[88]
**** Pepsi incident, "We Are the World" and other commercial activities
(1984‚Äì1985) ****
In November 1983, Jackson and his brothers partnered with PepsiCo in a
$5¬†million promotional deal that broke records for a celebrity endorsement
(equivalent to $15.3¬†million in 2023). The first Pepsi campaign, which ran in
the US from 1983 to 1984 and launched its "New Generation" theme, included tour
sponsorship, public relations events, and in-store displays. Jackson helped to
create the advertisement, and suggested using his song "Billie Jean", with
revised lyrics, as its jingle.[89]
On January 27, 1984, Michael and other members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi
commercial overseen by Phil_Dusenberry,[90] a BBDO ad agency executive, and
Alan_Pottasch, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at the Shrine_Auditorium in
Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans,
pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire, causing second-degree
burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his
third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter.[91]
Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5¬†million (equivalent to
$4.4¬†million in 2023) settlement to the Brotman_Medical_Center in Culver_City,
California; its now-closed Michael Jackson Burn Center was named in his honor.
[92][93] Jackson signed a second agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for
$10¬†million (equivalent to $26.8¬†million in 2023). The second campaign covered
20 countries and provided financial support for Jackson's Bad album and 1987‚Äì88
world tour. Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other
companies, such as LA_Gear, Suzuki, and Sony, but none were as significant as
his deals with Pepsi.[89]

The Victory_Tour of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson's new
solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he did
with his brothers.[94] Following controversy_over_the_concert's_ticket_sales,
Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated $3 to 5 million, to
charity.[95] During the last concert of the Victory Tour at the Dodger_Stadium
in Los Angeles, Jackson announced his split from the Jacksons during "Shake
Your Body".[96]
With Lionel_Richie, Jackson co-wrote the charity single "We_Are_the_World"
(1985), which raised money for the poor in the US and Africa.[97][98] It earned
$63¬†million (equivalent to $178¬†million in 2023),[98] and became one of the
best-selling_singles_of_all_time, with 20¬†million copies sold.[99] It won four
Grammy Awards in 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie.[97]
Jackson, Jones, and the promoter Ken Kragen received special awards for their
roles in the song's creation.[97][100][101][102]

Jackson collaborated with Paul_McCartney in the early 1980s, and learned that
McCartney was making $40¬†million a year from owning the rights to other
artists' songs.[98] By 1983, Jackson had begun buying publishing rights to
others' songs, but he was careful with his acquisitions, only bidding on a few
of the dozens that were offered to him. Jackson's early acquisitions of music
catalogs and song copyrights such as the Sly_Stone collection included
"Everyday People" (1968), Len_Barry's "1-2-3" (1965), and Dion_DiMucci's "The
Wanderer" (1961) and "Runaround_Sue" (1961).
In 1984, Robert_Holmes_√†_Court announced he was selling the ATV_Music
Publishing catalog comprising the publishing rights to nearly 4,000 songs,
including most of the Beatles' material.[103] In 1981, McCartney had been
offered the catalog for ¬£20¬†million ($40¬†million) (equivalent to $134¬†million
in 2023).[98][104] Jackson submitted a bid of $46¬†million (equivalent to
$135¬†million in 2023) on November 20, 1984.[103] When Jackson and McCartney
were unable to make a joint purchase, McCartney did not want to be the sole
owner of the Beatles' songs, and did not pursue an offer on his own.[105][104]
Jackson's agents were unable to come to a deal, and in May 1985 left talks
after having spent more than $1¬†million and four months of due_diligence work
on the negotiations.[103]
In June 1985, Jackson and Branca learned that Charles_Koppelman's and Marty
Bandier's The Entertainment Company had made a tentative offer to buy ATV Music
for $50¬†million; in early August, Holmes √† Court contacted Jackson and talks
resumed. Jackson's increased bid of $47.5¬†million (equivalent to $135¬†million
in 2023) was accepted because he could close the deal more quickly, having
already completed due diligence.[103] Jackson agreed to visit Holmes √† Court in
Australia, where he would appear on the Channel_Seven_Perth_Telethon.[106] His
purchase of ATV Music was finalized on August 10, 1985.[98][103]
**** Increased tabloid speculation (1986‚Äì1987) ****
See also: Health_and_appearance_of_Michael_Jackson
Jackson's skin had been medium-brown during his youth, but from the mid-1980s
gradually grew paler. The change drew widespread media coverage, including
speculation that he had been bleaching_his_skin.[107][108][109] His
dermatologist, Arnold_Klein, said he observed in 1983 that Jackson had
vitiligo,[110] a condition characterized by patches of the skin losing their
pigment. He also identified discoid_lupus_erythematosus in Jackson. He
diagnosed Jackson with lupus that year,[110] and with vitiligo in 1986.[111]
Vitiligo's drastic effects on the body can cause psychological distress.
Jackson used fair-colored makeup,[112] and possibly skin-bleaching prescription
creams,[113] to cover up the uneven blotches of color caused by the illness.
The creams would depigment the blotches, and, with the application of makeup,
he could appear very pale.[114] Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his
skin and could not control his vitiligo, adding, "When people make up stories
that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me."[115] He became friends with
Klein and Klein's assistant, Debbie_Rowe. Rowe later became Jackson's second
wife and the mother of his first two children.[116]
In his 1988 autobiography and a 1993 interview, Jackson said he had had two
rhinoplasty surgeries and a cleft_chin surgery but no more than that. He said
he lost weight in the early 1980s because of a change in diet to achieve a
dancer's body.[117] Witnesses reported that he was often dizzy, and speculated
he was suffering from anorexia_nervosa. Periods of weight loss became a
recurring problem later in his life.[118] After his death, Jackson's mother
said that he first turned to cosmetic_procedures to remedy his vitiligo,
because he did not want to look like a "spotted cow". She said he had received
more than the two cosmetic surgeries he claimed and speculated that he had
become addicted to them.[119]
In 1986, it was reported that Jackson slept in a hyperbaric_oxygen_chamber to
slow aging. He denied the story,[120] although it was alleged that Jackson
leaked an image of him sleeping in a glass chamber (according to Jackson, this
was a promotional shot from an upcoming_space_opera_featuring_himself) to The
National_Enquirer.[121] It was also reported that Jackson took female hormone
shots to keep his voice high and facial hair wispy, proposed to Elizabeth
Taylor and possibly had a shrine of her, and had cosmetic surgery on his eyes.
Jackson's manager Frank_DiLeo denied all of them, except for Jackson having a
chamber. DiLeo added "I don't know if he sleeps in it. I'm not for it. But
Michael thinks it's something that's probably healthy for him. He's a bit of a
health fanatic."[122]
When Jackson took his pet chimpanzee Bubbles to tour in Japan, the media
portrayed Jackson as an aspiring Disney cartoon character who befriended
animals.[123] It was also reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of
Joseph_Merrick (the "Elephant Man").[124] In June 1987, the Chicago_Tribune
reported Jackson's publicist bidding $1¬†million for the skeleton to the London
Hospital_Medical_College on his behalf. The college maintained the skeleton was
not for sale. DiLeo said Jackson had an "absorbing interest" in Merrick,
"purely based on his awareness of the ethical, medical and historical
significance."[125]
In September 1986, using the oxygen chamber story, the British tabloid The Sun
branded Jackson "Wacko Jacko", a name Jackson came to despise.[4][126] The
Atlantic noted that the name "Jacko" has racist connotations, as it originates
from Jacko_Macacco, a monkey used in monkey-baiting matches at the Westminster
Pit in the early 1820s, and "Jacko" was used in Cockney_slang to refer to
monkeys in general.[127]
Jackson worked with George_Lucas and Francis_Ford_Coppola on the 17-minute
$30¬†million 3D_film Captain_EO, which ran from 1986 at Disneyland and Epcot,
and later at Tokyo_Disneyland and Euro_Disneyland.[128] After having been
removed in the late 1990s, it returned to the theme park for several years
after Jackson's death.[129] In 1987, Ebony reported that Jackson had
disassociated himself from the Jehovah's Witnesses.[130] Katherine Jackson said
this might have been because some Witnesses strongly opposed the Thriller
video,[131] which Michael denounced in a Witness publication in 1984.[132] In
2001, Jackson told an interviewer he was still a Jehovah's Witness.[133]

had been honored by a president of the United States.
Jackson's first album in five years, Bad (1987), was highly anticipated, with
the industry expecting another major success.[134] It became the first album to
produce five US number-one singles: "I_Just_Can't_Stop_Loving_You", "Bad", "The
Way_You_Make_Me_Feel", "Man_in_the_Mirror", and "Dirty_Diana". Another song,
"Smooth_Criminal", peaked at number seven.[55] Bad won the 1988 Grammy for Best
Engineered Recording ‚Äì Non Classical and the 1990 Grammy_Award_for_Best_Music
Video, Short Form for "Leave_Me_Alone".[59][82] Jackson won an Award of
Achievement at the American Music Awards in 1989 after Bad generated five
number-one singles, became the first album to top the charts in 25 countries
and the bestselling album worldwide in 1987 and 1988.[135][136] By 2012, it had
sold between 30 and 45¬†million copies worldwide.[137][138]
The Bad_World_Tour ran from September 12, 1987, to January 27, 1989.[139] In
Japan, the tour had 14 sellouts and drew 570,000 people, nearly tripling the
previous record for a single tour.[140] The 504,000 people who attended seven
sold-out shows at Wembley_Stadium set a new Guinness_World_Record.[141]
In 1988, Jackson released his autobiography, Moonwalk, with input from Stephen
Davis and Jacqueline_Kennedy_Onassis.[142] It sold 200,000 copies,[143] and
reached the top of the New York Times bestsellers list.[144] Jackson discussed
his childhood, the Jackson 5, and the abuse from his father.[145] He attributed
his changing facial appearance to three plastic surgeries, puberty, weight
loss, a strict vegetarian diet, a change in hairstyle, and stage lighting.[146]
[117] In June, Jackson was honored with the Grand Vermeil Medal_of_the_City_of
Paris by the then Mayor of Paris Jacques_Chirac during his stay in the city as
part of the Bad_World_Tour.[147][148] On July 20, he became the first commoner
in history to enter London's Guildhall through the building's Royal Entrance.
[149] In October, Jackson released a film, Moonwalker, which featured live
footage and short films starring Jackson and Joe_Pesci. In the US it was
released direct-to-video and became the bestselling video cassette in the
country.[150][151] The Recording_Industry_Association_of_America (RIAA)
certified it as eight times Platinum in the US.[152]
In March 1988, Jackson purchased 2,700 acres (11¬†km2) of land near Santa_Ynez,
California, to build a new home, Neverland_Ranch, at a cost of $17¬†million
(equivalent to $44¬†million in 2023).[153] He installed a Ferris_wheel, a
carousel, a movie theater and a zoo.[153][154][155] A security staff of 40
patrolled the grounds.[154] Shortly afterwards, he appeared in the first
Western television advertisement in the Soviet_Union.[156]
Jackson became known as the "King_of_Pop", a nickname that Jackson's publicists
embraced.[18][157][158] When Elizabeth_Taylor presented him with the Soul Train
Heritage Award in 1989, she called him "the true king of pop, rock and soul."
[159] President George_H._W._Bush designated him the White House's "Artist of
the Decade".[160] At the 38th BMI_Awards in 1990, Jackson was the first person
to be honored with an award named after its recipient.[161] From 1985 to 1990,
Jackson donated $455,000 to the United_Negro_College_Fund,[162] and all profits
from his single "Man in the Mirror" went to charity.[163] His rendition of "You
Were There" at Sammy_Davis_Jr.'s 60th birthday celebration won Jackson a second
Emmy nomination.[75] Jackson was the bestselling artist of the 1980s.[164]
**** Dangerous and public social work (1991‚Äì1993) ****
In March 1991, Jackson renewed his contract with Sony for $65¬†million
(equivalent to $145¬†million in 2023), a record-breaking_deal,[165] beating Neil
Diamond's renewal contract with Columbia_Records.[166] In 1991, he released his
eighth album, Dangerous, co-produced with Teddy_Riley.[167] It was certified
eight times platinum in the US, and by 2018 had sold 32¬†million copies
worldwide.[168][169] In the US, the first single, "Black_or_White", was the
album's highest-charting song; it was number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for
seven weeks and achieved similar chart performances worldwide.[170] The second
single, "Remember_the_Time" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100
singles chart.[171] At the end of 1992, Dangerous was the bestselling album of
the year worldwide and "Black or White" the bestselling single of the year
worldwide at the Billboard_Music_Awards.[164] In 1993, he performed "Remember
the Time" at the Soul_Train_Music_Awards in a chair, saying he twisted his
ankle during dance rehearsals.[172] In the UK, "Heal_the_World" made No. 2 on
the charts in 1992.[173]
Jackson founded the Heal_the_World_Foundation in 1992. The charity brought
underprivileged children to Jackson's ranch to use the theme park rides, and
sent millions of dollars around the globe to help children threatened by war,
poverty, and disease. That July, Jackson published his second book, Dancing_the
Dream, a collection of poetry. The Dangerous_World_Tour ran between June 1992
and November 1993 and grossed $100 million (equivalent to $210¬†million in
2023); Jackson performed for over 3.5 million people in 70 concerts, all of
which were outside the US.[174][175] Part of the proceeds went to Heal the
World Foundation.[176] Jackson sold the broadcast rights of the tour to HBO for
$20¬†million, a record-breaking deal that still stands.[177]
Following the death of HIV/AIDS spokesperson and friend Ryan_White, Jackson
pleaded with the Clinton administration at Bill_Clinton's_inaugural_gala to
give more money to HIV/AIDS charities and research[178][179] and performed
"Gone_Too_Soon", a song dedicated to White, and "Heal the World" at the gala.
[180] Jackson visited Africa in early 1992; on his first stop in Gabon he was
greeted by more than 100,000 people, some of them carrying signs that read
"Welcome Home Michael",[181] and was awarded an Officer of the National_Order
of_Merit from President Omar_Bongo.[182][183] During his trip to Ivory Coast,
Jackson drew larger crowds than Pope_John_Paul_II on his previous visits.[184]
He was crowned "King Sani" by a tribal chief in the Ivorian village of
Krindjabo, where he thanked the dignitaries in French and English, signed
documents formalizing his kingship, and sat on a golden throne while presiding
over ceremonial dances.[181]
In January 1993, Jackson performed at the Super_Bowl_XXVII_halftime_show in
Pasadena, California. The NFL sought a big-name artist to keep ratings high
during halftime following dwindling audience figures.[185][186] With 133.4
million viewers, it was the first Super Bowl whose halftime show drew greater
audience figures than the game.[187] Jackson played "Jam", "Billie Jean",
"Black or White", and "Heal the World". Dangerous rose 90 places in the US
albums chart after the performance.[107]
Jackson gave a_90-minute_interview with Oprah_Winfrey on February 10, 1993. He
spoke of his childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had
missed out on much of his childhood, and said that he often cried from
loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of the
Elephant Man, slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and
stated for the first time that he had vitiligo. After the interview, Dangerous
re-entered the US albums chart in the top 10, more than a year after its
release.[18][107] The interview itself became the_most-watched_television
interview_in_United_States_history to date, with more than 90 million viewers.
[188]
In January 1993, Jackson won three American_Music_Awards: Favorite Pop/Rock
Album (Dangerous), Favorite Soul/R&B Single ("Remember the Time"), and was the
first to win the International Artist Award of Excellence.[189][190] In
February, he won the "Living Legend Award" at the 35th_Annual_Grammy_Awards in
Los Angeles.[59] He attended the award ceremony with Brooke_Shields.[191]
Dangerous was nominated for Best Vocal Performance (for "Black or White"), Best
R&B Vocal Performance ("Jam") and Best R&B Song ("Jam"), and Bruce Swedien and
Teddy Riley won the Grammy for Best Engineered ‚Äì Non Classical.[82]
**** First child sexual abuse accusations and first marriage (1993‚Äì1995) ****
Main article: 1993_Michael_Jackson_sexual_abuse_allegations
In August 1993, Jackson was accused of child_sexual_abuse by a 13-year-old boy,
Jordan Chandler, and his father, Evan Chandler.[192] Jordan said he and Jackson
had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation and oral_sex.[193] While Jordan's
mother initially told police that she did not believe Jackson had molested him,
her position wavered a few days later.[149][194] Evan was recorded discussing
his intention to pursue charges, which Jackson used to argue that he was the
victim of a jealous father trying to extort money.[194] Jackson's older sister
La Toya accused him of being a pedophile;[195] she later retracted this, saying
she had been forced into it by her abusive husband.[196]
Police raided Jackson's home in August and found two legal large-format art
books featuring young boys playing, running and swimming in various states of
undress.[197] Jackson denied knowing of the books' content and claimed if they
were there, someone had to have sent them to him and he did not open them.[198]
Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's genitals. A strip search
was made, and the jurors felt the description was not a match.[199][200][201]
In January 1994, Jackson settled with the Chandlers out of court for a reported
total sum of $23¬†million.[202] The police never pressed criminal charges.[203]
Citing a lack of evidence without Jordan's testimony, the state closed its
investigation on September 22, 1994.[204]
Jackson had been taking painkillers for his reconstructive scalp surgeries,
administered due to the Pepsi commercial accident in 1984, and became dependent
on them to cope with the stress of the sexual abuse allegations.[205] On
November 12, 1993, Jackson canceled the remainder of the Dangerous World Tour
due to health problems, stress from the allegations and painkiller addiction.
He thanked his close friend Elizabeth_Taylor for support, encouragement and
counsel. The end of the tour concluded his sponsorship deal with Pepsi.[206]
In late 1993, Jackson proposed to Lisa_Marie_Presley, the daughter of Elvis
Presley, over the phone.[207] They were married in La_Vega,_Dominican_Republic,
in May 1994 by civil judge Hugo Francisco √Ålvarez P√©rez.[208] The tabloid media
speculated that the wedding was a publicity stunt to deflect away from
Jackson's sexual abuse allegations and jump-start Presley's career as a singer.
[209][208] Their marriage ended little more than a year later, and they
separated in December 1995.[210] Presley cited "irreconcilable differences"
when filing for divorce the next month and only sought to reclaim her maiden
name as her settlement.[209][211] After the divorce, Judge P√©rez said, "They
lasted longer than I thought they would. I gave them a year. They lasted a year
and a half."[208] Presley later said she and Jackson had attempted to reconcile
intermittently for four years following their divorce, and that she had
traveled the world to be with him.[212]
Jackson composed music for the Sega_Genesis video game Sonic_the_Hedgehog_3
(1994), but left the project around the time the sexual abuse allegations
surfaced and went uncredited.[213][214] The Sega_Technical_Institute director
Roger Hector and the Sonic co-creator Naoto_Ohshima said that Jackson's
involvement was terminated and his music reworked following the allegations.
[215][216] However, Jackson's musical director Brad_Buxer and other members of
Jackson's team said Jackson went uncredited because he was unhappy with how the
Genesis replicated his music.[217]
**** HIStory, second marriage, fatherhood and Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory
in the Mix (1995‚Äì1997) ****
[Close-up_of_a_pale_skinned_Jackson_with_black_hair._He_is_wearing_a_black

the premiere of Michael_Jackson's_Ghosts
In June 1995, Jackson released the double album HIStory:_Past,_Present_and
Future,_Book_I. The first disc, HIStory Begins, is a greatest_hits_album
(reissued in 2001 as Greatest Hits: HIStory, Volume I). The second disc,
HIStory Continues, contains 13 original songs and two cover versions. The album
debuted at number one on the charts and has been certified for eight million
shipments in the US.[218] It is the bestselling multi-disc album of all time,
with 20¬†million copies (40¬†million units) sold worldwide.[170][219] HIStory
received a Grammy nomination for Album_of_the_Year.[59] The New York Times
reviewed it as "the testimony of a musician whose self-pity now equals his
talent".[220]
The first single from HIStory was "Scream/Childhood". "Scream", a duet with
Jackson's youngest sister Janet, protests the media's treatment of Jackson
during the 1993 child abuse allegations against him. The single reached number
five on the Billboard Hot 100,[171] and received a Grammy nomination for "Best
Pop Collaboration with Vocals".[59] The second single, "You_Are_Not_Alone",
holds the Guinness world record for the first song to debut at number one on
the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[221] It received a Grammy nomination for "Best Pop
Vocal Performance" in 1995.[59]
In 1995 the Anti-Defamation_League and other groups complained that "Jew me,
sue me, everybody do me/ Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me", the
original lyrics of "They_Don't_Care_About_Us", were antisemitic. Jackson
released a revised version of the song.[222]
In late 1995, Jackson was admitted to a hospital after collapsing during
rehearsals for a televised performance, caused by a stress-related panic
attack.[223] In November, Jackson merged his ATV Music catalog with Sony's
music publishing division, creating Sony/ATV_Music_Publishing. He retained
ownership of half the company, earning $95¬†million up front (equivalent to
$190¬†million in 2023) as well as the rights_to_more_songs.[224][225]
"Earth_Song" was the third single released from HIStory, and topped the UK
Singles_Chart for six weeks over Christmas 1995.[173] It became the 87th-
bestselling single in the UK.[226] At the 1996_Brit_Awards, Jackson's
performance of "Earth Song" was disrupted by Pulp singer Jarvis_Cocker, who was
protesting what Cocker saw as Jackson's "Christ-like" persona. Jackson said the
stage invasion was "disgusting and cowardly".[227][228]
In 1996, Jackson won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form, for "Scream"
and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist.[59][229] In July
1996, Jackson performed for Sultan_Hassanal_Bolkiah's fiftieth birthday at
Jerudong_Park_Amphitheater, which was specifically built for that birthday
concert.[230] Jackson was reportedly paid $17¬†million (equivalent to
$33¬†million in 2023).[231] Jackson promoted HIStory with the HIStory_World
Tour, from September 7, 1996, to October 15, 1997. He performed 82 concerts in
five continents, 35 countries and 58 cities to over 4.5¬†million fans, his most
attended tour. It grossed $165 million.[139] During the tour, in Sydney,
Australia, Jackson married Debbie_Rowe, a dermatology assistant, who was six
months pregnant with his first child.[232]
Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. (commonly known as Prince) was born on February 13,
1997. His sister Paris-Michael_Katherine_Jackson was born on April 3, 1998.
[233] Jackson and Rowe divorced in 2000, Rowe conceded custody of the children,
with an $8¬†million settlement (equivalent to $14.6¬†million in 2023).[234] In
2004, after the second_child_abuse_allegations_against_Jackson, she returned to
court to reclaim custody. The suit was settled in 2006.[235]
In 1997, Jackson released Blood_on_the_Dance_Floor:_HIStory_in_the_Mix, which
contained remixes of singles from HIStory and five new songs. Worldwide sales
stand at 6 million copies, making it the best-selling_remix_album. It reached
number one in the UK, as did the single "Blood_on_the_Dance_Floor".[236] In the
US, the album reached number 24 and was certified platinum.[168]
**** Label dispute and Invincible (1997‚Äì2002) ****
From October 1997 to September 2001, Jackson worked on his tenth solo album,
Invincible, which cost $30 million (equivalent to $51.6¬†million in 2023) to
record, making it the most_expensive_album of all time.[237] In June 1999,
Jackson joined Luciano_Pavarotti for a War_Child benefit concert in Modena,
Italy. The show raised a million dollars for refugees of the Kosovo_War, and
additional funds for the children of Guatemala.[238] Later that month, Jackson
organized a series of "Michael_Jackson_&_Friends" benefit concerts in Germany
and Korea. Other artists involved included Slash, The_Scorpions, Boyz_II_Men,
Luther_Vandross, Mariah_Carey, A._R._Rahman, Prabhu_Deva Sundaram, Shobana,
Andrea_Bocelli and Luciano Pavarotti. The proceeds went to the Nelson_Mandela
Children's_Fund, the Red_Cross and UNESCO.[239] In 1999, Jackson was presented
with the "Outstanding Humanitarian Award" at Bollywood_Movie_Awards in New York
City where he noted Mahatma_Gandhi to have been an inspiration for him.[240]
[241] From August 1999 to 2000, he lived in New York City at 4 East_74th
Street.[242] At the turn of the century, Jackson was awarded with the Artist of
the 1980s Decade Award at the 27th_American_Music_Awards,[243] and the Best-
Selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium Award at the 12nd World_Music_Awards.
[244] In 2000, Guinness_World_Records recognized him for supporting 39
charities, more than any other entertainer.[245]
In September 2001, two_concerts were held at Madison Square Garden to mark
Jackson's 30th year as a solo artist. Jackson performed with his brothers for
the first time since 1984. The show also featured M√Ωa, Usher, Whitney_Houston,
Destiny's_Child, Monica, Liza_Minnelli and Slash. The first show was marred by
technical lapses, and the crowd booed a speech by Marlon_Brando.[246]
45¬†million people watched the television broadcast of the shows in November
according to Nielsen_Media_Research.[247] After the September_11_attacks (in
which Jackson narrowly avoided death by oversleeping and missing a scheduled
meeting at the World_Trade_Center[248]), Jackson helped organize the United_We
Stand:_What_More_Can_I_Give benefit concert at Robert_F._Kennedy_Memorial
Stadium in Washington, D.C., on October 21, 2001. Jackson performed "What_More
Can_I_Give" as the finale.[249]
The release of Invincible was preceded by a dispute between Jackson and his
record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had expected the licenses to
the masters of his albums to revert to him in the early 2000s, after which he
would be able to promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits,
but clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson
sought an early exit from his contract.[250] Invincible was released on October
30, 2001. It was Jackson's first full-length album in six years, and the last
album of original material he released in his lifetime.[250] It debuted at
number one in 13 countries, and went on to sell eight¬†million copies worldwide,
receiving double-platinum certification in the US.[168][251][252]
On January 9, 2002, Jackson won his 22nd American Music Award for Artist of the
Century.[253][254] Later that year, an anonymous surrogate_mother gave birth to
his third child, Prince Michael Jackson II (nicknamed "Blanket"[nb_3]), who had
been conceived by artificial_insemination.[255] On November 20, Jackson briefly
held Blanket over the railing of his Berlin hotel room, four stories above
ground level, prompting widespread criticism in the media. Jackson apologized
for the incident, calling it "a terrible mistake".[256] On January 22, promoter
Marcel Avram filed a breach of contract complaint against Jackson for failing
to perform two planned 1999 concerts.[257] In March, a Santa Maria jury ordered
Jackson to pay Avram $5.3¬†million.[258][259] On December 18, 2003, Jackson's
attorneys dropped all appeals on the verdict and settled the lawsuit for an
undisclosed amount.[260]
On April 24, 2002, Jackson performed at Apollo_Theater. The concert was a
fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and former President Bill
Clinton.[261] The money collected would be used to encourage citizens to vote.
It raised $2.5¬†million.[262] The concert was called Michael_Jackson:_Live_at
the_Apollo and was one of Jackson's final on-stage performances.[263]
In July 2002, at Al_Sharpton's National_Action_Network in Harlem, Jackson
called the Sony Music chairman Tommy_Mottola "a racist, and very, very, very
devilish", and accused him of exploiting black artists for his own gain. The
accusation prompted Sharpton to form a coalition investigating whether Mottola
exploited black artists.[264] Jackson charged that Mottola had called his
colleague Irv_Gotti a "fat nigger".[265] Sony issued a statement calling the
accusations "ludicrous, spiteful, and hurtful" and said Mottola had championed
Jackson's career for years.[264] Sony refused to renew Jackson's contract and
said that a $25 million promotional campaign had failed because Jackson refused
to tour in the US for Invincible.[237]

Beginning in May 2002, a documentary film crew led by Martin_Bashir followed
Jackson for several months.[256] The documentary, broadcast in February 2003 as
Living_with_Michael_Jackson, showed Jackson holding hands and discussing
sleeping arrangements with a twelve-year-old boy.[17][266] He said that he saw
nothing wrong with having sleepovers with minors and sharing his bed and
bedroom with various people, which aroused controversy. He insisted that the
sleepovers were not sexual and that his words had been misunderstood.[267][268]
In October 2003, Jackson received the Key_to_the_City of Las_Vegas from Mayor
Oscar_Goodman.[269] On November 18, 2003, Sony released Number_Ones, a greatest
hits_compilation. It was certified five times platinum by the RIAA, and ten
times platinum in the UK, for shipments of at least 3¬†million units.[168][270]
On December 18, 2003, Santa Barbara authorities charged Jackson with seven
counts of child molestation and two counts of intoxicating a minor with
alcoholic_drinks.[271] Jackson denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty.
[272] The People_v._Jackson trial began on January 31, 2005, in Santa_Maria,
California, and lasted until the end of May. Jackson found the experience
stressful and it affected his health. If convicted, he would have faced up to
twenty years in prison.[273] On June 13, 2005, Jackson was acquitted on all
counts.[274] FBI_files_on_Jackson, released in 2009, revealed the FBI's role in
the 2005 trial and the 1993 allegations, and showed that the FBI found no
evidence of criminal conduct on Jackson's behalf.[275][276]

After the trial, Jackson became reclusive.[277] In June 2005, he moved to
Bahrain as a guest of Sheikh_Abdullah.[278] In early 2006, it was announced
that Jackson had signed a contract with a Bahrain startup, Two Seas Records.
Nothing came of the deal, and the Two Seas CEO, Guy_Holmes, later said it was
never finalized.[279][280] Holmes also found that Jackson was on the verge of
bankruptcy and was involved in 47 ongoing lawsuits.[278] By September 2006,
Jackson was no longer affiliated with Two Seas.[280]
In April 2006, Jackson agreed to use a piece of his ATV catalog stake, then
worth about $1¬†billion, as collateral against his $270¬†million worth of loans
from Bank_of_America. Bank of America had sold the loans to Fortress
Investments, an investment company that buys distressed loans, the year before.
As part of the agreement, Fortress Investments provided Jackson a new loan of
$300¬†million with reduced interest payments (equivalent to $450¬†million in
2023). Sony Music would have the option to buy half of his stake, or about 25%
of the catalog, at a set price. Jackson's financial managers had urged him to
shed part of his stake to avoid bankruptcy.[225][281] The main house at
Neverland Ranch was closed as a cost-cutting measure, while Jackson lived in
Bahrain at the hospitality of Abdullah.[282] At least thirty of Jackson's
employees had not been paid on time and were owed $306,000 in back wages.
Jackson was ordered to pay $100,000 in penalties.[225] Jackson never returned
to Neverland after his acquittal.[283]
In mid-2006, Jackson moved to Grouse_Lodge, a residential recording studio near
Rosemount,_County_Westmeath, Ireland. There, he began work on a new album with
the American producers will.i.am and Rodney_Jenkins.[284] That November,
Jackson invited an Access_Hollywood camera crew into the studio in Westmeath.
[170] On November 15, Jackson briefly joined in on a performance of "We Are the
World" at the World_Music_Awards in London, his last public performance, and
accepted the Diamond Award for sales of 100 million records.[170][285] He
returned to the US in December, settling in Las Vegas. That month, he attended
James_Brown's funeral in Augusta,_Georgia, where he gave a eulogy calling Brown
his greatest inspiration.[286]

In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought another music publishing company, Famous_Music
LLC, formerly owned by Viacom. The deal gave Jackson the rights to songs by
Eminem and Beck, among others.[287][288] In a brief interview, Jackson said he
had no regrets about his career despite his problems and "deliberate attempts
to hurt [him]".[289] That March, Jackson visited a US Army post in Japan, Camp
Zama, to greet more than 3,000 troops and their families.[290][291] As of
September, Jackson was still working on his next album, which he never
completed.[292]
In 2008, for the 25th anniversary of Thriller, Jackson and Sony released
Thriller_25, with two remixes released as singles: "The_Girl_Is_Mine_2008" and
"Wanna_Be_Startin'_Somethin'_2008".[293] For Jackson's 50th birthday, Sony BMG
released a series of greatest hits albums, King_of_Pop, with different
tracklists for different regions.[294] That July, Fortress Investments
threatened to foreclose on Neverland Ranch, which Jackson had used as
collateral for his loans. Fortress sold Jackson's debts to Colony_Capital LLC.
[295][296] In November, Jackson transferred Neverland Ranch's title to Sycamore
Valley Ranch Company LLC, a joint venture between Jackson and Colony Capital
LLC. The deal earned him $35 million.[297] In 2009, Jackson arranged to sell a
collection of his memorabilia of more than 1,000 items through Julien's_Auction
House, but canceled the auction in April.[298]
In March 2009, amid speculation about his finances and health, Jackson
announced a series of comeback concerts, This_Is_It, at a press conference at
the_O2_Arena.[299] The shows were to be his first major concerts since the
HIStory World Tour in 1997. Jackson suggested he would retire after the shows.
The initial plan was for ten concerts in London, followed by shows in Paris,
New York City and Mumbai. Randy Phillips, the president and chief executive of
AEG_Live, predicted the first ten dates would earn Jackson ¬£50¬†million.[300]
The London residency was increased to fifty dates after record-breaking ticket
sales; more than one million were sold in less than two hours.[301] The
concerts were to run from July 13, 2009, to March 6, 2010. Jackson moved to Los
Angeles, where he rehearsed in the weeks leading up to the tour under the
direction of the choreographer Kenny_Ortega, whom he had worked with during his
previous tours. Rehearsals took place at the_Forum and the Staples_Center owned
by AEG.[302] By this point, Jackson's debt had grown to almost $500 million. By
the time of his death, he was three or four months behind payments on his home
in San Fernando Valley.[303][304] The_Independent reported that Jackson planned
a string of further ventures designed to recoup his debts, including a world
tour, a new album, films, a museum and a casino.[299]

On June 25, 2009, less than three weeks before his concert residency was due to
begin in London, with all concerts sold out, Jackson died from cardiac arrest,
caused by a propofol and benzodiazepine overdose.[305][306] Conrad_Murray, his
personal physician, had given Jackson various medications to help him sleep at
his rented mansion in Holmby_Hills,_Los_Angeles. Paramedics received a 911 call
at 12:21¬†pm Pacific_time (19:21 UTC) and arrived at the property four minutes
later.[307] Jackson was not breathing and CPR was performed.[308] Resuscitation
efforts continued en route to Ronald_Reagan_UCLA_Medical_Center, and for more
than an hour after Jackson's arrival there, but were unsuccessful,[309][310]
and Jackson was pronounced dead at 2:26¬†pm Pacific time (21:26 UTC).[311][312]
Murray had administered propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam;[313] Jackson's
death was caused by a propofol overdose.[306][310]
News of his death spread quickly online, causing websites to slow down and
crash from user overload,[314] and it put unprecedented strain[315] on many
services and websites including Google,[316] AOL_Instant_Messenger,[315]
Twitter and Wikipedia.[316] Overall, web_traffic rose by between 11% and 20%.
[317][318] MTV and BET aired marathons of Jackson's music videos,[319] and
Jackson specials aired on television stations around the world.[320] MTV
briefly returned to its original music video format,[5] and they aired hours of
Jackson's music videos, with live news specials featuring reactions from MTV
personalities and other celebrities.[321]

Fans visiting the makeshift memorial set up outside the Neverland Ranch
entrance shortly after Jackson's death
Jackson's memorial was held on July 7, 2009, at the Staples_Center in Los
Angeles, preceded by a private family service at Forest_Lawn_Memorial_Park's
Hall_of_Liberty. Over 1.6¬†million fans applied for tickets to the memorial; the
8,750 recipients were drawn at random, and each received two tickets.[322] The
memorial service was one of the most watched events in streaming history,[323]
with an estimated US audience of 31.1¬†million[324] and a worldwide audience of
an estimated 2.5 to 3 billion.[325][326]
Mariah_Carey, Stevie_Wonder, Lionel_Richie, Jennifer_Hudson, and Shaheen
Jafargholi performed at the memorial, and Smokey_Robinson and Queen_Latifah
gave eulogies.[327] Al_Sharpton received a standing ovation with cheers when he
told Jackson's children: "Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. It was
strange what your daddy had to deal with. But he dealt with it anyway."[328]
Jackson's 11-year-old daughter Paris_Katherine, speaking publicly for the first
time, wept as she addressed the crowd.[329][330] Lucious Smith provided a
closing prayer.[331] On September 3, 2009, the body of Jackson was entombed at
Forest_Lawn_Memorial_Park in Glendale,_California.[332]
**** Criminal investigation and prosecution of Conrad Murray ****
Main article: People_v._Murray
In August 2009, the Los_Angeles_County_Coroner ruled that Jackson's death was a
homicide.[333][334] Law enforcement officials charged_Murray with involuntary
manslaughter on February 8, 2010.[335] In late 2011, he was found guilty of
involuntary manslaughter[336] and held without bail to await sentencing.[337]
Murray was sentenced to four years in prison, but was released after one year
and eleven months.[338]
**** Posthumous sales ****
At the 2009_American_Music_Awards, Jackson won four posthumous awards,
including two for his compilation album Number_Ones, bringing his total
American Music Awards to 26.[339][340] In the year after his death, more than
16.1¬†million copies of Jackson's albums were sold in the US alone, and
35¬†million copies were sold worldwide, more than any other artist in 2009.[341]
[342] He became the first artist to sell one million music_downloads in a week,
with 2.6¬†million song downloads. Thriller, Number Ones and The_Essential
Michael_Jackson became the first catalog albums to outsell any new album.[343]
Jackson also became the first artist to have four of the top-20 bestselling
albums in a single year in the US.[344] Within the year following his death,
Jackson sold over 75 million records worldwide.[345] By the end of 2013,
Jackson had sold over 50 million albums worldwide since his death.[346]
Following the surge in sales, in March 2010, Sony Music signed a $250¬†million
deal (equivalent to $350¬†million in 2023) with the Jackson_estate to extend
their distribution rights to Jackson's back catalog until at least 2017; it had
been due to expire in 2015. It was the most_expensive_music_contract for a
single artist in history.[347][348] They agreed to release ten albums of
previously unreleased material and new collections of released work.[347][349]
The deal was extended in 2017.[350] That July, a Los Angeles court awarded
Quincy_Jones $9.4¬†million of disputed royalty payments for Off the Wall,
Thriller, and Bad.[51] In July 2018, Sony/ATV bought the estate's stake in EMI
for $287.5¬†million.[351]
In 2014, Jackson became the first artist to have a top-ten single in the
Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades.[352] The following year, Thriller
became the first album to be certified for 30¬†million shipments by the
Recording_Industry_Association_of_America (RIAA).[353] A year later, it was
certified 33√ó platinum after Soundscan added streams and audio downloads to
album certifications.[354][nb_4]
In February 2024, Sony Music acquired half of Jackson's publishing rights and
recording masters for an estimated $600¬†million. The deal includes assets from
Jackson's Mijac publishing catalog, but excludes royalties from several
Jackson-related productions, including the MJ Broadway musical and the Michael
biopic. The deal is possibly the largest transaction ever for a single
musician's work.[356][357]
**** Posthumous releases and productions ****
Jackson's posthumous releases and productions are administered by the estate_of
Michael_Jackson, which owns Jackson's trademarks and rights to his name, image
and likeness.[358] The first posthumous Jackson song, "This_Is_It", co-written
in the 1980s with Paul_Anka, was released in October 2009. The surviving
Jackson brothers reunited to record backing vocals.[359] It was followed by a
documentary film about the rehearsals for the canceled This Is It tour, Michael
Jackson's_This_Is_It,[360] and a_compilation_album.[361] Despite a limited two-
week engagement, the film became the highest-grossing documentary or concert
film ever, with earnings of more than $260 million worldwide.[362] Jackson's
estate received 90% of the profits.[363] In late 2010, Sony released the first
posthumous album, Michael, and the lead single "Hold_My_Hand", a duet with
Akon. The Jackson collaborator will.i.am expressed disgust, saying that Jackson
would not have approved the release.[364]
The video game developer Ubisoft released a music_game featuring Jackson for
the 2010 holiday season, Michael_Jackson:_The_Experience. It was among the
first games to use Kinect and PlayStation_Move, the motion-detecting camera
systems for Xbox_360 and PlayStation_3.[365] In April 2011, Mohamed_Al-Fayed,
the chairman of Fulham_Football_Club, unveiled a statue_of_Jackson outside the
club stadium, Craven_Cottage.[366] It was moved to the National_Football_Museum
in Manchester in May 2014,[367] and removed from display in March 2019
following renewed sexual assault allegations.[368]
In October 2011, the theater company Cirque_du_Soleil launched Michael_Jackson:
The_Immortal_World_Tour, a $57-million production,[369] in Montreal, with a
permanent show resident in Las Vegas.[370] A larger and more theatrical Cirque
show, Michael_Jackson:_One, designed for residency at the Mandalay_Bay resort
in Las Vegas, opened on May 23, 2013, in a renovated theater.[371][372]
In 2012, in an attempt to end a family dispute, Jackson's brother Jermaine
retracted his signature on a public letter criticizing executors of Jackson's
estate and his mother's advisors over the legitimacy of his brother's will.
[373] T.J. Jackson, the son of Tito Jackson, was given co-guardianship of
Michael Jackson's children after false reports of Katherine Jackson going
missing.[374] Xscape, an album of unreleased material, was released on May 13,
2014.[375] The lead single, a duet between Jackson and Justin_Timberlake, "Love
Never_Felt_So_Good", reached number 9 on the US Billboard Hot 100, making
Jackson the first artist to have a top-10 single on the chart in five different
decades.[376]
Later in 2014, Queen released a duet recorded with Jackson in the 1980s.[66] A
compilation album, Scream, was released on September 29, 2017.[377] A jukebox
musical, MJ_the_Musical, premiered on Broadway in 2022.[378] Myles_Frost won
the 2022 Tony_Award_for_Best_Actor_in_a_Musical for his portrayal of Jackson.
[379] On November 18, 2022, Epic released a 40th-anniversary_edition_reissue_of
Thriller.[380][381] A biographical film based on Jackson's life, Michael,
directed by Antoine_Fuqua, is scheduled for April 2025.[382] Jackson is played
by his nephew Jaafar_Jackson. Deadline_Hollywood reported that the film "will
not shy away from the controversies of Jackson's life".[383] Since Jackson's
death his estate has grossed $2 billion in ticket revenue from MJ_the_Musical,
Michael_Jackson's_This_Is_It and two Cirque_du_Soleil productions.[384]
**** Posthumous child sexual abuse allegations ****
[A_smiling_Jackson_wears_a_blue_baseball_cap_and_a_red_shirt._On_his_left,_a
young_boy_smiles._He_is_dressed_in_a_red_shirt,_too.]Jackson and Safechuck in
Honolulu, Hawaii in 1988
In 2013, choreographer Wade_Robson filed a lawsuit alleging that Jackson had
sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old
(1989‚Äì1996).[385] In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck, alleging
similar sexual abuse over a four-year period starting when Safechuck was ten
(1988‚Äì1992).[386][387][388] Both had previously testified in Jackson's defense
during the 1993 allegations; Robson did so again in 2005.[389][390] In 2015,
Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed as it had been filed too
late. Safechuck's claim was also time-barred.[391]
In 2017, it was ruled that Jackson's corporations could not be held accountable
for his alleged past actions.[392][393] The rulings were appealed. On October
20, 2020, Safechuck's lawsuit against Jackson's corporations was again
dismissed. The judge ruled that there was no evidence that Safechuck had had a
relationship with Jackson's corporation, nor was it proven that there was a
special relationship between the two.[394][395][396][397] On April 26, 2021,
Robson's case was dismissed because of a lack of supporting evidence that the
defendants exercised control over Jackson.[398]
Robson and Safechuck's allegations were the subject of the documentary film
Leaving_Neverland, released in March 2019.[399] Radio stations in New Zealand,
Canada, the UK and the Netherlands removed Jackson's music from their
playlists.[400][401][402] Jackson's family condemned the film as a "public
lynching",[403] and the Jackson estate released a statement calling the film a
"tabloid character assassination [Jackson] endured in life, and now in death".
[404] Close associates of Jackson, such as Corey_Feldman, Aaron_Carter, Brett
Barnes, and Macaulay_Culkin, defended Jackson in the wake of the documentary's
release, saying that Jackson had never molested them.[405][406][407]
Documentaries such as Square_One:_Michael_Jackson, Neverland_Firsthand:
Investigating_the_Michael_Jackson_Documentary and Michael_Jackson:_Chase_the
Truth, presented information countering the claims suggested by Leaving
Neverland.[408][409][410] Jackson's album sales increased following the
documentary screenings.[411] Billboard senior editor Gail Mitchell said she and
a colleague interviewed about thirty music executives who believed Jackson's
legacy could withstand the controversy.[412] In late 2019, some New Zealand and
Canadian radio stations re-added Jackson's music to their playlists, citing
"positive listener survey results".[413][414]
On February 21, 2019, the Jackson estate sued HBO for breaching a non-
disparagement clause from a 1992 contract. The suit sought to compel HBO to
participate in a non-confidential arbitration that could result in $100¬†million
or more in damages awarded to the estate.[415] HBO said they did not breach a
contract and filed an anti-SLAPP motion against the estate. In September 2019,
Judge George_H._Wu denied HBO's motion to dismiss the case, allowing the
Jackson estate to arbitrate.[416] HBO appealed, but in December 2020 the
appeals court affirmed Wu's ruling.[417]
In 2020, a state law passed in California which granted plaintiffs in child sex
abuse cases an additional period to file lawsuits. In October 2020 and again in
April 2021, the Los_Angeles_County_Superior_Court ruled that MJJ Productions
Inc. and MJJ Ventures Inc. employees were not legally obligated to protect the
two men from Jackson. In August 2023, California's Second District Court of
Appeal overturned the ruling, and the case was approved to move forward to
trial_court.[418]

Main article: Cultural_impact_of_Michael_Jackson
See also: List_of_Michael_Jackson_records_and_achievements
Jackson has been referred to as the "King_of_Pop" for having transformed the
art of music videos and paving the way for modern pop music. For much of
Jackson's career, he had an unparalleled worldwide influence over the younger
generation.[419] His influence extended beyond the music industry; he impacted
dance, led fashion trends, and raised awareness for global affairs.[420]
Jackson's music and videos fostered racial diversity in MTV's roster and
steered its focus from rock to pop music and R&B, leading to the
discontinuation of the album-oriented_rock format previously dominant on the
channel.[38][421]
Michael Jackson's meteoric rise in the 1980s catapulted him to global stardom,
and his influence transcended borders. In Africa, his influence was compared to
Nelson Mandela for his ability to inspire and unite diverse audiences through
his music.[422][423] Similarly, in India, Jackson was likened to Mahatma
Gandhi, with his art championing themes of social justice and humanitarianism,
[424] and his influence extending to Bollywood where it was said that anyone
who danced well was compared to Michael Jackson.[422] In Europe, Jackson's
impact was compared to that of the Pope, drawing huge crowds of people who
gathered to see the singer in public and even more to his concerts, which
spread messages of love and healing during rough economic and political times.
[425] His presence in the Middle East was considered as widespread as Coca-
Cola, symbolizing a shared global culture through his music.[426] Additionally,
Jackson is considered the backbone of the K-Pop industry in South Korea,
influencing countless artists and shaping the genre's development.[427][428]
In songs such as "Black_or_White", "Heal_the_World", "Earth_Song" and "They
Don't_Care_About_Us", Jackson's music emphasized racial_integration and
environmentalism and protested injustice.[429][430] He is recognized as the
Most Successful Entertainer of All Time by Guinness_World_Records.[431][432]
Jackson has also appeared on Rolling_Stone's lists of the Greatest Singers of
All Time.[433][434] He is considered one of the most significant cultural
figures of the 20th century,[435] and his contributions to music, dance, and
fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in
popular culture for over four decades.[436][437][438]
     Trying to trace Michael Jackson's influence on the pop stars that
     followed him is like trying to trace the influence of oxygen and
     gravity. So vast, far-reaching and was his impact‚Äîparticularly in the
     wake of Thriller's colossal and heretofore unmatched commercial
     success‚Äîthat there weren't a whole lot of artists who weren't trying
     to mimic some of the Jackson formula.
     ‚Äî‚ÄäJ. Edward Keyes of Rolling_Stone[439]
Danyel_Smith, chief content officer of Vibe Media Group and the editor-in-chief
of Vibe, described Jackson as "the greatest star".[440] Steve Huey of AllMusic
called him "an unstoppable juggernaut, possessed of all the skills to dominate
the charts seemingly at will: an instantly identifiable voice, eye-popping
dance moves, stunning musical versatility and loads of sheer star power".[4]
BET said Jackson was "quite simply the greatest entertainer of all time" whose
"sound, style, movement and legacy continues to inspire artists of all genres".
[441]

In 1984, Time pop critic Jay_Cocks wrote that "Jackson is the biggest thing
since the Beatles. He is the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley. He
just may be the most popular black singer ever." He described Jackson as a
"star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music
business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the
fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste
and style, and color too."[87] In 2003, The_Daily_Telegraph writer Tom_Utley
described Jackson as "extremely important" and a "genius".[442] At Jackson's
memorial service on July 7, 2009, Motown founder Berry Gordy called Jackson
"the greatest entertainer that ever lived".[443][444] In a June 28, 2009
Baltimore_Sun article, Jill Rosen wrote that Jackson's legacy influenced fields
including sound, dance, fashion, music videos and celebrity.[445]
In 2018, the National_Portrait_Gallery named Michael Jackson the most depicted
cultural figure of the century,[446] later stating that Jackson's influence on
art rivaled that of Jesus_Christ.[447] Nicholas_Cullinan, director of the
National Portrait Gallery and curator of the Michael_Jackson:_On_the_Wall
exhibition, described Jackson's impact on art as unprecedented and claimed in
2018 that Jackson was the most depicted figure in the history of contemporary
art.[448]
Craig Glenday, the Editor-in-Chief of Guinness_World_Records, called Jackson
the most famous person in the world in 2006. Following Jackson's passing,
Glenday wrote in an obituary that Jackson had maintained this status up until
his death,[449] later remarking that his fame had exceeded that of Confucius.
[450]
In 2014, a comprehensive study conducted by researcher Young-Ho Eom at the
University_of_Toulouse identified Michael Jackson as one of the most
influential people of all time.[451] The study utilized advanced ranking
methods, including 2D Rank and PageRank algorithms, to analyze the impact of
historical figures. Jackson was prominently placed on the list of top
influencers, alongside Swedish botanist Carl_Linnaeus, Adolf_Hitler, and Jesus
Christ. An additional study conducted in 2013 also identified Michael Jackson
as one of the most influential people of all time. This study ranked Jackson at
the top of the list, alongside Napoleon_Bonaparte, highlighting the
extraordinary influence and global recognition that Jackson achieved throughout
his career. [452]
Following Jackson's death, The_Guardian wrote that he was in a league of his
own in terms of fame, noting that Jackson had become so famous that the number
of people who might not know who he was had become statistically insignificant.
[453] Due to his unprecedented influence, Michael Jackson is recognized today
as one of the most globally renowned figures in history. Reports of his fame
extend from the Middle East,[454][455] Africa,[422][456] India,[457][458] and
China [459][460] to tribes in the Amazon.[461] His influence even reaches
remote corners of the world such as S√£o_Tom√©_and_Pr√≠ncipe,or Tristan_da_Cunha,
where tribute artists keep his legacy alive by celebrating his music. [462]
[463]
***** Philanthropy and humanitarian work *****
Main article: Philanthropy_of_Michael_Jackson
President_Ronald_Reagan rewarding Jackson in 1984 for his support of alcohol
and drug abuse charities
Jackson is widely regarded as having been a prolific philanthropist and
humanitarian.[464][465][466][467] Jackson's early charitable work has been
described by The_Chronicle_of_Philanthropy as having "paved the way for the
current surge in celebrity philanthropy",[468] and by the Los_Angeles_Times as
having "set the standard for generosity for other entertainers".[464]
By some estimates, he donated over $500¬†million, not accounting for inflation,
to various charities over the course of his life.[464] In 1992, Jackson
established his Heal_the_World_Foundation, to which he donated several million
dollars in revenue from his Dangerous_World_Tour.[469]
Jackson's philanthropic activities went beyond just monetary donations. He also
performed at benefit_concerts, some of which he arranged. He gifted tickets for
his regular concert performances to groups that assist underprivileged
children. He visited sick children in hospitals around the world. He opened his
own home for visits by underprivileged or sick children and provided special
facilities and nurses if the children needed that level of care.[citation
needed]
Jackson donated valuable, personal and professional paraphernalia for numerous
charity auctions. He received various awards and accolades for his
philanthropic work, including two bestowed by presidents_of_the_United_States.
The vast breadth of Jackson's philanthropic work has earned recognition in the
Guinness_World_Records.[464][470][471]
On May 14, 1984, President Ronald_Reagan gave Jackson an award recognizing his
support of alcohol and drug abuse charities,[472] and in recognition of his
support for the Ad_Council's and the National_Highway_Traffic_Safety
Administration's Drunk Driving Prevention campaign. Jackson allowed the
campaign to use "Beat It" for its public service announcements.[473]
***** Artistry *****
**** Vocal style ****
Jackson was known as an expressive vocalist with absolute_pitch.[474][475][476]
Critics describe his vocal theatricality having a range from clear and soft to
harsh and aggressive,[477][478][479][480] depending on the genre sung.
Principally in history, Michael Jackson is the sole recipient to receive Grammy
Awards for three different genres of vocal performance (as a soloist), winning
Pop_Vocal for "Thriller", Rock_Vocal for "Beat_It", and Rhythm_and_Blues_Vocal
with both "Billie_Jean" and "Don't_Stop_'Til_You_Get_Enough". Bruce_Swedien,
his long-time sound engineer, emphasized that a critical element of their vocal
recordings are of him and Jackson trying numerous approaches to rhythmic,
emotional and technical distinctions to consummate a "sonic character".[481]
His stylings, such as common use of staccato, legato, falsetto as well as vocal
hiccups,[482] adlibs, wailings and growls are all signature to his sound.[483]
[484]
Jackson sang from childhood, and over time his voice and vocal style changed.
Between 1971 and 1975, his voice descended from boy soprano to lyric tenor.
[485] He was known for his intonation and vocal range.[433] Through each music
release, his vocal development and changes were positively narrated by music
journalists. With the arrival of Off the Wall in the late 1970s, Jackson's
abilities in his coming-of-age period had Rolling Stone comparing his vocals to
the "breathless, dreamy stutter" of Stevie Wonder, and wrote that "Jackson's
feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful. It slides smoothly into a
startling falsetto that's used very daringly."[486] By the time of 1982's
Thriller, Rolling Stone wrote that Jackson was singing in a "fully adult voice"
that was "tinged by sadness".[487] The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the
introspective album Dangerous. The New York Times noted that on some tracks,
"he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate
whisper, hissing through clenched teeth" and he had a "wretched tone". When
singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to "smooth"
vocals.[488] Of Invincible, Rolling Stone wrote that, at 43, Jackson still
performed "exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies".
[489] Joseph_Vogel notes Jackson's ability to use non-verbal sounds to express
emotion.[490] Neil_McCormick wrote that Jackson's unorthodox singing style "was
original and utterly distinctive".[491]
**** Influences ****
Jackson was influenced by musicians including James_Brown, Little_Richard,
Jackie_Wilson, Diana_Ross, Fred_Astaire, Sammy_Davis_Jr., Gene_Kelly,[492] and
David_Ruffin.[493] Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson,[494]
but Brown was his greatest inspiration. When Jackson was a small child, his
mother would wake him whenever Brown appeared on television. Jackson described
being "mesmerized".[495]
Jackson's vocal technique was influenced by Diana Ross; his use of the oooh
interjection from a young age was something Ross had used on many of her songs
with the_Supremes.[496] She was a mother figure to him, and he often watched
her rehearse.[497] He said he had learned a lot from watching how she moved and
sang, and that she had encouraged him to have confidence in himself.[498]
Choreographer David_Winters, who met Jackson while choreographing the 1971
Diana Ross TV special Diana!, said that Jackson watched the musical West_Side
Story almost every week, and it was his favorite film; he paid tribute to it in
"Beat It" and the "Bad" video.[499][500][501]
**** Musicianship ****
Jackson had no formal music training and could not read or write music
notation. He is credited for playing guitar, keyboard, and drums, but was not
proficient in them.[502] When composing, he recorded ideas by beatboxing and
imitating instruments vocally.[502] Describing the process, he said: "I'll just
sing the bass part into the tape_recorder. I'll take that bass lick and put the
chords of the melody over the bass lick and that's what inspires the melody."
These were shown in his demos for Beat It and Billie Jean where he vocalized
the melody, bass instrumentals as well as lead and backing vocals by overlaying
each component. The engineer Robert Hoffman recalled that after Jackson came in
with a song he had written overnight, Jackson sang every note of every chord to
a guitar player. Hoffman also remembered Jackson singing string arrangements
part by part into a cassette recorder.[502]
**** Dance ****
Jackson danced from a young age as part of the Jackson 5,[503] and incorporated
dance extensively in his performances and music videos.[503] According to
Sanjoy Roy of The_Guardian, Jackson would "flick and retract his limbs like
switchblades, or snap out of a tornado spin into a perfectly poised toe-stand".
[503] The moonwalk, taught to him by Jeffrey_Daniel,[77] was Jackson's
signature dance move and one of the most famous of the 20th century.[504]
Jackson is credited for coining the name "moonwalk" for this street dance move,
previously known as the "backslide".[505][506] His other moves included the
robot,[44][507] crotch grab, and the "anti-gravity" lean of the "Smooth
Criminal" video.[503]
**** Themes and genres ****
[Black_and_white_photo_of_Jackson_holding_a_microphone_and_singing.]Jackson
during his Bad_World_Tour in Vienna, June 1988
Jackson explored genres including pop,[4][508] soul,[4][154] rhythm_and_blues,
[508] funk,[509] rock,[508][509] disco,[510] post-disco,[509] dance-pop[511]
and new_jack_swing.[4] Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the
strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive,
while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful.[4] Its tracks
included the ballads "The Lady in My Life", "Human_Nature", and "The_Girl_Is
Mine",[512][487][513] the funk pieces "Billie Jean" and "Wanna Be Startin'
Somethin'",[512][487] and the disco set "Baby_Be_Mine" and "P.Y.T._(Pretty
Young_Thing)".[513]
With Off the Wall, Jackson's "vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans,
and asides" vividly showed his maturation into an adult, Robert_Christgau wrote
in Christgau's_Record_Guide:_Rock_Albums_of_the_Seventies (1981). The album's
title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie
Wonder's "oddball" music personas: "Since childhood his main contact with the
real world has been on stage and in bed."[514] With Thriller, Christopher
Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association
with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery.[487] AllMusic's
Stephen_Thomas_Erlewine noted this on the songs "Billie Jean" and "Wanna Be
Startin' Somethin'".[512] In "Billie Jean", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan
who alleges he has fathered her child,[4] and in "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"
he argues against gossip and the media.[487] "Beat It" decried gang violence in
a homage to West_Side_Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over
piece, according to Huey.[4][35] He observed that "Thriller" began Jackson's
interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent
years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem "We Are the World";
humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public
persona.[4]

In Bad, Jackson's concept of the predatory lover is seen on the rock song
"Dirty Diana".[515] The lead single "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" is a
traditional love ballad, and "Man in the Mirror" is a ballad of confession and
resolution. "Smooth_Criminal" is an evocation of bloody assault, rape and
likely murder.[134] AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine states that Dangerous
presents Jackson as a paradoxical person.[516] The first half of the record is
dedicated to new jack swing, including songs like "Jam" and "Remember the
Time". It was the first Jackson album in which social ills became a primary
theme; "Why You Wanna Trip on Me", for example, protests world hunger, AIDS,
homelessness and drugs. Dangerous contains sexually charged songs such as "In
the_Closet". The title track continues the theme of the predatory lover and
compulsive desire. The second half includes introspective, pop-gospel anthems
such as "Will_You_Be_There", "Heal the World" and "Keep the Faith".[488] In the
ballad "Gone_Too_Soon", Jackson gives tribute to Ryan White and the plight of
those with AIDS.[517]
HIStory creates an atmosphere of paranoia.[518] In the new jack swing-funk rock
tracks "Scream" and "Tabloid Junkie", and the R&B ballad "You_Are_Not_Alone",
Jackson retaliates against the injustice and isolation he feels, and directs
his anger at the media.[519] In the introspective ballad "Stranger_in_Moscow",
Jackson laments his "fall from grace"; "Earth Song", "Childhood", "Little
Susie" and "Smile" are operatic pop songs.[518][519] In "D.S.", Jackson attacks
lawyer Thomas_W._Sneddon_Jr., who had prosecuted him in both child sexual abuse
cases; he describes Sneddon as a white supremacist who wanted to "get my ass,
dead or alive".[520] Invincible includes urban soul tracks such as "Cry" and
"The Lost Children", ballads such as "Speechless", "Break of Dawn", and
"Butterflies", and mixes hip hop, pop, and R&B in "2000 Watts", "Heartbreaker"
and "Invincible".[521][522]

Jackson released "Thriller", a 14-minute music video directed by John_Landis,
in 1983.[523] The zombie-themed video "defined music videos and broke racial
barriers" on MTV, which had launched two years earlier.[38] Before Thriller,
Jackson struggled to receive coverage on MTV, allegedly because he was African
American.[524] Pressure from CBS Records persuaded MTV to start showing "Billie
Jean" and later "Beat It", which led to a lengthy partnership with Jackson, and
helped other black music artists gain recognition.[525] The popularity of his
videos on MTV helped the relatively new channel's viewing figures, and MTV's
focus shifted toward pop and R&B.[525][526] His performance on Motown 25:
Yesterday, Today, Forever changed the scope of live stage shows, making it
acceptable for artists to lip-sync to music video on stage.[527] The
choreography in Thriller has been copied in Indian_films and prisons_in_the
Philippines.[528] Thriller marked an increase in scale for music videos, and
was named the most successful music video ever by the Guinness World Records.
[221]
In "Bad"'s 19-minute video‚Äîdirected by Martin_Scorsese‚ÄîJackson used sexual
imagery and choreography, and touched his chest, torso and crotch. When asked
by Winfrey in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed his crotch, he said it
was spontaneously compelled by the music. Time magazine described the "Bad"
video as "infamous". It featured Wesley_Snipes; Jackson's later videos often
featured famous cameo roles.[529][530] For the "Smooth Criminal" video, Jackson
experimented with leaning forward at a 45-degree angle, beyond the performer's
center of gravity. To accomplish this live, Jackson and designers developed a
special shoe to lock the performer's feet to the stage, allowing them to lean
forward. They were granted U.S._patent_5,255,452 for the device.[531] The video
for "Leave Me Alone" was not officially released in the US, but in 1989 was
nominated for three Billboard Music Video Awards[532] and won a Golden Lion
Award for its special effects. It won a Grammy for Best_Music_Video,_Short
Form.[59]
He received the MTV_Video_Vanguard_Award in 1988; in 2001 the award was renamed
in his honor.[533] The "Black or White" video simultaneously premiered on
November 14, 1991, in 27 countries with an estimated audience of 500¬†million
people, the largest audience ever for a music video at the time.[170] Along
with Jackson, it featured Macaulay_Culkin, Peggy_Lipton, and George_Wendt. It
helped introduce morphing to music videos.[534] It was controversial for scenes
in which Jackson rubs his crotch, vandalizes cars, and throws a garbage can
through a storefront. He apologized and removed the final scene of the video.
[158]
"In the Closet" featured Naomi_Campbell in a courtship dance with Jackson.[535]
"Remember the Time" was set in ancient_Egypt, and featured Eddie_Murphy, Iman,
and Magic_Johnson.[536] The video for "Scream", directed by Mark_Romanek and
production designer Tom Foden, gained a record 11 MTV_Video_Music_Award
Nominations, and won "Best Dance Video", "Best Choreography", and "Best Art
Direction".[537] The song and its video are Jackson's response to being accused
of child molestation in 1993.[538] A year later, it won a Grammy for Best Music
Video, Short Form. It has been reported as the most_expensive_music_video_ever
made, at $7¬†million;[539] Romanek has contradicted this.[540] The "Earth Song"
video was nominated for the 1997 Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form.[541]
Michael_Jackson's_Ghosts, a short film written by Jackson and Stephen_King and
directed by Stan_Winston, premiered at the 1996 Cannes_Film_Festival. At over
38 minutes long, it held the Guinness world record for the longest music video
until 2013, when it was eclipsed by the video for the Pharrell_Williams song
"Happy".[542] The 2001 video for "You_Rock_My_World" lasts over 13 minutes, was
directed by Paul_Hunter, and features Chris_Tucker and Marlon_Brando.[543] It
won an NAACP_Image_Award for Outstanding Music Video in 2002.[544]
In December 2009, the Library_of_Congress selected "Thriller" as the only music
video to be preserved in the National_Film_Registry, as a work of "enduring
importance to American culture".[545][546] Huey wrote that Jackson transformed
the music video into an artform and a promotional tool through complex story
lines, dance routines, special effects and famous cameos, while breaking down
racial barriers.[4]

traditional kingdom located in the south-east of Ivory_Coast.[567] In July
2009, the Lunar Republic Society named a crater on the Moon after Jackson.[568]
In August, for what would have been Jackson's 51st birthday, Google dedicated
their Google_Doodle to him.[569] In 2012, the extinct hermit crab
Mesoparapylocheles_michaeljacksoni was named in his honor.[570] In 2014, the
British_Council of Cultural Relations deemed Jackson's life one of the 80 most
important cultural moments of the 20th century.[571] World_Vitiligo_Day has
been celebrated on June 25, the anniversary of Jackson's death, to raise
awareness of the auto-immune disorder that Jackson suffered from.[572]
***** Earnings *****
Main article: Estate_of_Michael_Jackson
In 1989, Jackson's annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts
were estimated at $125¬†million.[221] Forbes placed Jackson's annual income at
$35¬†million in 1996 and $20¬†million in 1997.[573] Jackson has been one of the
wealthiest celebrities and musical_artists; estimates of Jackson's net worth
during his life range from negative $285¬†million to positive $350¬†million for
2002, 2003 and 2007.[574][575] Forbes reported in August 2018 that Jackson's
total career pretax earnings in life and death were $4.2¬†billion.[576][577]
Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an estimated
$300¬†million in royalties. He may have earned another $400¬†million from
concerts, music publishing (including his share of the Beatles catalog),
endorsements, merchandising and music videos.[578]
In 2013, the executors of Jackson's estate filed a petition in the United
States_Tax_Court as a result of a dispute with the Internal_Revenue_Service
(IRS) over US_federal_estate_taxes.[579] The executors claimed that it was
worth about $7¬†million, while the IRS that it was worth over $1.1¬†billion. In
February 2014, the IRS reported that Jackson's estate owed $702¬†million;
$505¬†million in taxes, and $197¬†million in penalties.[580] A trial was held
from February 6 to 24, 2017.[581] In 2021, the Tax Court issued a ruling in
favor of the estate, ruling that the estate's total combined value of the
estate was $111.5 million and that the value of Jackson's name and likeness was
$4 million (not the $61 million estimated by the IRS's outside expert witness).
[582]
In 2016, Forbes estimated annual gross earnings by the Jackson Estate at
$825¬†million, the largest ever recorded for a celebrity, mostly due to the sale
of the Sony/ATV catalog.[583] In 2018, the figure was $400¬†million.[584] It was
the eighth year since his death that Jackson's annual earnings were reported to
be over $100¬†million, thus bringing Jackson's postmortem total to $2.4¬†billion.
[585] Forbes has consistently recognized Jackson as one of the top-earning_dead
celebrities since his death, and placed him at the top spot from 2013 to 2023.

      Jehovah's Witnesses. There was strong opposition to his "Thriller" video
      on the part of some Witnesses. Perhaps the controversy figured into his
      decision to leave. But I don't know that for a fact because I didn't talk
      to him about what he'd done. I couldn't. Witnesses do not discuss
      spiritual matters with a person who has disassociated himself from the
      Witnesses, including family members. But I want to stress that, contrary
      to published reports, I was not required to "shun" my son. Our
      relationship is as loving today as it was when he was a Witness. I just
      can't ask him, "Why, Michael?"

Folklore and ‚Äúlocal colour‚Äù
There is a story that when Alexandre Dumas‚Äô play Christine was banned, shortly
before the 1830 Revolution, Dumas went to plead his case to the acad√©micien and
censor Charles Brifaut. Brifaut suggested what seemed to him minor alterations,
such as the sex of the protagonist, and mentioned that under the First Empire
he had been obliged to do much the same. A play of his set in Spain was
considered too inflammatory given the Emperor‚Äôs difficulties in that country,
so he changed some names and locations, and transformed it into Ninus II, an
acceptable drama of ancient Babylon. Dumas exclaimed¬†: ‚ÄúBut really, Monsieur
Brifaut, the local colour¬†!‚Äù Brifaut smiled and replied ‚ÄúMonsieur, in our time,
for us, local colour had not yet been invented.‚Äù¬†[1]
Brifaut‚Äôs cynicism is echoed by many contemporary historians. Dumas was shocked
because Brifaut had, in his opinion, sacrificed the authenticity of the work¬†:
what was true of Spain could not also be true of Babylon. But for post-modern
historians, trained to unpick ‚Äúinvented traditions‚Äù and ‚Äúimagined communities‚Äù,
the Romantics‚Äô yearning for authenticity has itself become suspect.¬†[2] The
whole nineteenth-century enterprise of defining cultural difference through
nation-building, imperial exploration and social investigation, can be seen in
retrospect as a fabrication in which the self-serving taxonomies of elites were
imposed on suspect data. The academic subjects built on this concern for
explaining difference _ history, sociology, and anthropology _ have likewise
had their credentials as social sciences severely weakened.¬†[3] But the subject
which has suffered most by the retreat into ‚Äúreflexivity‚Äù is folklore. Pioneer
sociologists and anthropologists may have been keen to collect and classify,
but from the start folklorists saw themselves in a more active role, reviving
threatened traditions. The issue of authenticity was always, therefore, of
greater significance to folklore.¬†[4]
For romantics like Dumas, an enthusiastic reader and translator of the Grimms,
folklore was all about local colour. The subject had been born out of an
assertion of cultural difference, in reaction to the universalist ambitions of
the Enlightenment. Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) put its case most
clearly¬†: what was true and good for France was alien to Germany, for each
nation had, over centuries, developed its own unique traditions, ideally suited
to the character of its people. The essence of this unique culture, what Herder
called the ‚Äúfolk-soul‚Äù, was expressed in language and in particular in folk-
song and tale. No one person could claim authorship of ballads, they were the
communal, almost unconscious creation of the nation as a whole. Every singer
was connected to the collective body of the nation, and simultaneously to their
ancestors, from whom they had inherited this traditional lore.¬†[5]
This is a well-known story, but there is one point that I would like to
emphasise. Herder believed that the origins of cultural difference lay in the
environment¬†: ‚ÄúNature has sketched with the mountain ranges she formed and with
the rivers she made flow from them the rough but definite outline of the entire
history of man‚Ä¶ Oceans, mountain chains, and rivers are the most natural
boundaries not only of lands, but also of peoples, customs, languages, and
empires.‚Äù¬†[6] The customs of each nation had been shaped by the landscape in
which they lived. Folklore was not just the expression of a people and its
history, but of the land itself. Thus the Grimms were able to describe the
tales collected from their their principal informants, Dorothea Viehmann (the
so-called M√§rchenfrauof Niederzwehren) and ‚ÄúOld Marie‚Äù, as ‚Äúauthentically
Hessian‚Äù and ‚Äúoriginally Hessian‚Äù.¬†[7] Emile Souvestre (1806-1854), a romantic
poet and one of the earliest imitators of the Grimms in France, expressed this
connection between story and geography in an environmental clich√© when
introducing his 1844 collection Le Foyer breton¬†: ‚Äúwe have only published those
[folktales] which exhale that smell of the land which cannot be imitated.‚Äù¬†[8]
More than a hundred years later, the compiler of the French folktale index,
Paul Delarue, echoed this sentiment¬†: ‚Äúin France as in the other countries
[folktales] have through the course of the centuries been subjected to the
influence of the physical and human environment, of the particular genius of
the race¬†; and they have acquired characteristics that are unique.‚Äù¬†[9]
These unique characteristics might be obvious to collectors, able to compare
and contrast the narrative tradition of many communities, but it is
questionable whether they could have been identified by the narrators of
folktales. Folklorists seldom asked their informants where they thought their
stories originated but Ariane de F√©lice, who conducted fieldwork in the
marshland of the Loire estuary after the Second World War, was the exception.
She was told ‚ÄúThey must have been more intelligent than most, the guys who
invented this‚Ä¶ You won‚Äôt find that here. They come perhaps from the depths of
England, or I don‚Äôt know where.‚Äù¬†[10] Their exotic quality was indeed part of
the tales‚Äô attraction. None of her narrators, who all came from the one
village, suggested that there was anything particularly Breton about their
tales, and yet F√©lice‚Äôs book was entitled Contes de Haute-Bretagne. To this day
it is almost impossible to find a folktale collection which does not claim to
be in some way expressive of a region or nation. The primacy of collective
identities, be they ethnic, cultural or geographic, is the legacy bequeathed by
romantic nationalism to folklore.
Folk wisdom, however, recognised the ease with which songs and stories were
diffused around the globe, and this has been understood at a scholarly level
also. Delarue catalogued the French folktales according to the international
index of tale-types. The tale of Cinderella is tale-type 510, and one can go to
the folktale catalogue of any country from China to the Caribbean and find
examples of tales that fit this typology.¬†[11] The story was popular in France,
but not specific to France. The same is true of other genres of folklore¬†:
whether we are talking of riddles, proverbs, legends, or folksongs, it is
difficult to find examples limited to just one region or one nation. They all
have analogues in other countries. Delarue knew this, his argument was that the
way Cinderella was told in France was characteristically French. For example,
it lacked the cruelty and overt moralising that he associated with German
tales.¬†[12] And it is true that while Cinderella was moreorless universally
known, the tale was never told exactly the same way in different places. But
was this variation a reflection of national or regional cultural difference, or
did it have more to do with the sex of the narrators, their occupations and
personalities, or the personalities of the collectors¬†?
This last is the most serious charge for it threatens not only to deny
folklore‚Äôs claims to reveal specific cultures, but to undermine the entire
collecting project. What if folklorists, as collectors and editors, shaped the
final work to fit ideological agendas of their own¬†? This is indeed the
accusation levelled at Emile Souvestre, and even more so at his contemporary,
Th√©odore Hersart de la Villemarqu√© (1815-1895). The publication in 1839 of
Villemarqu√©‚Äôs Barzaz-Breiz _ Breton Ballads _ had an impact in France akin to
MacPherson‚Äôs Ossian. Unfortunately there were other parallels. Villemarqu√© was
a Breton patriot who wanted to endow his homeland with an epic literature to
rival that of any nation. He was also an aristocrat, a conservative and a
Catholic, and the Breton nation he envisioned was pious, deferential, and
static, preserved by its language and traditions from the taint of
revolutionary modernity. The ballads he ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù suited all these purposes
admirably. Although he styled himself as the ‚Äúcollector and translator‚Äù of the
Breton ballads, the suspicion arose that he was in fact their author.¬†[13]
 The Querelleover the authenticity of theBarzaz-Breiz,which irrupted in 1867,
continues to rumble on, but a prevailing, albeit erroneous, judgement in
academic circles is that Villemarqu√©‚Äôs ballads, like MacPherson‚Äôs fragments,
were forgeries.¬†[14]
Villemarqu√© is not the only nineteenth-century folklorist to fall under the
critical spot-light not least because many French folklorists were likewise
aligned with the Catholic, Royalist right. Their desire to establish a
connection between the land and its people through its folklore has been seen
as a defensive ploy by traditional elites, landowners and clerics, in the face
of rural depopulation, social mobility and radical political upheaval. It is
not just that folklorists were local patriots with regionalist or autonomist
objectives, though many were, but it is also a question of the kind of country
or region they were patriotic about. Why in France, for example, did
practically every folklorist reject the administrative boundaries created by
the Revolution, _ the departments _ in favour of collecting the folklore of the
Old Regime provinces, such as Lorraine, Franche-Comt√©, Normandy‚Ä¶¬†? The implicit
or explicit explanation is that the provinces represented genuine cultural
units, but there is sometimes at least the hint of counter-revolutionary
nostalgia.¬†[15] Folklorists at the end of the nineteenth century claimed that
theirs was an objective science with its own vigorous methodology. But the
suspicion among academics today is that folklore was less the creation of the
‚Äúfolk‚Äù than the imposition derived from political and aesthetic movements among
d√©racin√© intellectuals.
The implications of such revisionism are not limited to folklore. With the
development of social history since the 1960s, historians have mined folklore
collections to uncover the hidden lives of the popular classes, developing such
explanatory schemas as popular religion, popular medicine, and popular
culture.¬†[16] Yet recently all these categories have been dismissed as
constructions derived from the discourses of nineteenth-century elites. Even
the very concept of ‚Äúpeasant‚Äù has been called into question.¬†[17] What, for the
last quarter of a century, has been the most influential approach to
nineteenth-century rural France _ Eugen Weber‚Äôs history of the acculturation of
regional and traditional societies in the process of transforming Peasants into
Frenchmen _ crumbles, if the very categories of peasant, tradition and region
were nothing more than the ideological projections of nation-builders.¬†[18] As
a consequence the peasants who seemed to speak to us from the pages of folklore
collections have been once more condemned to historical marginality, for their
voices will always be hidden behind the discourses of the dominant.

I am unwilling to accept this conclusion, and the remainder of this paper will
attempt to show that nineteenth-century folklorists were basically correct in
proposing a connection between cultural traditions and a particular community,
and that the relationship between the land and the lore was suggested to them
by their informants, rather than imposed on them. This does not mean that I
think folklorists always correctly identified what that connection was, and in
the case of France the largely unreflecting use of pre-revolutionary provincial
titles is unhelpful. But mislabelling should not prevent us realising what
folklorists intuitively grasped, that there was a link between the stories they
heard and the landscapes in which they were told. To demonstrate this I will
call on the collection made by Paul S√©billot (1843-1918) between 1879 and 1885
in and around the village of Saint-Cast, near to Saint-Malo on the north Breton
coast.

Paul S√©billot and the storytellers of Saint-Cast
Although Paul S√©billot was the dominant figure in French folklore studies at
the end the nineteenth century, he did not conform to the stereotype of the
Breton traditionalist. He was certainly no pious aristocrat like Villemarqu√©,
and it is worth mentioning that, despite the supposed inherent conservatism of
folklorists, in Brittany at least it was as much an enthusiasm of the left.
Emile Souvestre had stood as a Republican candidate in 1849, while leading
contemporaries of S√©billot included Fran√ßois-Marie Luzel and Adolphe Orain,
both editors of Republican newspapers.¬†[19] S√©billot was born at Matignon
(C√¥tes-du-Nord) in 1843, the son of a doctor and a Republican activist.¬†[20] He
inherited his father‚Äôs politics, writing a popular pamphlet in 1875 entitled La
R√©publique, c‚Äôest la tranquilit√©, which Luzel translated into Breton.¬†[21] He
married the sister of the economist and Republican politician Yves Guyot, who
as editor of Le Si√®cle was a well-known advocate of radical causes from Dreyfus
to feminism. Yet despite his Republican and anticlerical affiliations, in other
ways S√©billot was true to the folklorist type. He was a member of a well-
educated and well connected bourgeois family¬†; a rival folklorist would later
accuse him of abusing his position as ‚Äúch√¢telain‚Äù to make his collections.¬†[22]
He was also a d√©racin√©, having settled in Paris, first as a law student, and
then as an artist and writer. Folklore, at least initially, had been the exiled
S√©billot‚Äôs tribute to his homeland. His local patriotism had been fired by a
borrowed copy of Souvestre‚Äôs Le Foyer breton while a homesick schoolboy in
1860. In his memoirs S√©billot recalled that ‚Äúthe idea came to me to discover‚Ä¶
if there were in my native land, marvellous or fantastic stories worthy of
inclusion in a Gallo Hearth.‚Äù¬†[23] But what attracted S√©billot most about
Souvestre‚Äôs book were the illustrations, for he was already nursing artistic
ambitions. From 1867 to 1880 he pursued a career as a painter. As the art
critic for various Republican journals in the 1870s, and a visitor to Pont-
Aven, S√©billot presumably knew of the impressionists, but he did not follow
their lead. Nor, despite his interest in the ‚Äúmarvellous‚Äù is there anything
fey, let alone symbolist, about his paintings. S√©billot‚Äôs artistic allegiances
were with the realism of Am√©d√©e Gu√©rard and Alexandre Antigna.¬†[24] He
specialised in landscapes of the Breton coast, and in particular the strange
scenery of low tide (his first salon piece in 1870 was entitled Rocks at Low
Tide). This is not a minor genre along Brittany‚Äôs c√¥te d‚Äôemeraude where the
sea-level falls several metres daily, revealing the rocks that made this coast
so dangerous for shipping.¬†[25]
There is an unexplored connection between the practice of landscape painting
and folklore collecting in the nineteenth century. Souvestre had been a painter
before he turned to writing, while artists like Jules Bastien-Lepage
occasionally dabbled in folklore.¬†[26] In S√©billot‚Äôs case the meticulousness
and commitment to accuracy apparent in his paintings would also resurface in
his work as a folklorist, for although he acknowledged a debt to predecessors
like Villemarqu√© he considered himself the leader of a new generation of
scientific investigators. S√©billot‚Äôs conversion from brush to pen was
particularly fruitful. In 1877 the artist L√©once Petit asked S√©billot if he
could contribute some stories to a book of fairy-tales that his friend hoped to
illustrate. S√©billot promised to see what he could unearth the following summer
while on a painting trip to Brittany. But the weather that year was dismal, and
while sheltering with peasant families, S√©billot asked his hosts if they knew
any tales. The more than six hundred narratives he collected over the following
years were the basis for S√©billot‚Äôs brilliant career as a folklorist.¬†[27] They
provided the matter for more than a dozen major publications, starting in 1880
with the first volume of Contes populaires de la Haute-Bretagne.¬†[28]
The title implied that these were characteristically Breton tales. S√©billot,
like other folklorists, placed his collection within the framework of a
geographically specific culture (a trend he would help propagate as editor of
the major collection Les Litt√©ratures populaires de toutes les nations). But
S√©billot was ahead of his time in recognising that his informants‚Äô occupations
were as significant to the kind of stories they told as the places they lived.
More than half the tales were collected in and around the fishing village of
Saint-Cast, not far from his hometown of Matignon. Hence the third volume of
the Contes populaires de la Haute-Bretagnewas subtitled Contes des marins.
S√©billot had come to Saint-Cast in 1879 to paint, but the storytelling talent
of his landlady Rose Renault set him on a different tack. Her house became the
centre of S√©billot‚Äôs collecting activities as her visitors were invited to
contribute a tale. Among them was the story in the appendix, told in 1880 by an
elderly widow named Jeanne le H√©riss√©. It concerns one of those watery rock
formations S√©billot painted so often _ the Bourdineaux.

Oral history and folk geography
The Bourdineaux (or Bourdinots as they now appear on maps) are a group of rocks
off the tip of the Saint-Cast peninsular, close to the spot marked 29 on
S√©billot‚Äôs map of the legendary geography of the area.¬†[29] For fishermen, the
virtue of these offshore rocks was that they were a haven for marine wild-life,
and, in the case of the Bourdineaux, for skate in particular. Le Heriss√©‚Äôs
story tells of a battle for control of the rocks between the C√¢tins of Saint-
Cast and the Jaguens of the rival fishing village of Saint-Jacut which faced
them across the Arguenon estuary. There are numerous stories about conflicts
between these two villages, several of which focus on this same group of rocks.
For example, in another tale the Jaguens drop a dead donkey in the sea in order
to claim all the land it touched, but unfortunately for them it by-passed the
Bourdineaux.¬†[30]
The donkey story was probably intended as a joke, but the Jeanne le H√©riss√©
told her tale as a matter of history. She had learnt it from her grandfather,
and according to him the battle had taken place two centuries before. It is
quite likely that the story has some basis in history. Ownership, or use
rights, over land was a dominant issue in village politics throughout France
from the Middle Ages onwards. Most communities were, at one time or another,
engaged in protracted conflicts with their neighbours about their precise
boundaries, access to water, the use of the woods and pastures between them.
These kinds of resources were either communal property or at least considered
as communal property, and so any dispute would involve the community as a
whole. The court records of both old regime and post-revolutionary France
abound in such cases, but conflict was not restricted to legal argument, it was
carried into the fields.¬†[31]. Conscription rallies, fairs and even Breton
pardons were all occasions for collective violence, because at these events
rival villagers were bound to meet, and therefore argue with one another. In
some parts of France, even in the nineteenth-century, such riots frequently led
to fatalities.¬†[32] These village wars tended to have a history. Even if
boundaries were finally agreed, the vendetta between them left legacies of
triumphs to be boasted, humiliations to be avenged, events to be memorised and
retold at communal gatherings. The economic issue might be settled, but the
conflict was perpetuated through the village‚Äôs oral culture, which enshrined
its code of honour.
Although the Bourdineaux were at sea, their case was not essentially different
from any landlocked dispute. They were a collective economic resource to which
two communities laid claim. Looking at the map it would seem as if the C√¢tins
were in the right. There were, as they say in story, fishing right in front of
their homes. And yet other tales, even those told in Saint-Cast, acknowledged
some historic relationship between the Jaguens and the Bourdineaux.¬†[33] There
are two possible explanations for this. Firstly, the Jaguens specialised in the
fishing of skate. This is still apparent in the architecture of the village,
which is arranged in house-rows with a south-facing fa√ßade where the skate were
hung to dry. The smell was, to judge by the frequent comments in the tales,
appalling.¬†[34] As the Bourdineaux abounded in skate the Jaguens may have felt
a proprietorial interest in them. Secondly, fishing rights in the estuary of
the Arguenon river had been the seigneurial property of the Abbey of Saint-
Jacut, so fish caught in these waters had to be landed at Saint-Jacut. At a
pinch the Bourdineaux might be included within this seigneurial domain,
although they were at boundary of the open sea.¬†[35] As a consequence there
were, in the sixteenth century, numerous stands-off between the fishing fleets
of the two villages, leading to insults and even injuries. From the
seventeenth-century onwards the men of both communities found employment in
deep-sea fishing, in-shore fishing declined and with it the economic importance
of the Bourdineaux. But the dispute was not forgotten, and references to it
were sure to enliven encounters between the inhabitants of the two peninsulas.
Indeed the history was still being related in the 1970s, according to Herv√©
Collet, who audio-taped the same tale as told an old sailor of Saint-Jacut.
Unfortunately this Jaguen version of events probably owes more to a S√©billot
reprint than to any autochthon tradition, even though there are telling
differences between the two.¬†[36]
However, it was not to history that each group appealed during their
confrontation, but to legend, in particular to divergent legends of Gargantua.
The story also alludes to several other religious, comic and aetiological
legends which would help listeners make sense of their local geography.
Nineteenth-century folklorists were more interested in the text than the
context, and seldom asked themselves why particular stories were being told at
particular moments. But in Le H√©riss√©‚Äôs tale it is clear that legends were not
just amusing pastimes, they had a function¬†: it is this functional aspect that
provides the link between a particular landscape and the stories told within
it. Legends were mobilized as charters of ownership by the communities that
told them. According to the Jaguens the Bourdineaux belonged to them because
the rocks were thrown from their village by the giant Gargantua. The C√¢tins
agreed that Gargantua deposited the rocks, but not for the Jaguens, rather in
disgust at them.
There is a whole cycle of Gargantua legends concerning this coastline, often
associated with particular features such as Gargantua‚Äôs tooth near Saint-
Suliac, or his finger at Fort La Latte (both prehistoric standing stones).
S√©billot collected several Gargantua legends in Saint-Cast.¬†[37] They did not
concur in every detail, but it is nonetheless possible to compile an outline
biography for the giant that might have been recognised by C√¢tins. To
summarize, Gargantua was born at Pl√©venon. He liked to travel, and visited
Dinan, Saint-Malo, Paris and Jersey. In each place he terrorised the
inhabitants with his enormous appetite and marked the landscape in some
permanent way. His leap from Fort La Latte to Saint-Malo (or, in another
version, to Jersey), for instance, is commemorated by the indent of the giant‚Äôs
shoe on the cliff-top. Practically all the rocks off the coast were ascribed to
Gargantua‚Äôs actions. According to Fran√ßois Marquer, the C√¢tin cabinboy who was
S√©billot‚Äôs most forthcoming informant, the Becrond (or Bec rond, s it now
appears on maps), where the C√¢tin fleet waited to attack the Jaguens, was the
result of a Gargantuan bout of diarrhoea. The Bourdineaux were created shortly
after by the giant‚Äôs attempts to kill a barnacle goose flying out to sea by
throwing stones taken from the headland.¬†[38] Presumably the Jaguens were
referring to a similar story, localised in their own village, during their
confrontation on the Bourdineaux.
The C√¢tins‚Äô response was that Gargantua felt too much disgust for the Jaguens
to provide for them in this way. The story, as told in Saint-Cast, was that
Gargantua had been coming home to Pl√©venon when he came across a Jaguen boat
loaded with skate caught on the Bourdineaux. He gobbled down the boat, crew and
catch, but as his journey took him past Saint-Jacut, the smell of rotting fish
made him throw up his meal. The ballast stones from the boat were projected out
to sea and formed various islands towards Saint-Briac and Saint-Lunaire (in the
opposite direction to Saint-Cast, and therefore undisputed territory as far as
C√¢tins were concerned).¬†[39] In other stories Gargantua did not eat the Jaguen
boat, simply the smell of its cargo was enough to make him vomit up various
rocks and islands. In some tales Gargantua then quit the country with the words
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to see the Jaguens any more¬†; they will kill me with their
obnoxiousness‚Äù¬†; in others he really was overcome with disgust and died.¬†[40]
C√¢tins and Jaguens told two contradictory legends about Gargantua and the
Bourdineaux, but to what extent were either believed¬†? Belief used to be the
test that folklorists applied to distinguish a folktale from a legend, the
former being told as a fiction, and the latter as a true account.¬†[41] However,
it is difficult to see how anyone could countenance that a handful of ballast
stones provided the basis for several islands. All we can say is that the story
(just like Le H√©riss√©‚Äôs) was told as if it might be true, and so could be cited
as fact in disputes between the two villages. But belief was not as essential
as agreement among the community as to which was the right story (or rather,
which was the right story for a particular occasion). Which story you knew, and
told, about Gargantua, the Bourdineaux and the Jaguens, would indicate where
your loyalties lay. Thus the shared story became the basis for communal
solidarity.
Le H√©riss√©‚Äôs tale draws on many other distinctions between the two villages.
The two fleets even arrive on the scene in different kinds of boat¬†: those of
the Jaguens are called simply ‚Äúboats‚Äù, but the C√¢tins had ‚Äúdinghies‚Äù. Canot, or
dinghy, was the term used for the small, stubby, but manoeuvrable boats that
fishermen of both villages adopted during the nineteenth century.¬†[42] The
implication of the story, however, is that the C√¢tins had them first, they were
therefore more up-to-date and civilised than their neighbours.
This claim to cultural superiority was confirmed whenever the Jaguens opened
their mouths. By-and-large S√©billot‚Äôs fishermen-storytellers spoke good French
when telling tales, and were proud of it. Patois was, for them, the language of
peasants who had never learnt anything of the world.¬†[43] Yet, according to
S√©billot, whenever one of his storytellers adopted the voice of a Jaguen, he or
she would put on a distinct accent, and lace their speech with characteristic
swearing _ ‚ÄúDieu me danse‚Äù or ‚ÄúDieu me gagne‚Äù, a change S√©billot indicated on
the written page with italics. He went on to point out, however, that the level
of education (and therefore presumably correct French usage) was higher in
Saint-Jacut than in nearby villages.¬†[44] But for the storyteller it was not
necessary that Jaguens actually spoke like this, but that her audience (and the
other inhabitants of the region generally) understood that this was how Jaguens
were supposed to speak. Storytellers from all over France used similar tactics
to denigrate their despised neighbours.¬†[45]
A further distinction between the villages is offered by the collective
nicknames, the blason populaire, exchanged between the fishermen. The C√¢tins,
apparently because of the colour of their water-proofs, were called ‚Äúpetits
Jaunes‚Äù by the Jaguens, while the latter were termed ‚ÄúHouohaous‚Äù. According to
S√©billot most C√¢tins thought this was an insult, implying that the Jaguens
howled like dogs, but it may have derived from Saint Houohaou, the name given
by the fishermen to a rock at the end of the Saint-Jacut peninsular. As they
passed the rock Jaguens would offer up a prayer ‚ÄúSaint Houohaou, give us
mackerel‚Äù.¬†[46] Every village in France seems to have had at least one such
collective sobriquet, picking up on some distinguishing aspect of dress,
economic activity, character or history.¬†[47] However, the blasonwas not used
by the villagers themselves, only by their neighbours who were also their
enemies. They were commonly exchanged during disputes over territories. The
origins of many nicknames are obscure, but where they can be traced they often
relate to places or events on these disputed frontiers. The rock of Saint
Houohaou, for example, is at the edge of the commune of Saint-Jacut and the
open sea. It is, in a sense, a boundary marker. Geography and cultural identity
are once more brought together.
The people of Saint-Cast held the Jaguens in low esteem¬†: ‚ÄúDaft as a Jaguen‚Äù
went the local proverb.¬†[48] This reputation was widely known on the coast.
S√©billot collected stories about Jaguens at Dinard, Matignon, and even one from
an inhabitant of Saint-Jacut. At Dinan stories about idiots, whatever their
origin, were termed a ‚ÄúJaguens√©t√©s‚Äù.¬†[49] An example of such a tale is the
‚ÄúJaguens‚Äô Journey‚Äù. Because they were so backward and had never left their
village before, they mistook a field of flax for the sea, and a partridge for a
feathered fish.¬†[50] On another occasion they thought a lobster was the devil.¬†
[51] Similar, if less maritime, stories were told about dozens of other
villages in France and further afield, such as the famous ‚ÄúWise Men of Gotham‚Äù
in Nottinghamshire, just one of at least forty-five places in England described
as the ‚Äúvillage of fools‚Äù.¬†[52] ‚ÄúNumskull-tales‚Äù, as these kind of tales are
listed in the international type index, prove once more that folklore knows no
boundaries. One can find nearly identical stories in the literature of ancient
India, Turkey and China.¬†[53] But while they were known all over the world,
they were not told as universally valid, but rather only as true for particular
villages. It was not the folklorist who located them in the landscape, it was
the narrators.
We get a hint of the Jaguens‚Äô reputation near the beginning of this story, when
they demand that no guns be used, as no one in Saint-Jacut knew how to fire
one. But the full depth of their stupidity is saved until the end, when,
disgusted at Jesus for not helping them, even though they had taken the trouble
to bring him along on his cross, they drag the crucifix through the streets and
finally burn it. Despite (or more probably because of) the presence of an abbey
in the village, several Jaguen tales turn on their misunderstanding of, or
contempt for, both the symbols of the Church and its personnel. Hence the
proverbial phrase, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like the old Jaguens, who no more believed in God than
in his saints‚Äù.¬†[54] C√¢tins could also be anticlerical, even sceptical on
occasions, and yet still look down on their neighbours, not so much for their
lack of belief but because they did not know how to behave. Given S√©billot‚Äôs
politics he probably rather enjoyed these stories, although he got into a bit
of trouble with local Catholics when he published the story of the ‚ÄúLe Bon Dieu
de Saint-Jacut‚Äù in a local newspaper.¬†[55] In this story the Jaguens realise
they are the only village without such an asset, which may account for a series
of poor barley harvests. But even when they have erected their own crucifix,
the harvest are no better, so they beat and even shoot the figure of Jesus.
(This may be a deliberately ironic counter-comment to the common legend of
Breton piety in which a peasant refuses to strike a crucifix despite threats
from Republican troops, and dies a martyr‚Äôs death.)¬†[56] The Jaguens finally
decide to kill their God, but unsure how this might be done safely, they carry
him over to the Isle Agot in the bay and leave him there.¬†[57] Le H√©riss√©‚Äôs
tale picks up on both the Jaguens‚Äô anticlerical reputation and their
mistreatment of the crucifix. It is also has aetiological aspects because the
crucifix has since disappeared from the Isle Agot, yet one can still see the
base where it stood.
What Freud called the ‚Äúnarcissism of minor differences‚Äù mattered a lot in these
small, face-to-face communities. The untutored eye might have found little to
separate the villages of Saint-Cast and Saint-Jacut at the end of the
nineteenth-century, but C√¢tins would have been insulted by any such comparison.
It would have sullied their reputation, and reputation was vital to their well-
being. The advancement of credit, getting the best berths on ship, the chances
to make a good marriage, all depended on the good name of one‚Äôs family and
community. Yet reputation is a strange thing in that one can only increase
one‚Äôs own by diminishing one‚Äôs rivals. Telling numskull stories emphasises the
superior reputation of one‚Äôs own community by denigrating another‚Äôs, and this
helps reunite one‚Äôs village in a sense of its own worth. Otherwise it was in
danger of being torn apart by its own internal honour disputes between families
and colleagues.
A fishing community like Saint-Cast may have had particular need of the balm of
storytelling (which perhaps accounts for why S√©billot found it such a fertile
source). Fishermen liked to create for themselves a persona of aggressive
individualism, so unlike the servile peasants they despised. In folktales this
persona took shape as the hero ‚ÄúTribord Amures‚Äù, the sailor who gave way to no
man.¬†[58] Such attitudes helped the men to cope with the grinding misery of
their work on the Newfoundland banks, and the ruthless competition fostered
between them by the trawler captains. Much of S√©billot‚Äôs collection was told by
boys _ apprentice fishermen _ whose tales evinced characteristics of devil-may-
care heroism and a refusal ever to bow one‚Äôs head. Thus they demonstrated they
had acquired the fishermen‚Äôs morality and were ready to enter the world of men.
But fishermen also needed the community¬†: their work was dangerous and their
relied on warnings and help given by their colleagues¬†; if they died at sea
they needed to know that their loved ones would be cared for¬†; and if they were
denied access to their fishing grounds they needed the community to come to
their support, as in the case of the Bourdineaux. Storytelling was one
mechanism through which that community reconnected with itself.
This one story of the ‚ÄúBattle of the Bourdineaux‚Äù has led us on quite a tour of
the region around Saint-Cast, from Pl√©venon to the Isle Agot. For a storyteller
like Jeanne Le H√©riss√© the landscape oozed narratives. Stories endowed space
with meanings. Guided by her tale, Le H√©riss√©‚Äôs audience could orientate
themselves in the landscape¬†: aetiological legends like that of Gargantua‚Äôs
finger, and lieux-ditssuch as the Becrond, contained descriptions of landmarks
which together formed a working map of the area. Legends were an informal
education in significant geography¬†: one learnt the boundaries of one‚Äôs
community with one‚Äôs neighbours and, just as importantly, with the
supernatural. Legends connected the vital history of the community to its
environment. No C√¢tin fisherman could forget that his ancestors had fought and
won their claim to the Bourdineaux, for the rocks themselves were a daily,
visual mnemonic. During Rogationtide ceremonies in England, boys accompanying
the procession around the perimeter of the parish would be beaten at each
boundary marker, to help them more vividly their exact location.¬†[59] Legends
served a similar, if less painful function. They were the collective memory of
the community.
Storytelling also gave Jeanne Le H√©riss√© a continuing role in the village. The
Le H√©riss√© family had lived in Saint-Cast since at least the fifteenth century,
and although they had lost their letters of nobility in 1670, Jeanne‚Äôs great-
grandfather still styled himself ‚Äúnoble √©cuyer‚Äù when he built the manor of
Sainte Blanche in 1775. But since the revolution the family‚Äôs social status and
fortune had declined markedly. Jeanne‚Äôs grandfather had been a substantial
landowner, but Jeanne had married a simple fisherman, Marc Renault. Like so
many of his compatriots he had died at sea leaving her with at least five
children to bring up.¬†[60] A widow in her late fifties with three daughters
still living at home, Jeanne was in danger of becoming a marginal figure even
in a matriarchal community like Saint-Cast. Yet she retained some cultural
capital¬†: she knew things that might be important to future generations of
C√¢tins, like why the Bourdineaux belonged to them. In her story both C√¢tins and
Jaguens turn to their oldest inhabitants in this crisis because, as Jeanne puts
it, ‚Äúamong the old there is always one cleverer than the others‚Äù. She was, in
an oblique fashion, talking about herself.¬†[61] The lessons she gave in folk
geography staked her claim to full membership in the community.

***** ‚ÄòLa Bataille des Bourdineaux‚Äô *****

From Paul S√©billot,Contes Populaires de la Haute-Bretagne III¬†: Contes des
Marins, (Paris, 1883).
Au temps jadis, les Jaguens s‚Äô√©taient mis dans l‚Äôid√©e que le rocher des
Bourdineaux leur appartenait et qu‚Äôeux seuls avaient le droit d‚Äôy p√™cher.
Un jour, trois bateaux jaguens arriv√®rent pr√®s des Bourdineaux, et deux canots
de Saint-Cast qui vinrent ensuite mouill√®rent trop pr√®s des Jaguens, presque
dans leur affare.
_ Dieu me danse, mon fu,s‚Äô√©cri√®rent les Jaguens, rehale vitement ton aussi√®re¬†;
tu viens mouiller dans nos lignes, et pa√Øcher su‚Äô not‚Äô terrain.
_Est-ce que vous voudriez nous engarder de p√™cher devant sez nous¬†?r√©pondirent
les C√¢tins.
_Le rochier est √† ma, riposta le patron des Jaguens, entends-tu, petit Jaune¬†?
_Non fait, Ouohau, i n‚Äôest pas √† ta.
_Si fait, c‚Äôest un rocher que Gargantua nous a vol√©¬†; il l‚Äôa prins sez nous et
l‚Äôa jet√© ici en passant.
_N‚Äôest pas pour ta que Gargantua l‚Äôa jet√© ici, r√©pondirent les C√¢tins, ‚Äò√©tait
pour nous¬†; il avait trop dangier des Jaguens pour voula√Ø le lous donner.
Voil√† la bataille qui commence¬†; les Jaguens jet√®rent des cailloux aux C√¢tins
qui ripost√®rent, et finirent par sauter √† l‚Äôabordage des bateaux ennemis¬†: il y
eut deux Jaguens qui furent tr√®s maltrait√©s ce jour-l√†, et leur patron dit aux
C√¢tins¬†:
_Dieu me danse, mon fu, fau‚Äôra mettre la partie a demain¬†; j‚Äôamenerons do nous
tous les chefs des bas, et v‚Äôamenerez les v√¥tres¬†; les p‚Äôus forts aront les
Bourdiniaux. Mais n‚Äô fau‚Äôra point s‚Äô batt‚Äôe √† coups de fusi‚Äô, mon petit fu, n‚Äôy
en a pas iun dans Saint-J√©gu qui saige tirer¬†; je nous battrons do des sabres
et do des ba√Øonnettes, do des pierres et do des b√¢tons.
_C‚Äôest bien, r√©pondirent les C√¢tins, demain j‚Äôam√®nerons nos patrons et vous les
v√¥tres.
Voil√† les C√¢tins et les Jaguens partis chacun de son c√¥t√© pour se pr√©parer √† la
bataille du lendemain.
Quand les gens de Saint-Cast furent de retour, ils racont√®rent aux autres
p√™cheurs la dispute et le rendez-vous pour le lendemain. Les anciens
s‚Äôassembl√®rent, et comme parmi les vieux, il y en a toujours qui sont plus
rus√©s que les autres, l‚Äôun des anciens dit¬†:
_Il faudra laisser les Jaguens mouiller les premiers, puis vous vous mettrez du
bord du vent pour leur envoyer de la poussi√®re dans les yeux. Dites aux femmes
et aux enfants de prendre des sacs et de les remplir avec la poussi√®re des
routes et la cendre des foyers¬†; ce seront les munitions dont vous chargerez
vos bateaux.
Aussit√¥t les femmes et les enfants se mirent √† balayer les routes et √† ramasser
la poussi√®re dans les sacs et les vieilles femmes y mettaient la cendre de leur
foyer.
Le lendemain d√®s le matin, on vit sortir tous les bateaux de Saint-Jacut. Les
Jaguens avaient charg√© leurs embarcations avec des cailloux, et ils s‚Äô√©taient
arm√©s de sabres, de ba√Øonnettes et de b√¢tons. Ils amenaient avec eux, pour
juger la bataille, le plus ancien homme de la paroisse, le bonhomme Mateur, qui
avait cent treize ans.
Quand ils furent √† moiti√© route, ils se dirent¬†:
_Mon petit fu, quand j‚Äôarons battu les petits Jaunes, fau‚Äôra qu‚Äôi‚Äôs l√®vent la
main et prom√®gent de ne jamais retourner √®s Bourdiniaux.
_V√®re, mais devant qui qu‚Äôi‚Äôs l√®veront la main¬†?
_Faut aller queri‚Äôun bon Dieu.
Deux bateaux vir√®rent de bord et all√®rent √† Saint-Jacut¬†: ils d√©plant√®rent une
grande croix et la mirent sur un des ‚Äòcarr√©s‚Äô pour faire jurer les petits
Jaunes.
Les C√¢tins √©taient mouill√©s √† Becrond, et ils attendaient pour lever l‚Äôancre
que la flotte des Jaguens f√ªt arriv√©e aux Bourdineaux. Alors ils mirent √† la
voile, et pass√®rent au vent des Jaguens. Ils voyaient un des carr√©s qui avait
un calvaire attach√© √† son m√¢t, et le bonhomme Mateur qui se tenait au pied.
_Va√Øci l‚Äôbon Dieu,dirent les Jaguens, v‚Äôallez jurer devant li et l‚Äôbonhomme
Mateur qu‚Äôa cent treize ans, de ne p‚Äôus retourner √®s Bourdiniaux, ou bien le
combat va commencer.
_Quand vous voudrez, r√©pondirent les C√¢tins.
Et ils se mirent √† affarer et √† tendre leurs lignes.
_Le rochier-l√† est √† nous, dirent les Jaguens, faut lever l‚Äôancre, j‚Äôallons
compter di qu‚Äô√† tras, et si v√™tes cor mouill√©s, j‚Äôallons nous battre¬†: au p‚Äôus
fort la pouche.
Voil√† les Jaguens qui commencent √† jeter des cailloux sur leurs ennemis¬†; mais
les C√¢tins, qui √©taient au vent, d√©li√®rent leurs sacs, et la brise qui √©tait
fra√Æche envoyait la poussi√®re et la cendre sur les Jaguens qui en recevaient
sur les yeux, sur le nez, dans la bouche, dans les oreilles, et ne savaient o√π
se fourrer. On les entendait √©ternuer comme s‚Äôils avaient eu du tabac plein le
nez. Les C√¢tins, en continuant √† lancer de la poussi√®re, saut√®rent √†
l‚Äôabordage, et furent bient√¥t vainqueurs¬†; ce jour-l√† il y eut deux Jaguens qui
furent bless√©s, et un C√¢tin perdit l‚Äôoeil d‚Äôun coup de pierre. Alors les
Jaguens abattirent le calvaire, et le bonhomme Mateur leur dit¬†:
_Par ma fa, mon fu, faut abandonner les Bourdiniaux, les petits Jaunes sont les
p‚Äôus forts.
Les Jaguens lev√®rent l‚Äôancre¬†; comme ils s‚Äôen allaient on les entendait qui se
disputaient entre eux, et ils faisaient des reproches au bon Dieu.
_Je l‚Äôavions amen√© do nous, disaient-ils, pour nous servi‚Äô d‚Äôavocat, i‚Äô n‚Äôa ren
dit¬†: ‚Äòest le bon Dieu sans piti√©, i‚Äô n‚Äôa pas tant sieurement fait tourner le
vent.

[1]¬†‚ÄúMais cependant, monsieur Briffaut [sic], la couleur locale¬†¬†!‚Äù M.¬†Briffaut
sourit, de ce charmant sourire moiti√© protecteur moiti√© d√©daigneux, et qui
n‚Äôappartient qu‚Äô√† des l√®vres acad√©miques¬†: ‚ÄúMonsieur, dit-il, de notre temps, √†
nous autres, la couleur locale n‚Äô√©tait pas encore invent√©√©.‚Äù This story is
told, to make much the same point, in Patrice Boussel, Veill√©es du pays
normand, Paris, 1970, p.7. Dumas recalled his conversations with Brifaut at
some length in his memoirs, but according to his recollection what shocked him
was Brifaut‚Äôs casual attitude to historical accuracy, rather than local colour.

Cambridge, 1983¬†¬†; Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities¬†: Reflections on the
Origin and Spread of Nationalism, London, 1983. These two works have been very
influential on historical scholarship. Both concepts, at least in common usage
among historians, concern the mobilisation of collective identities supposedly
based on historical continuities, but which have in fact been constructed by
elites (or would-be elites) to meet the needs of current political ideologies.
[3]¬†Anthropology, in particular, has been forced onto the defensive. While
preparing this paper I chanced on this pithy challenge¬†: ‚Äúalmost every
generation of anthropologists has condemned previous researchers for faulty
studies, imperialistic or colonialist arrogance, or plain doctoring of the
material. The idea of the participant observer has little credibility in
academic circles, and the standing of much ethnographic research is these days
roughly on a par with reality TV.‚Äù Jenny Diski, review of David Gilmour

not associate myself with these remarks, I quote them merely to demonstrate
that such attitudes have become part of the academic mainstream.

****** Hyrule: A Geography and Cartography ******
By Bastian on May 8, 2010

                 a part of The_Missing_Link_series of articles
                              Article By Bastian
In nearly every The Legend of Zelda video game we explore a vast landscape,
usually called ‚ÄúHyrule‚Äù, and yet no two Hyrules are ever identical.
Are we meant to believe that Hyrule is constantly suffering cataclysmic natural
disasters which are dramatically changing its features? Or are we to assume
that there are many different lands all called Hyrule within the same world? Or
possibly worlds? Or should we believe that somehow all of these lands called
Hyrule are in fact one in the same?
I fancy the latter, myself, and my aim is to show how this can be possible,
despite the contrasting popular opinion.
***** In the Beginning‚Ä¶ *****
Let‚Äôs travel back in time to the beginning, to the earliest documentation of
this magical land. In the instruction manual for The Legend of Zelda, it
indicates that this game takes place ‚Äúin a little kingdom in the land of
Hyrule.‚Äù As we discover in the direct sequel, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link,
such a¬†description¬†couldn‚Äôt be more accurate. In this sequel we are presented
with a tiny representation of the vast landscape we traversed in the first
game. Clearly we are to believe that Hyrule as we knew it in The Legend of
Zelda is but one tiny piece of a grand land.
Comparing LoZ Hyrule to AoL Hyrule
I assert that nearly every video game that takes place within ‚ÄúHyrule‚Äù actually
takes place within the same vague area of Hyrule seen in The Legend of Zelda.
***** A Story and a Map *****
In each Zelda video game we are provided with two important documents: a legend
regarding the history preceding the story of the game, usually entitled
‚ÄúStory,‚Äù and a rough map of the geography that Link will discover in that
particular adventure.
Sometimes these two artifacts are very accurate and detailed in accordance with
the particular adventure at hand, but more often than not these documents are
so vague that they border on impressionistic.
Take, for instance, the original The Legend of Zelda: in the instruction manual
we are presented with a highly detailed clay representation of the landscape
matching almost identically the geography we see in the 8-bit game.
The Legend of Zelda's Hyrule
Now consider the map provided in Ocarina of Time: while it unquestionably gives
an accurate notion of the geography, it is by no means one-to-one indentical.
Ocarina of Time's Map
Are we then to believe that The Legend of Zelda‚Äôs blocky clay map of Hyrule is
more accurate than Ocarina‚Äôs merely because it better matches the in-game
landscape of its game? Certainly not. It would be absurd to believe that
geometric series of square features could ever naturally exist as a landscape.
We must then assume that ‚ÄúHyrule‚Äù as depicted in The Legend of Zelda is an
impression, only. If we take both the instruction manual map and in-game
landscape as impressionistic for The Legend of Zelda, why then should we take
any other representation of Hyrule any more literally?
In The Adventure of Link we are presented with two seperate maps, both rather
vague when it comes to comparing the landscape with that presented in the
videogame, and yet very different each from the other.
The two maps in the instruction manual for AoL
I take this varying degree of vagueness in the hand-drawn cartography, along
with the ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù verbage of the prehistory provided as ‚Äústory‚Äù (but that‚Äôs
another topic for another time) as the key to this controversial approach to
the accuracy of Hyrule‚Äôs geography in comparison to its cartographies.
Many insist that all of these Hyrules cannot possibly be the same Hyrule
because the geography is wildly changing and transforming between games. I
assert that the geography is not changing at all (or, at least not all that
dramatically). The actual problem instead stems from the degree of accuracy of
the cartography presented both in-game and via the map provided.
***** Ancient Maps of Earth *****
When we consider antique maps of our own world, we are often surprised at the
shapes and sizes of the continents. We wonder at the seemingly arbitrary
position of the major geographic features we are all so familiar with. How can
they have thought North America was so tiny? Why is China shaped like a
boomerang? Where is Greenland?


Antique Earth Maps
These antique maps display vastly different shapes and sizes of landmasses than
we know today. Why the dramatic difference? We know, of course, that these
continents and their features have not radically transformed since that era.
The true transformation is found in the improved accuracy of cartography tools
and theories. When we look at these antique maps and see the shapes and
proportions and complete¬†juxtaposition¬†of features we do not assume we are
looking at a different Earth. No, we understand that these are simply archaic
understandings of what Earth was thought to look like at that time.
***** All Hyrules Are One Hyrule *****
The notion that each game takes place in a different Hyrule is as absurd to me
as the Columbus-era idea that the Americas were actually the Orient. Clearly
each videogame deals with the same continents collectively known as ‚ÄúHyrule.‚Äù
The majority of the Zelda games take place in the region I term ‚ÄúSouthern
Hyrule.‚Äù Beginning with the original The Legend of Zelda, then A Link to the
Past, Ocarina of Time, The Wind Waker, The Minish Cap, Four Swords/
Adventures,and Twilight Princess. Even The Adventure of Link utilizes ‚ÄúSouthern
Hyrule,‚Äù albeit limitedly in a miniturized rendition to give scope to the
vastness of what I term ‚ÄúNorthern Hyrule‚Äù (the land just north of Death
Mountains) and ‚ÄúEastern Hyrule‚Äù (the continent to the east of North/South
Hyrule). It is my belief that Phantom Hourglass also takes place in a flooded
Northern and Eastern Hyrule.
Three Continents of Hyrule
So how can all these different landscapes be one and the same when their
geographies are so extremely different? It is because we are intended to take
these cartographies with a grain of salt. Sometimes it is as simple as ‚Äúup is
NOT north, north is to the right‚Äù (as is the case in The Minish Cap).
Similarly: with Ocarina of Timewe find north to have shifted about 45 degrees
counter-clockwise. As long as we orient Death Mountain at the top of the map,
we find the basic major features orient themselves in roughly the same areas.
A Link to the Past vs. Ocarina of Time
The only thing changing in the geographies is the cartographer‚Äôs understanding
or impression of it. It is then unsuprising when we take a simplified snapshot
of a portion of Southern Hyrule in each of these cartographies that we always
find the Death Mountain(s) to the north, Hyrule Castle just south of that, an
enormous lake to the east, and an equally large desert to the west.
Comparing the Hyrules
***** The Moving Village and Castle *****
What of Kakariko Village? It seems to be leaping about the landscape wildly. If
the other major geographic features are fairly static map-to-map why then does
it seem as if Kakariko and Hyrule Castle can never stay in the same place in
each game? This can be explained in two very different ways:
   1. As these maps are highly impressionistic, the village remains in the same
      place throughout history, but each cartographer‚Äôs notion of where it
      existed is different (consider legendary Camelot and the debate
      concerning the three different argued locations of Cadbury, Camelford,
      and Caerleon).
   2. The Kakariko Village presented in Ocarina of Time has been destroyed/
      deserted (and thus is the ‚Äúhidden town‚Äù found inTwilight Princess) with a
      New Kakariko having been built further west.
Along that same line: could it also be possible that an earlier Hyrule Castle
(presented in Ocarina of Time) has been destroyed at some point prior to
Twilight Princess, with a new Hyrule Castle having been built farther east,
closer to where Lon Lon Ranch once stood? If so, this could explain the ruins
found all throughout Twilight Princess‚Äò Lost Woods, including the ruins of the
Temple of Time. Later, then, we would find that these are the same Lost Woods
found in A Link to the Past and that the only thing left of the ruins of the
Temple of Time is the dias and pedestal where Link discovers the Master Sword.
In this A Link to the Past-era Hyrule, Kakariko now stands just south of the
ruins of the Temple of Time/Lost Woods‚Ä¶ precicely where the ancient Hyrule
Castle from Ocarina-era stood.
Then again, perhaps these are all simply misinterpretations or slightly
different notions according to each cartographer.
***** The True Map *****
So which of all the maps is the most accurate? That remains to be seen. Perhaps
they are each equally accurate/inaccurate. Or maybe it stands to reason that
the most recent telling (Twilight Princess) is the most accurate; as our
Nintendo staff cartographers‚Äô tools (advancement of realism of graphics)
improve, so too does the accuracy of the geography. If the rumors of Eiji
Aonuma‚Äôs desire to release a 3D A Link to the Past ever comes to fruition, it
will be exciting to see how this cartography compares to that of it‚Äôs 16-bit
predecesor.
One thing remains certain, however: regardless of its geography, Hyrule never
ceases to prove full of fun and adventure. And, really, that‚Äôs all that matters
in the end.

Spin-offs      List_of_spin-offs
The Legend of Zelda[a] is a media_franchise created by the Japanese game
designers Shigeru_Miyamoto and Takashi_Tezuka. It is primarily developed and
published by Nintendo; some portable installments and re-releases have been
outsourced to Flagship, Vanpool, Grezzo, and Tantalus_Media.
The series centers on the various incarnations of Link, a courageous young man
of the elf-like Hylian race, and Princess_Zelda, a princess within the
bloodline of the goddess_Hylia, as they fight to save the land of Hyrule from
Ganon, an evil warlord turned demon king, who is the principal antagonist of
the series. Ganon wishes to use the Triforce, a sacred relic left behind by the
three goddesses that created Hyrule, to remake the world in his own dark image.
When gathered together, the power of the Triforce can grant any wish its user
desires, but if someone with a heart that does not possess a balance of the
three virtues of Power, Courage, and Wisdom attempts to touch the Triforce, it
will split into three triangles and bond with three people whose hearts embody
the required virtue.
Although their personalities and backstory differ from game to game, the
incarnations of Link and Zelda often have many traits in common, such as Link
often being left-handed and clad in green, and Zelda being associated with
wisdom, light, and prophecy. While the conflict with Ganon serves as a backbone
for the series, some games have featured other settings and antagonists, with
Link traveling or being sent to these other lands in their time of need.
Since The_Legend_of_Zelda was released in 1986, the series has expanded to
include 21_entries on all of Nintendo's major game_consoles, as well as a
number of spin-offs. An American animated_TV_series_based_on_the_games aired in
1989 and manga_adaptations commissioned by Nintendo have been produced in Japan
since 1997. The Legend of Zelda is one of Nintendo's most successful
franchises; several of its entries are considered among the greatest_video
games_of_all_time.

Gameplay of The Legend of Zelda games feature a mix of puzzles, action-
adventure, and exploration. These elements have remained constant throughout
the series, with refinements and additions featured in each new game. Later
games in the series include stealth gameplay, where the player must avoid
enemies while proceeding through a level, as well as racing elements. Although
the games can be beaten with a minimal amount of exploration and side_quests,
the player is frequently rewarded with helpful items or increased abilities for
solving puzzles or exploring hidden areas. Some items are consistent and appear
many times throughout the series (such as bombs and bomb flowers, which can be
used both as weapons and to open blocked or hidden doorways; boomerangs, which
can kill or paralyze enemies; keys for locked doors; magic_swords, shields, and
bows_and_arrows), while others are unique to a single game. Though the games
contain role-playing elements (Zelda_II:_The_Adventure_of_Link is the only one
to include an experience system), they emphasize straightforward hack-and-
slash-style combat over the strategic, turn-based or active_time combat of
series like Final_Fantasy. The game's role-playing elements, however, have led
to much debate over whether or not the Zelda games should be classified as
action_role-playing_games, a genre on which the series has had a strong
influence.[1] Miyamoto himself disagreed with the role-playing label, and
classified Zelda as "a real-time adventure game"; he said that he was "not
interested in systems where everything in the game is decided by stats and
numbers" but wanted "to preserve as much of that "live" feeling as possible",
and felt that action_games are better suited to convey to players.[2]
[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Zelda_clone_mockups.png/
220px-Zelda_clone_mockups.png]The Legend of Zelda often includes nonlinear
gameplay and varying environments in an explorable world, similar to this
illustration.
Every game in the main Zelda series has consisted of three principal areas: an
overworld which connects all other areas, in which movement is
multidirectional, allowing the player some degree of freedom of action; areas
of interaction with other characters (merely caves or hidden rooms in the first
game, but expanding to entire towns and cities in subsequent games) in which
the player gains special items or advice, can purchase equipment or complete
side quests; and dungeons, areas of labyrinthine layout, usually underground,
comprising a wide range of difficult enemies, bosses, and items. Each dungeon
usually has one major item inside, which can be essential for solving many of
the puzzles within that dungeon and often plays a crucial role in defeating
that dungeon's boss, as well as progressing through the game. In nearly every
Zelda game, navigating a dungeon is aided by locating a map, which reveals its
layout, and a magic compass, which reveals the location of significant and
smaller items such as keys and equipment. In later games, the dungeon includes
a special "big key" that will unlock the door to battle the dungeon's boss
enemy and open the item chest.
In most Zelda games, the player's HP_or_life_meter is represented by a line of
hearts, each heart typically representing two hit points. At the start of the
game the player only has three hearts; players can increase their max hearts by
finding heart-shaped crystals called "Heart Containers". Full heart containers
are usually received at the end of dungeons and dropped by dungeon bosses.
Smaller "Pieces of Heart" are awarded for completing side quests or found
hidden around the game world in various places, and require a certain number
(usually four) to form a full heart container. Health can be replenished by
picking up hearts left by defeated enemies or destroyed objects, consuming
items such as potions or food, or going to a Great Fairy Fountain to have the
Great Fairy heal Link completely. Occasionally the player will find fairies
hidden in specific locations; these fairies can either heal Link immediately or
be kept in empty bottles, and will revive the player the next time they die.
The games pioneered a number of features that were to become industry
standards. The original Legend of Zelda was the first console game with a save
function that enabled players to stop playing and then resume later. The Legend
of Zelda: Ocarina of Time introduced a targeting system that let the player
lock the camera on to enemy or friendly non-player characters which simplified
3D combat.[citation_needed]
**** Inspiration ****

Shigeru_Miyamoto_GDC_2007.jpg/110px-Shigeru_Miyamoto_GDC_2007.jpg]Shigeru
Miyamoto, series creator, was inspired by the hillsides, forests, and caves
surrounding his childhood home in Sonobe,_Japan.
The Legend of Zelda was principally inspired by Shigeru_Miyamoto's
"explorations" as a young boy in the hillsides, forests, and caves surrounding
his childhood home in Sonobe,_Japan where he ventured into forests with
secluded lakes, caves, and rural villages. According to Miyamoto, one of his
most memorable experiences was the discovery of a cave entrance in the middle
of the woods.[3] After some hesitation, he apprehensively entered the cave, and
explored its depths with the aid of a lantern. Miyamoto has referred to the
creation of the Zelda games as an attempt to bring to life a "miniature garden"
for players to play with in each game of the series.[4]
The story and setting were developed by Takashi_Tezuka. Seeking to create a
fairytale adventure game, Tezuka drew inspirations from fantasy books such as
J._R._R._Tolkien's The_Lord_of_the_Rings.[5][6][7] According to Keiji Terui,
who wrote the backstory in the first game's manual, the location named Death
Mountain was initially a working_title for the legend of the Triforce which was
written with inspirations from the battles of medieval_Europe.[8][9] The Master
Sword was introduced as Excalibur in the French_version of A_Link_to_the_Past,
[10][11] which is regarded as reminiscent to the legend of King_Arthur.[12][7]
Celtic_mythology inspired the name of Link's steed, Epona, based on Epona,
Celtic goddess of fertility.[13][14]
Hearing of American novelist, socialite and painter Zelda_Fitzgerald, Miyamoto
thought the name sounded "pleasant and significant".[15] Paying tribute, he
chose to name the princess after her, and titled it The Legend of Zelda. Link
and the fairy were inspired by Peter_Pan and Tinker_Bell.[16][17] When the
series made the transition to 3D, the combat system of Ocarina of Time was
based on the chanbara (samurai) style of Japanese sword fighting.[18]

_GDC_2007_cropped.jpg/110px-Koji_Kondo_-_GDC_2007_cropped.jpg]Koji_Kondo, the
series's original composer
Games in The Legend of Zelda series frequently feature in-game musical
instruments, particularly in musical puzzles, which are widespread.[19] Often,
instruments trigger game events: for example, the recorder in The Legend of
Zelda can reveal secret areas, as well as warp Link to the dungeon entrances.
This warping with music feature has also been used in A Link to the Past and
Link's Awakening. In Ocarina_of_Time, playing instruments is a core part of the
game, with the player needing to play the instrument through the use of the
game controller to succeed.[20] Ocarina of Time is "[one of the] first
contemporary non-dance title[s] to feature music-making as part of its
gameplay",[21] using music as a heuristic device and requiring the player to
utilise songs to progress in the game[22] ‚Äì a game_mechanic that is also
present in Majora's_Mask.[23]
"The Legend of Zelda Theme" is a recurring piece of music that was created for
the first game. The composer and sound director of the series, Koji_Kondo,
initially planned to use Maurice_Ravel's Bol√©ro as the game's title theme, but
was forced to change it when he learned, late in the game's development cycle,
that the copyright for the orchestral piece had not yet expired. As a result,
Kondo wrote a new arrangement of the overworld theme within one day.[24]
Up until Breath_of_the_Wild, the Legend of Zelda series avoided using voice
acting in speaking roles, relying instead on written dialogue. Series producer
Eiji_Aonuma previously stated that as Link is entirely mute, having the other
characters speak while Link remains silent "would be off-putting".[25] Instead
of theme music for different locations, Breath of the Wild plays natural
ambience around the player as main sounds, in addition to some minimalist piano
music.[26]

The Legend of Zelda takes place predominantly in a medieval Western_Europe-
inspired fantasy_world called Hyrule,[27][28] which has developed a deep
history and wide geography over the series's many releases. Much of the
backstory of the creation of Hyrule was revealed in the games A_Link_to_the
Past, Ocarina_of_Time, The_Wind_Waker, Twilight_Princess, Skyward_Sword, and A
Link_Between_Worlds. Hyrule's principal inhabitants are pointy-eared, elf-like
humanoids called Hylians, which include the player_character, Link, and the
eponymous princess, Zelda.
The fictional universe established by the Zelda games sets the stage for each
adventure. Some games take place in different lands with their own back-
stories. Hytopia is a connected kingdom,[29] Labrynna and Holodrum are
different countries separate from the Kingdom of Hyrule, Termina and Lorule
serve as parallel worlds,[30] and Koholint is an island far away from Hyrule
that appears to be part of a dream.[31]
**** Story ****
[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Trifuerza.svg/220px-
Trifuerza.svg.png]The Triforce is represented as three conjoined golden
triangles.
According to the in-game backstories, the world of Hyrule was created by the
three golden_goddesses: Din, Farore, and Nayru.[32] Before departing, the
goddesses left a sacred artifact called the Triforce, which could grant powers
to the user. It physically manifests itself as three golden triangles in which
each embodies one of the goddesses' virtues: Power, Courage, and Wisdom.[33]
However, because the Triforce has no will of its own and it can not judge
between good and evil, it will grant any wish indiscriminately.[34][35] Because
of this, it was placed within an alternate world called the "Sacred Realm" or
the "Golden Land" until one worthy of its power and has balanced virtues of
Power, Wisdom, and Courage in their heart could obtain it, in its entirety. If
a person is not of a balanced heart, the triforce part that the user mostly
believes in will stay with that person and the remainder will seek out others.
In order to master and control the triforce as a whole, the user must get the
other parts found in other individuals and bring them together to reunite them.
The Sacred Realm can itself be affected by the heart of those who enter it:
those who are pure will make it a paradise, while those who are evil will
transform it into a dark realm.[36]
In Skyward Sword, the Triforce was sought by the Demon King Demise,[37] an
eternal being that had conquered time itself.[38] After a long battle against
the goddess Hylia, guardian of the Triforce, Demise was sealed away within her
temple.[33][39] Hylia, placing the Hylians on a floating island in the sky
called Skyloft to protect them, orchestrated a means to stop the demon from
escaping: creating the Goddess Sword (later becoming the Master Sword) for her
chosen hero[40] and discarding her divinity to be reborn among the people of
Skyloft.[41] In time, Zelda and Link (the reborn Hylia and her predestined
warrior) enacted the goddess's plan and Demise was destroyed, but he vowed that
his rage would be reborn and forever plague those descended from Link and
Zelda.[42] Following the establishment of Hyrule Kingdom, Demise's prophecy
came to fruition in Ocarina_of_Time, when Ganondorf's attempt to get the
Triforce scattered it with him gaining the Triforce of Power. The Triforce of
Wisdom ended up with the Hylian princesses descended from Zelda, each named
after her, while the Triforce of Courage is passed to a youth named Link across
generations. While the Triforces of Power and Wisdom have been part of the
series since the original The Legend of Zelda, it was in Zelda II: The
Adventure of Link that the Triforce of Courage was introduced, being obtained
by Link at the end of his quest. The Triforce, or even a piece of it, is not
always distributed as a whole. Such as in The Wind Waker, Link must find all
the pieces (called Triforce Shards) of the Triforce of Courage before he can
return to Hyrule. Even in the original The Legend of Zelda, Zelda breaks her
Triforce of Wisdom into 8 pieces for Link to find, before she was captured by
Ganon.

The chronology of the Legend of Zelda series was a subject of much debate among
fans until an official timeline was released within the Hyrule_Historia
collector's book, first released in Japan in December 2011.[45][46] Prior to
its release, in a 2003 interview, series creator Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed the
existence of an internal document which connected all the games, with series
producer Eiji Aonuma later revealing in 2010 the confidential nature of this
document, which only Miyamoto himself and the director of each game had access
to.[47][48]
In-game content, marketing material, and developer statements once partially
established a timeline of the released installments: the original_The_Legend_of
Zelda was followed by Zelda_II:_The_Adventure_of_Link as a direct sequel, which
takes place several years later;[49][50] A_Link_to_the_Past is a prequel to the
previous two games,[51][52][53] and is followed by Link's_Awakening;[54][55]
Ocarina_of_Time is a prequel to A Link to the Past and takes the story many
centuries back - according to character designer Satoru Takizawa, it was meant
to implicitly tell the story of the Imprisoning War,[56][57] and was followed
by Majora's_Mask as a direct sequel, set a few months later;[58] Four_Swords,
upon its release, was considered the oldest tale in the series's chronology,
predating Ocarina of Time;[59] The_Wind_Waker takes place in one of the
parallel timelines that emerged from Ocarina of Time, more than a century
later, in the "adult era";[60][61] Four_Swords_Adventures, upon its release,
was considered to be a direct sequel to Four Swords, set sometime after its
events;[59] The_Minish_Cap is a prequel to Four Swords, telling of the origins
of villain Vaati and the creation of the Four Sword;[62] Twilight_Princess
takes place in another of the parallel timelines that emerged from Ocarina of
Time, more than a century later, in the "child era";[60][61] Phantom_Hourglass
is a direct sequel to The Wind Waker,[63] and is followed by Spirit_Tracks,
which is set about a century later on a land far away from the setting of The
Wind Waker.[64] Skyward_Sword precedes The Minish Cap, telling the story of the
creation of the Master Sword.[65][66] A_Link_Between_Worlds takes place six
generations after A Link to the Past, and features the Triforce being reunited,
and Ganon being resurrected;[67] Tri_Force_Heroes is a direct sequel to A Link
Between Worlds, which takes place several years later;[68][69] Breath_of_the
Wild and its direct sequel, Tears_of_the_Kingdom take place after all previous
games in the series, without specifying a direct connection to any of the three
timeline branches.[44]
In the early 2000s, Nintendo of America released a timeline on the official
website of the series as one of the possible interpretation of the events from
all entries released up to that point, featuring a single protagonist named
Link, the "Hero of Time" from its first adventure in Ocarina of Time. It was
followed by Majora's Mask, A Link to the Past, Oracle of Seasons, Oracle of
Ages, the original The Legend of Zelda, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, and
finally Link's Awakening.[70] In 2011, series translator Daniel_Owsen revealed
that, at one point, his coworkers at Nintendo of America and him conceived
another complete timeline and intended to make it available online, but the
Japanese series developers rejected the idea so that the placement of each game
would be kept open to the imagination of the players.[71]
On December 21, 2011, to celebrate 25th anniversary of the series, the Hyrule
Historia art_book was published by Shogakukan, which contained an official
timeline of the fictional chronology of the series up to that point.[45] This
timeline subsequently posits that following Ocarina of Time, it splits into
three alternate routes: in one, Ganon is not defeated, leading into the
Imprisoning War and A Link to the Past, Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages,
Link's Awakening (A Link Between Worlds, Tri Force Heroes, and Echoes of Wisdom
were released after the timeline), The Legend of Zelda and The Adventure of
Link. The second and third, where Ganon is defeated by Link, lead to a split
timeline between his childhood (where Zelda sends him back in time so he can
use the wisdom he has gained to warn young Zelda of the horrifying fate of
Hyrule) and adulthood (where adult Zelda lives on to try and rebuild her
kingdom). His childhood continues with Majora's Mask, followed by Twilight
Princess and Four Swords Adventures. The timeline from his adult life continues
into Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks.[45]
In 2018, Nintendo revealed Breath of the Wild's timeline placement after all
previous games in the series, without specifying a connection to any of the
three timeline branches. Aonuma and Breath of the Wild director Hidemaro
Fujibayashi justified the vague placement with the previous idea of keeping it
open to players' imaginations.[44] Nintendo moved Link's Awakening to take
place before Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages.[44] In 2020, Nintendo
released Hyrule_Warriors:_Age_of_Calamity, a gameplay-wise sequel to the 2014
spin-off game Hyrule_Warriors marketed as a prequel to Breath of the Wild,
being set 100 years before,[72] but the events of Age of Calamity diverged from
the backstory established in Breath of the Wild, creating an alternate timeline
separate from it.[73]
**** Characters ****
Main article: Characters_of_The_Legend_of_Zelda
*** Link ***
Main article: Link_(The_Legend_of_Zelda)
The central protagonist of The Legend of Zelda series, Link is the name of
various young male Hylians who characteristically wear a green tunic and a
pointed cap, and are the bearers of the Triforce_of_Courage. In most games, the
player can give Link a different name before the start of the adventure, and he
will be referred by that given name throughout by the non-player_characters
(NPCs). Miyamoto said in a 2002 interview that he named the protagonist "Link"
because the character is/was supposed to be the "link" between the player and
the game world. The various Links each have a special title, such as "Hero of
Time", "Hero of Winds" or "Hero of the Wild". Like many silent_protagonists in
video games, Link does not speak, only producing grunts, yells, etc., but he is
not mute - dialogue from him is referenced second-hand by in-game characters,
despite not being seen or heard by the player. Link is depicted as a silent
protagonist so that the audience is able to have their own thoughts as to how
their Link would answer the characters instead of him having scripted
responses.
*** Princess Zelda ***
Main article: Princess_Zelda
Princess Zelda is the princess of Hyrule and the guardian of the Triforce_of
Wisdom. Her name is present in many of her female ancestors and descendants.
While most games require Link to save Zelda from Ganon, she sometimes plays a
supporting role in battle, using magical powers and weapons such as Light
Arrows to aid Link. With the exception of the CD-i games, she was not playable
in the main series until Spirit Tracks, where she becomes a spirit and can
possess a Phantom Knight that can be controlled by the player. Zelda appears
under various other aliases and alter_egos, including Sheik (in Ocarina_of
Time) and Tetra (in The_Wind_Waker and Phantom_Hourglass). In Skyward Sword, it
is revealed that the Zelda of that game is a reincarnation of the goddess
Hylia, whose power flows through the royal bloodline. The name "Zelda" derives
from the American novelist Zelda_Fitzgerald.[74]
*** Ganon ***
Main article: Ganon
Ganon, also known as Ganondorf in his humanoid form, is the main antagonist and
the final boss in the majority of The Legend of Zelda games. In the series,
Ganondorf is the leader of a race of desert brigands called the Gerudo, which
consists entirely of female warriors save for one man born every one hundred
years. He is significantly taller than other human NPCs, but his looks vary
between games, often taking the form of a monstrous anthropomorphic boar. His
specific motives vary from game to game, but most often his plans include him
kidnapping Princess Zelda and planning to achieve domination of Hyrule and
presumably the world beyond it. To this end, he seeks the Triforce, a powerful
magical relic. He often possesses a portion of the Triforce called the Triforce
of Power, which gives him great strength, but it is often not enough to
accomplish his ends, leading him to hunt the remaining Triforce pieces. Unlike
Link, Zelda, and most other recurring characters, he is actually the same
person in every game, with the exception of Four Swords Adventures, where he is
a reincarnation of the original. In each game the battles with him are
different and he fights using different styles. The game Skyward_Sword
indicates that Ganon is a reincarnation of an evil deity known as Demise.

**** 1986‚Äì1997: 2D origins ****
[An_overhead_view_of_a_young_boy_in_a_green_tunic_battling_creatures.]The
Legend_of_Zelda, released in 1986 for the Nintendo_Entertainment_System, was
the first game in the series - it featured an open_world, and nonlinear
gameplay.
The_Legend_of_Zelda, the first game of the series, was first released in Japan
in February 1986, on the Famicom_Disk_System.[75] A cartridge version for the
Nintendo_Entertainment_System, using battery-backed memory, was released in
1987 in the United States on August 22, and in Europe on November 27. The game
features a "Second Quest", accessible either upon completing the game, or by
registering one's name as "ZELDA" when starting a new quest. The "Second Quest"
features different dungeons and item placement, and more difficult enemies.[76]
A modified version of the original Famicom game, BS_Zelda_no_Densetsu, was
released for the Super_Famicom's satellite-based expansion, Satellaview, in
August 1995, in Japan. A second Satellaview game, BS Zelda no Densetsu MAP2 was
released for the Satellaview in December the same year. Both games featured
rearranged dungeons, an altered overworld, and new voice-acted plot-lines.[77]
The second game, Zelda_II:_The_Adventure_of_Link, was released for the Famicom
Disk_System in Japan in January 1987,[75] and for the Nintendo_Entertainment
System in Europe in September and North America in December 1988. The game
exchanged the top-down_perspective for side-scrolling (though the top-down
point of view was retained for overworld areas), and introduced RPG elements
(such as experience_points) not used previously or thereafter in the series.
The Legend of Zelda and Zelda II were released in gold-colored cartridges
instead of the console's regular grey cartridges. Both were re-released in the
final years of the Nintendo_Entertainment_System with grey cartridges.[78]
Four years later, A_Link_to_the_Past returned to the top-down view (under a 3/
4_perspective), and added the concept of an alternate dimension, the Dark
World. The game was released for the Super_NES in November 1991.[75] A
downloadable version of A Link to the Past[79] and an exclusive modified
version called BS_Zelda_no_Densetsu_Inishie_no_Sekiban[80] were released on the
Satellaview in Japan in March 1997. A Link to the Past was re-released for the
Game_Boy_Advance in 2002. The SNES version was later re-released on the Wii
Virtual Console in January 2007, on the Wii U Virtual Console, and on Nintendo
Switch Online.
Three_Zelda-themed_LCD_games were created between 1989 and 1992. The Zelda
version of Nintendo's Game_&_Watch series was released first in August 1989 as
a dual-screen handheld_electronic_game similar in appearance to today's
Nintendo_DS. It was re-released in 1998 as a Toymax, Inc. Mini Classic and was
later included as an unlockable extra in Game_&_Watch_Gallery_4, a 2002
compilation for the Game_Boy_Advance. While the Game & Watch Zelda was
developed in-house by Nintendo, the subsequent two LCD games were developed by
third parties under license by Nintendo. In October 1989, The_Legend_of_Zelda
was developed by Nelsonic as part of its Game Watch line. This game was an
actual digital watch with primitive gameplay based on the original Legend of
Zelda. In 1992, Epoch_Co. developed Zelda_no_Densetsu:_Kamigami_no_Triforce for
its Barcode_Battler¬†II console. The game employed card-scanning technology
similar to the later-released Nintendo_e-Reader.
The next game, Link's_Awakening, for Nintendo's Game_Boy, is the first Zelda
for a handheld, and the first set outside Hyrule and to exclude Princess Zelda.
Link's Awakening was re-released, in full color, as a launch game for the Game
Boy Color in 1998 as Link's Awakening DX. This remaster features additions such
as an extra color-based dungeon and a photo shop that allows interaction with
the Game_Boy_Printer. Link's Awakening DX was released on the 3DS' Virtual
Console in June 2011. An HD_remake_of_Link's_Awakening was released for the
Nintendo Switch in 2019.[81][82]
Three_video_games were developed and released on CD-i in the early 1990s as a
product of a compromise between Philips and Nintendo, after the companies
failed to develop a CD-ROM peripheral for the Super NES. Created independently
with no observation by or influence from Nintendo, the games are Link:_The
Faces_of_Evil,_Zelda:_The_Wand_of_Gamelon, and later, Zelda's_Adventure.
Nintendo never acknowledged them in the Zelda timeline, and they are considered
to be in a separate, self-contained canon. These games are widely acknowledged
to be the worst installments in the series, though have since gained a cult
following in the form of internet_memes.[83]

for the Nintendo_64, was the first 3D game in the series.
After five years without a new game, the series made the transition to 3D with
Ocarina_of_Time for the Nintendo_64, which was released in November 1998. This
game, initially known as Zelda 64, retains the core gameplay of the previous 2D
games, and was very successful commercially and critically, considered by many
critics and gamers to be the best_video_game_of_all_time, and ranking highly on
IGN and EGM's "greatest games of all time" lists, as well as scoring perfect
scores in several video game publications.[84] In February 2006, it was ranked
by Nintendo_Power as the best game released for a Nintendo console.[85] The
game was originally developed for the poorly selling, Japanese-only 64DD, but
was converted to cartridge format when the 64DD hardware was delayed.[86] A new
gameplay mechanic, lock-on targeting, is used in the game, which focuses the
camera on a nearby target and alters the player's actions relative to that
target.[87] Such mechanics allow precise sword fighting in a 3D space. The game
heavily uses context-sensitive button play, which enabled the player to control
various actions with Link using only one button on the Nintendo 64's
controller. Each action was handled slightly differently but all used the 'A'
button to perform. For instance, standing next to a block and pressing 'A' made
Link grab it (enabling him to push/pull it), but moving forwards into a block
and pressing 'A' allowed Link to climb the block. The game featured the first
appearance of Link's horse, Epona, allowing Link to travel quickly across land
and fire arrows from horseback. Those who preordered the game received a gold-
colored cartridge in a limited edition box with a golden plastic card affixed,
reading "Collector's Edition".[88] In some stores that had this "Collector's
Edition" quickly sell out, a small and rare Zelda pin was given instead. It is
the sword and shield emblem with "Zelda" written on it. Very few of them are
known to remain. Ocarina of Time was re-released on the GameCube in 2002, when
it was offered as a pre-order_incentive for The Wind Waker in the U.S., Canada
and Japan.[89] It includes the cancelled 64DD expansion for Ocarina of Time
known as Ura Zelda during development. Named Ocarina_of_Time_Master_Quest, the
game was given reorganized dungeon layouts for greater difficulty.[89][90]
Europe continued to receive this "Two-Game Bonus Disc" free in every copy of
The Wind Waker, except for the discounted Player's_Choice version. Ocarina of
Time was available through the Wii's Virtual_Console service.[91] Nintendo re-
released it for the Wii_U Virtual Console in July 2015. Ocarina_of_Time_3D for
the 3DS, featuring remade graphics and stereoscopic 3D, was released in mid-
June 2011. Ocarina of Time has been made available on the higher tier of
Nintendo_Switch_Online in HD resolution.
Ocarina of Time's follow-up, Majora's_Mask, was released in April 2000. It uses
the same 3D game_engine as the previous game,[92] and added a time-based
concept, in which Link, the protagonist, relives the events of three days as
many times as needed to complete the game's objectives. It was originally
called Zelda Gaiden,[93] a Japanese title that translates as Zelda Side_story.
Gameplay changed significantly; in addition to the time-limit, Link can use
masks to transform into creatures with unique abilities. While Majora's Mask
retains the graphical style of Ocarina of Time, it is also a departure,
particularly in its atmosphere. It features motion-blur, unlike its
predecessor. The game is darker in tone,[92] dealing with death and tragedy in
a manner not previously seen in the series, and has a sense of impending doom,
as a large moon slowly descends upon the land of Termina to destroy all life.
All copies of Majora's_Mask are gold cartridges. A limited "Collector's
Edition" lenticular cartridge label was offered as the pre-order_incentive.
Copies of the game that are not collector's editions feature a normal sticker
cartridge label. Majora's Mask was available on the Wii and Wii U Virtual
Console catalogues. The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Majora's_Mask_3D was released for 3DS
in North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia in February 2015. The Nintendo
64 version was added to Nintendo Switch Online in February 2022; with this, all
of the 3D games in the series have been re-released in HD resolution.
Oracle_of_Seasons_and_Oracle_of_Ages were released simultaneously for the Game
Boy_Color in 2001, and interact using passwords[94] or a Game_Link_Cable.[95]
After one game has been completed, the player is given a password that allows
the other game to be played as a sequel.[94] They were developed by Flagship in
conjunction with Nintendo, with supervision from Miyamoto. After the team
experimented with porting the original The Legend of Zelda to the Game Boy
Color, they decided to make an original trilogy[96] to be called the "Triforce
Series".[97] When the password system linking the three games proved too
troublesome, the concept was reduced to two games at Miyamoto's suggestion.[98]
These two games became Oracle of Ages, which is more puzzle-based, and Oracle
of Seasons, which is more action-oriented.[99] Both titles were later released
on the 3DS Virtual Console and Nintendo Switch Online.

The_Legend_of_Zelda_Four_Swords_screenshot.png]Four_Swords, released in 2002
for the Game_Boy_Advance, was the first multiplayer_game in the series, and
introduced a new cartoon art style.
The Game_Boy_Advance release of A Link to the Past in 2002 featured a new game,
Four_Swords,[75] the first multiplayer Zelda. This game introduced Toon_Link, a
name first used in Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl to refer to cartoon-based visual
designs of Link. Four Swords Anniversary Edition[100] was released in September
2011, as free DSiWare available until February 20, 2012.

The_Legend_of_Zelda_The_Wind_Waker_screenshot.jpg]The_Wind_Waker, released in
2002 for the GameCube, was the first game in the series featuring cel_shading.
When Nintendo revealed the GameCube on August 24, 2000, the day before
Nintendo's Space_World 2000 exposition,[101] a software demonstration showed a
realistically styled real-time duel between Ganondorf and Link. Fans and the
media speculated that the battle might be from a Zelda game in development at
the time.[102] At Space World 2001, Nintendo showed a cel-shaded Zelda game,
later released as The_Wind_Waker in December 2002. Due to poor reception,
nothing further was shown until a playable demonstration was ready. Miyamoto
felt The Wind Waker would "extend Zelda's reach to all ages".[103][104] The
gameplay centers on controlling wind with a baton called the "Wind Waker" and
sailing a small boat around an island-filled ocean, retaining similar gameplay
mechanics as the previous 3D games in the series. The_Legend_of_Zelda:
Collector's_Edition, released for the GameCube in 2003,[105] included the
original The Legend of Zelda, Zelda II, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, and a
demo of The Wind Waker. The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Wind_Waker_HD was released for
Wii U in 2013.
Four_Swords_Adventures was released for the GameCube in early 2004 in Japan and
America, and January 2005 in Europe. Based on the handheld Four_Swords, Four
Swords Adventures was another deviation from previous Zelda gameplay, focusing
on level-based and multiplayer gameplay. The game contains 24 levels and a map
screen; there is no connecting overworld. For multiplayer features, each player
must use a Game Boy Advance system linked to the GameCube via a Nintendo
GameCube_‚Äì_Game_Boy_Advance_link_cable. The game features a single-player
campaign, in which using a Game Boy Advance is optional. Four Swords Adventures
includes two gameplay modes: "Hyrulean Adventure", with a plot and gameplay
similar to other Zelda games, and "Shadow Battle", in which multiple Links,
played by multiple players, battle each other. The Japanese and Korean versions
include an exclusive third segment, "Navi Trackers" (originally designed as the
stand-alone game "Tetra's Trackers"), which contains spoken dialogue for most
of the characters, unlike other games in The Legend of Zelda series.
In November 2004 in Japan and Europe, and January 2005 in America, Nintendo
released The_Minish_Cap for the Game_Boy_Advance. In The Minish Cap Link can
shrink in size using a mystical, sentient hat named Ezlo. While shrunk, he can
see previously explored parts of a dungeon from a different perspective, and
enter areas through otherwise-impassable openings. It was later released on the
Wii U Virtual Console.
**** 2006‚Äì2011: Motion and touch-based swordplay ****
[A_boy_in_a_green_tunic_holds_a_shield_while_swinging_his_sword_towards_an
enemy.]Twilight_Princess was the first game in the series with motion_controls,
in which the player controls Link's sword using the Wii_Remote (GameCube
version pictured).
In November 2006, Twilight_Princess was released as the first Zelda game on the
Wii, and later in December as the last Nintendo-published game for the
GameCube, the console for which it was originally developed. The Wii version
features motion controls and a reversed world where everything that is in the
west on the GameCube is in the east on the Wii. The display is mirrored in
order to make Link right-handed to make use of the Wii_Remote feel more natural
for the majority of players. The game chronicles the struggle of a young adult
Link to confront the troubles of the "Twilight Realm", a mysterious force that
appears around and interacts with Hyrule. When he enters this realm, he is
transformed into a wolf, and loses the ability to use his sword, shield or
other items, but gains other abilities such as sharpened senses from his new
form. Twilight Princess includes an incarnation of Link's horse, Epona, for
fast transportation, and features mounted battle scenarios including boss
battles that were not seen in previous games. Twilight Princess diverted from
the cel-shading of Wind Waker, integrating graphics featuring more detailed
textures, giving the game a darker atmosphere. The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight
Princess_HD released for Wii U in 2016.[106]
At 2006 Game_Developers_Conference, a new title Phantom_Hourglass for the
Nintendo_DS was shown. It revealed traditional top-down Zelda gameplay
optimised for the DS's features, with a cel-shaded 3D graphical style similar
to The Wind Waker for Gamecube. The game is a direct sequel to The Wind Waker.
[107] Phantom Hourglass was released in June 2007, for Japan and October for
North America and Europe. It was later released on the Wii U Virtual Console.
The next Legend of Zelda game for the DS, Spirit_Tracks, was released in
December 2009. In this game, the "spirit tracks", railroads which chain an
ancient evil, are disappearing from Hyrule. Zelda and Link go to the 'Spirit
Tower' (the ethereal point of convergence for the tracks) to find out why, but
villains steal Zelda's body for the resurrection of the Demon King. Rendered
disembodied, Zelda is left a spirit, and only Link (and a certain few sages)
can see her. Together they go on a quest to restore the spirit tracks, defeat
the Demon King, and return Zelda to her body. Using a modified engine of that
used in Phantom_Hourglass, the notably new feature in this game is that the
Phantom Guardians seen in Phantom Hourglass are, through a series of events,
periodically controllable. It was the first time in the series that both Link
and Zelda work together on the quest. It was later released on the Wii U
Virtual Console.
A new Zelda game for Wii was in development since the end of 2000s.[108] The
new title was revealed at E3_2010 as Skyward_Sword, but its release was delayed
to 2011.[109] The game, the earliest in the Legend of Zelda timeline, reveals
the origins of Hyrule, Ganon (here known as Demise), and many elements featured
in previous games; it uses Wii's MotionPlus feature as well. It was released in
November 2011; the first run included a 25th Anniversary CD of fully
orchestrated music from various Zelda games, including Skyward Sword. It was
made available for download on Wii U in September 2016. An_HD_remaster, with
optional button-only controls, was released for Nintendo Switch in 2021.[110]
**** 2013‚Äìpresent: Open-world emphasis ****
In 2013, Nintendo released A_Link_Between_Worlds for the Nintendo_3DS, a sequel
to A Link to the Past.[111][112] Progression is more open-ended than previous
titles, with the possibility of completing many of the game's dungeons in any
order. Certain dungeon obstacles require the use of rented or purchased items.
Tri_Force_Heroes, a cooperative multiplayer game, was released for the 3DS in
October 2015.[113] It features the same Link as A Link Between Worlds but lacks
open-world gameplay.
[An_in-game_screenshot_of_the_protagonist_Link,_paragliding_across_a_vast
world.]Breath_of_the_Wild, released in 2017 for the Wii_U and Nintendo_Switch,
returned the series to fully open-world and nonlinear_gameplay.
While Nintendo had showcased a Wii U demo reel at E3_2011 that depicted Link
fighting a monster in HD[114] and the first original HD Zelda game was
scheduled for a 2015 release, it was delayed.[115] The title was finally
revealed at E3_2016 as Breath_of_the_Wild, and the game was released in March
2017, as the last Nintendo-published game for the Wii U and a launch title for
the Nintendo_Switch.[116][117] Similar to the original The Legend of Zelda,
players are given little instruction and can explore the world freely. The
world is designed to encourage exploration and experimentation and the main
story quest can be completed in a nonlinear fashion.
A Breath of the Wild sequel, Tears_of_the_Kingdom, was released on the Switch
in May 2023.[118][119] New to Tears of the Kingdom are the battery-powered
Zonai devices, which the player can use for combat, propulsion, exploration,
and more. The game also features the new abilities to fuse materials together,
ascend through ceilings, reverse objects' movement through time, and autobuild
structures.
Echoes_of_Wisdom, which features Zelda as the main protagonist, was released in
September 2024.[120]
***** Other games *****
**** Cancelled games ****
Throughout the lifespan of The Legend of Zelda series, a number of games
(including main series games as well as re-releases and spin-offs) in varying
states of completeness have had their releases cancelled. Perhaps the earliest
of these was Gottlieb's The Legend of Zelda Pinball Machine (cancelled in
1993). After securing a license from Nintendo to produce two Nintendo-
franchise-based pinball machines, pinball designer Jon Norris was tasked with
designing the table. Before it was completed, Gottlieb decided to repurpose the
game with an American_Gladiators theme. Licensing for this version ultimately
fell through and the game was released as simply Gladiators in November 1993.
[121]
In 1998, Nintendo cancelled Ura_Zelda, the Ocarina_of_Time expansion disk for
the 64DD[122] due to poor sales figures for the 64DD peripheral.[123] In 2002,
Nintendo released a GameCube bonus disc called The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of
Time_Master_Quest.[122] It contains emulated versions of Ocarina of Time and
Ocarina of Time Master Quest, which Aonuma and Miyamoto each confirmed is Ura
Zelda.[123][124]
In 2001, under license from Nintendo, Capcom cancelled the release of The
Legend of Zelda: Mystical Seed of Courage for Game_Boy_Color. Working with
Capcom's subsidiary Flagship, Yoshiki_Okamoto was originally tasked with
designing a series of three Zelda games for the Game_Boy_Color.[125] Referred
to as the "Triforce Series",[126] the games were known as The Legend of Zelda:
The Mysterious Acorn: Chapter of Power, Chapter of Wisdom, and Chapter of
Courage in Japan[127] and The Legend of Zelda: Mystical Seed of Power, Mystical
Seed of Wisdom, and Mystical Seed of Courage in the US.[128] The games were to
interact using a password_system,[126] but the limitations of this system and
the difficulty of coordinating three games proved too complicated, so the team
scaled back to two games at Miyamoto's suggestion.[129][130] The_Legend_of
Zelda:_Oracle_of_Seasons was adapted from Mystical Seed of Power, The_Legend_of
Zelda:_Oracle_of_Ages was adapted from Mystical Seed of Wisdom, and Mystical
Seed of Courage was cancelled.[126]
Before its 2006 release, both Link and Samus from the Metroid series were
planned to be playable characters for the Wii version of Marvel:_Ultimate
Alliance, but they did not make the final release because they were not Marvel
characters.[131]
In 2011, an unnamed Zelda 25th Anniversary Compilation was cancelled. To
celebrate the 25th anniversary of the series, Nintendo of America originally
had planned to release a compilation of games together for the Wii, similar to
the collector's edition disc released for the GameCube in 2003. Nintendo of
Japan's president Satoru Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto decided against releasing
it, believing it would be too similar to the Super Mario 25th Anniversary
collection released in 2010.[132]
Retro_Studios had two Zelda games in development. One was an untitled game
starring a Sheikah in a story that explores the origins of the Master_Sword.
[133][134] Another one was titled Heroes of Hyrule and it starred Goron, Zora,
and Rito who set out to rescue Link.[134][135]
**** Spin-off games ****
As the franchise has grown in popularity, several games have been released that
are set within or star a minor character from the universe of The Legend of
Zelda but are not directly connected to the main The Legend of Zelda series.
Both map versions of the game BS_Zelda_no_Densetsu for the Satellaview
(released in August and December 1995) could be considered spin-offs due to the
fact that they star the "Hero of Light" (portrayed by either the Satellaview's
male or female avatar) as opposed to Link as the protagonist of Hyrule.
[citation_needed] A third Satellaview game released in March 1997, BS_Zelda_no
Densetsu_Inishie_no_Sekiban (BS The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets)
could also be considered a spin-off for the same reason.[citation_needed] Other
spin-off games include Freshly-Picked_Tingle's_Rosy_Rupeeland for the Nintendo
DS, an RPG released in September 2006 in Japan (Summer of 2007 in the UK) to
star supporting character Tingle. A second Tingle game is Tingle's_Balloon
Fight_DS for the Nintendo DS. Here Tingle again stars in this spin-off arcade
style platformer, released in April 2007 only in Japan and available solely to
Platinum Club Nintendo members.
In addition to games in which Link does not star as the protagonist, games such
as the shooter game, Link's_Crossbow_Training (for the Wii), have been
considered spin-offs due to the lack of a traditional "Save Hyrule" plot-line.
Released in November 2007 as a bundle with the Wii_Zapper, this game allows
players to assume the identity of Link as he progresses through a series of
tests to perfect his crossbow marksmanship. Color_Changing_Tingle's_Love
Balloon_Trip was released in Japan in 2009 as a sequel to Freshly-Picked
Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland.
Hyrule_Warriors, a crossover game combining the setting of Nintendo's The
Legend of Zelda series and the gameplay of Tecmo_Koei's Dynasty_Warriors
series, was released in North America in September 2014 for Wii U. Hyrule
Warriors_Legends, a version for the Nintendo_3DS containing more content and
gameplay modifications, was released in March 2016.
To commemorate the launch of the My_Nintendo loyalty program in March 2016,
Nintendo released My_Nintendo_Picross:_The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess,
a Picross puzzle_game developed by Jupiter for download to the Nintendo 3DS.
[136][137]
Cadence_of_Hyrule, developed by Brace Yourself Games and released in June 2019,
is an officially licensed crossover of Zelda with Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer.
[138]
Hyrule_Warriors:_Age_of_Calamity, developed by Koei_Tecmo, shares the hack-and-
slash style of the spin-off game Hyrule_Warriors.[139] Age of Calamity was
released in November 2020.[140][72]
A new Zelda-themed variant of Vermin was included on the limited edition Game_&
Watch:_The_Legend_of_Zelda unit, released in 2021. This special edition of the
Game & Watch also included The Legend of Zelda, The Adventure of Link, and
Link's Awakening.

The Legend of Zelda series has received outstanding levels of acclaim from
critics and the public. Ocarina_of_Time, Skyward_Sword, Breath_of_the_Wild and
Tears_of_the_Kingdom have each received a perfect 10/10 score by British Edge
magazine.[210] All four plus Wind_Waker also received a 40/40 score (10/10 by
four reviewers) by Japanese Famitsu magazine,[211][212] making Zelda one of the
few series with multiple perfect scores. Ocarina of Time was even listed by
Guinness_World_Records as the highest-rated video game in history, citing its
Metacritic score of 99 out of 100.[213] Computer_and_Video_Games awarded The
Wind Waker and Twilight_Princess a score of 10/10.[214][215] A_Link_to_the_Past
has won Gold Award from Electronic_Gaming_Monthly. In Nintendo_Power's Top 200
countdown in 2004, Ocarina of Time took first place, and seven other Zelda
games placed in the top 40.[216] Twilight Princess was named Game_of_the_Year
by X-Play, GameTrailers, 1UP, Electronic_Gaming_Monthly, Spacey_Awards, Game
Informer, GameSpy, Nintendo_Power, IGN, and many other websites. The editors of
review aggregator websites GameRankings, IGN and Metacritic have all given
Ocarina of Time their highest aggregate scores.[217] Game_Informer has awarded
The Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword, A Link Between Worlds and
Breath of the Wild with scores of 10/10. Phantom_Hourglass was named DS Game of
the Year by IGN and GameSpy.[218][219] Airing in December 2011, Spike TV's
annual Video Game Awards gave the series the first ever "Hall of Fame Award",
which Miyamoto accepted in person.[220] Ocarina_of_Time and its use of melodic
themes to identify different game regions has been called a reverse of Richard
Wagner's use of leitmotifs to identify characters and themes.[221] Ocarina of
Time was so well received that sales increased for real ocarinas.[222] IGN
praised the music of Majora's Mask for its brilliance despite its heavy use of
MIDI. It has been ranked the seventh-greatest game by Electronic_Gaming
Monthly, whereas Ocarina of Time was ranked eighth.[223][224] The series won
GameFAQs Best Series Ever competition.[225]
As of September 2024, The Legend of Zelda franchise has sold over 156.1 million
copies,[n_9] with the original The_Legend_of_Zelda being the fourth best-
selling NES game of all time.[230][231] The series was ranked as the 64th top
game (collectively) by Next_Generation in 1996.[232] In 1999, Next_Generation
listed the Zelda series as number 1 on their "Top 50 Games of All Time",
commenting that Zelda series had always more gameplay and innovations than most
other titles in their series.[233] According to British film magazine Empire,
with "the most vividly-realised world and the most varied game-play of any game
on any console, Zelda is a solid bet for the best game series ever".[234]
The Legend of Zelda franchise has garnered the most Game_of_the_Year
nominations in the history of the Academy_of_Interactive_Arts_&_Sciences'
D.I.C.E._Awards with eight (Ocarina_of_Time,[235] Majora's_Mask,[236] The_Wind
Waker,[237] Twilight_Princess,[238] Skyward_Sword,[239] A_Link_Between_Worlds,
[240] Breath_of_the_Wild,[241] and Tears_of_the_Kingdom[242]); two of them,
Ocarina_of_Time[235] and Breath_of_the_Wild,[243] would go on to win the top
honor during their respective awards ceremonies.
***** Legacy *****
Multiple members of the game industry have expressed how Zelda games have
impacted them, including Rockstar_Games founder and Grand_Theft_Auto director,
Dan_Houser, who said that Zelda and Mario games on Nintendo_64 greatly
influenced them in developing Grand Theft Auto series, as well in other 3D
games in general.[244] Rockstar founder and Grand Theft Auto director Sam
Houser also cited the influence of Zelda, describing Grand_Theft_Auto_III as
"Zelda meets Goodfellas".[245] ≈åkami director Hideki_Kamiya (Capcom,
PlatinumGames) said that he has been influenced by The Legend of Zelda series
in developing the game, citing A_Link_to_the_Past as his favorite game of all
time.[246] Soul_Reaver and Uncharted director, Amy_Hennig (Crystal_Dynamics and
Naughty_Dog), cited Zelda as inspiration for the Legacy_of_Kain series, noting
A Link to the Past's influence on Blood_Omen and Ocarina of Time's influence on
Soul_Reaver.[247] Soul Reaver and Uncharted creator, Richard Lemarchand
(Crystal Dynamics and Naughty Dog), also cited A Link to the Past's approach to
combining gameplay with storytelling as inspiration for Soul Reaver.[248] Wing
Commander and Star_Citizen director, Chris_Roberts (Origin_Systems and Cloud
Imperium_Games), cited Zelda as an influence on his action_role-playing_game,
Times_of_Lore.[249]
Dark_Souls series creator Hidetaka_Miyazaki named A Link To The Past as one of
his favorite role-playing_video_games.[250] Miyazaki also described The Legend
of Zelda as a sort of textbook for 3D action_games.[251] Ico director Fumito
Ueda cited Zelda as an influence on Shadow_of_the_Colossus.[252] Peter_Molyneux
(Lionhead_Studios and Microsoft_Studios) stated that the Twilight Princess is
one of his favorite games and an influence for the Fable series.[253]
Darksiders director David_Adams (Vigil_Games) cited Zelda as an influence on
his work.[254] Prince_of_Persia and Assassin's_Creed director Raphael Lacoste
cited The Wind Waker as an influence on Assassin's_Creed_IV:_Black_Flag.[255]
CD_Projekt_Red cited the Zelda series as an influence on The_Witcher_3:_Wild
Hunt.[256] Majora's Mask served as the primary influence on Alex_Hall's web
series Ben_Drowned.[257] Final_Fantasy and The_3rd_Birthday director Hajime
Tabata cited Ocarina of Time as inspiration for the open_world of Final_Fantasy
XV.[258]
**** Cross-overs ****
The Legend of Zelda series has crossed over into other Nintendo and third-party
video games, most prominently in the Super_Smash_Bros. series of fighting games
published by Nintendo. Link appears as a fighter in Super_Smash_Bros. for the
Nintendo_64, the first entry in the series, and is part of the roster in all
subsequent releases in the series as well. Zelda (who is able to transform into
Sheik as well), Ganondorf, and Young Link (the child version of Link from
Ocarina_of_Time) were added to the player roster for Super_Smash_Bros._Melee,
and appeared in all subsequent releases except for "Young Link" (who is later
replaced by "Toon Link" from The Wind Waker, in subsequent releases Super_Smash
Bros._Brawl and Super_Smash_Bros._for_Nintendo_3DS_and_Wii_U). Both Young Link
and Toon Link appear in the fifth installment, Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate.
Other elements from the series, such as locations and items, are also included
throughout the Smash Bros. series. Outside of the series, Nintendo allowed for
the use of Link as a playable character exclusively in the GameCube release of
Namco's fighting game Soulcalibur_II.[259]
    * Link, using a design based on Skyward_Sword, appears as a playable
      character in Mario_Kart_8 via downloadable_content (DLC), along with a
      "Hyrule Circuit" racetrack themed on The Legend of Zelda series.[260] The
      first pack is named after the series. In a post-launch update for Mario
      Kart_8_Deluxe, Link and his vehicle received alternate styles based on
      Breath of the Wild.[261]
    * In the Wii_U version of Sonic_Lost_World, a DLC stage based on The Legend
      of Zelda series was released in March 2014, named "The Legend of Zelda
      Zone". It was built around the core gameplay mechanics of Sonic Lost
      World, with some elements from the Zelda series, including a heart-based
      vitality meter, rupee collection, and a miniature dungeon to explore.

*** TV series ***
See also: The_Super_Mario_Bros._Super_Show!_¬ß¬†Format
A 13-episode American animated TV series, adapted by DiC and distributed by
Viacom_Enterprises, aired in 1989.[263] The animated Zelda shorts were
broadcast each Friday, instead of the usual Super_Mario_Bros. cartoon which was
aired during the rest of the week.[264][265] The series loosely follows the two
NES Zelda games (the original The Legend of Zelda and The Adventure of Link),
mixing settings and characters from those games with original creations.[266]
The show's older incarnations of both Link and Zelda appeared in various
episodes of Captain_N:_The_Game_Master during its second season.[267]
A live-action television series had been in development around 2015, as
reported from an anonymous Netflix employee to The_Wall_Street_Journal. The
program was a joint effort between Netflix and Nintendo, and was said to be
aimed as a family-friendly version of Game_of_Thrones.[268] Further details of
this series went sparse until 2021 when Adam_Conover gave an interview
regarding his College_Humor period. There, the College Humor team had been
planning a skit that would have combined Star_Fox with Fantastic_Mr._Fox and
had even had talked to Miyamoto on the project. Conover said that they were
told about a month into the project that Nintendo had requested they stop all
work on the project as a result of the leak related to the live-action Zelda
show; Nintendo, already protective of its IP, had pulled many external projects
including the live-action show.[269]
*** Print media ***
Valiant_Comics released a short series of comics featuring characters and
settings from the Zelda cartoon as part of their Nintendo_Comics_System line.
Manga_adaptations_of_many_entries_in_the_series, including A Link to the Past,
Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages, Four
Swords Adventures, The Minish Cap, Phantom Hourglass, and Twilight Princess
have been produced under license from Nintendo, primarily written and drawn by
Japanese artist duo Akira_Himekawa. These adaptations do not strictly follow
the plot of the games from which they are based and may contain additional
story elements.
A number of official books, novels, and gamebooks have been released based on
the series as well. The earliest was Moblin's Magic Spear, published in 1989 by
Western Publishing under their Golden Books Family Entertainment division and
written by Jack C. Harris. It took place sometime during the first game. Two
gamebooks were published as part of the Nintendo_Adventure_Books series by
Archway, both of which were written by Matt Wayne. The first was The Crystal
Trap (which focuses more on Zelda) and the second was The Shadow Prince. Both
were released in 1992. A novel based on Ocarina of Time was released in 1999,
written by Jason R. Rich and published by Sybex Inc. under their Pathways to
Adventure series. Another two gamebooks were released as part of the You_Decide
on_the_Adventure series published by Scholastic. The first book was based on
Oracle of Seasons and was released in 2001. The second, based on Oracle of
Ages, was released in 2002. Both were written by Craig Wessel. In 2006,
Scholastic released a novel as part of their Nintendo Heroes series, Link and
the Portal of Doom. It was written by Tracey West and was set shortly after the
events of Ocarina of Time.
In 2011, to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the series, an art_book was
published exclusively in Japan under the name Hyrule_Historia by Shogakukan. It
contains concept art from the series's conception to the release of Skyward
Sword in 2011 and multiple essays about the production of the games, as well as
an overarching timeline of the series. It also includes a prequel manga to
Skyward Sword by Akira Himekawa. The book received an international release by
publisher Dark_Horse_Comics in January 2013;[270] it took the number one spot
on Amazon's sales chart, taking the spot away from E._L._James's 50_Shades_of
Grey trilogy.[271] Dark Horse released The Legend of Zelda: Art & Artifacts, a
follow-up art book to Hyrule Historia containing additional artwork and
interviews,[272][273] in North America and Europe in February 2017.[274]
*** Music ***
Taking place in Cologne, Germany, on September 23, 2010, the video game music
concert Symphonic_Legends focused on music from Nintendo and, among others,
featured games such as The Legend of Zelda. Following an intermission, the
second half of the concert was entirely dedicated to an expansive symphonic
poem dedicated to the series. The 35-minute epic tells the story of Link's
evolution from child to hero.[275][276]
To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the series in 2011, Nintendo commissioned
an original symphony, The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Symphony_of_the_Goddesses. The show
was originally performed in the fall of 2011 in Los Angeles and consists of
live performances of much of the music from the series.[277] It has since been
scheduled for 18 shows so far throughout the United States and Canada.[277]
[278] Nintendo released a CD, The Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversary Special
Orchestra CD. Featuring eight tracks from live performances of the symphony,
the CD is included alongside the special edition of The Legend of Zelda:
Skyward Sword for the Wii. Nintendo later celebrated The Legend of Zelda's 30th
anniversary with an album which was released in Japan in February 2017.[279]
*** Merchandise ***
The Legend of Zelda-themed Monopoly board game was released in the United
States in September 2014.[280] A Clue board game in the style of The Legend of
Zelda series was released in June 2017.[281] A UNO-styled The Legend of Zelda
game was released in February 2018, exclusively at GameStop in North America.
[282] A limited edition Zelda 25th anniversary 3DS was released in December
2011, in Australia.[283]
*** Film ***
In 2007, Imagi_Animation_Studios, which had provided the animation for TMNT and
Astro_Boy, created a pitch reel for a computer-animated The Legend of Zelda
film. Nintendo did not accept the studio's offer due to the memory of the
failure of the 1993 live-action film adaptation of Super_Mario_Bros.[284] In
2013, Aonuma said that, if the development of a film began, the company would
want to use the opportunity to embrace audience interaction in some capacity.
[285][286] In June 2023, it was said that Nintendo was close to closing a deal
with Illumination and Universal_Pictures to produce a film adaptation of the
franchise following the success of their film, The_Super_Mario_Bros._Movie,
[287] but Illumination CEO Chris_Meledandri denied these reports later that
month.[288]
By November 2023, Nintendo was developing a live-action Legend of Zelda film
with Sony_Pictures, which will co-finance and distribute the project worldwide.
[289] Wes_Ball has been attached to direct the film, and Shigeru_Miyamoto and
Avi_Arad will be producing alongside Ball and his producing partner Joe
Hartwick Jr. through their Oddball Entertainment company.[290] Although the
casting had not been announced, Patricia_Summersett, who had previously done
voice work for Princess Zelda, said that she would like to reprise her role for
the character.[291][292] Hunter_Schafer has also expressed interest in playing
Zelda.[293]

The title that Nintendo chose for the series has led to a lot of confusion,
even now, with people still confusing Zelda and Link. Basically, through the
long and short of it, the primary focus of every game is on Link, so the title
does seem a little off, but "Legend of Link" doesn't quite have the same ring
to it (not to mention the confusion of "LoL" and "lol" - they somehow preempted
that by 30 years!)
But, Zelda is just as much an important character in the series as Link, and
even Ganon (or Ganondorf), so does the title link itself* to more than just a
character? What is Zelda's Legend?

      If people still confuse Zelda and Link as characters, its probably
      because they don't play video games.

      @KimberlyW in truth, and I am ashamed to admit this, I initially thought
      that Link was Zelda, the first time I played the game (OoT was my first
      installment in the series).

The first The Legend of Zelda game was focused on rescuing Zelda from the
clutches of Gannon, as his name was originally spelt. The decision to name the
game after the princess instead of the player is probably due in large part to
the ability to pick your own name. The argument over many years for Link to
have no voice was that the player is meant to feel like they aren't controlling
another character, but instead are a part of the game.
In the immediate sequel they dropped "The Legend" and opted for Zelda II: The
Adventure of Link. This sequel wasn't as well received, so as they continued
with the series perhaps it was a marketing decision to draw the attention of
fans of the original.
As for what The Legend is, you have to look at the first game in the timeline,
The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. In that game this Zelda is not a princess,
but the first human/mortal reincarnation of the goddess Hylia. This is further
explained at the back of the Hyrule Historia book in a translated manga titled
The Legend is Born, a page of which I have taken a photo of.
[Whenever_the_land_of_Hylia_is_in_danger‚Ä¶_we_shall_be_reborn‚Ä¶]
Long story short: Zelda is the reincarnation of Hylia, the goddess of the world
seen in the games. Link, while important, is a creation of Hylia, not a god
himself.

      I think it's fair to say that at the time of release of the first game,
      the legend simply was the story of the game. Tons of games were called
      "legend of <something>" at the time, and those were always games where
      the story was the legend the title referred to. Zelda was no exception.

There really is an in-universe "Legend of Zelda", mentioned in the instruction
manual_of_Zelda_II as told by Impa:
     "Link, the time has come when I must tell you the legend of Zelda
     handed down in Hyrule. It is said that long ago, when Hyrule was one
     country, a great ruler maintained the peace in Hyrule using the
     Triforce. However, the king too was a child of man and he died. Then,
     the prince of the kingdom should have become king and inherited
     everything, but he could inherit the Triforce only in part. The
     prince searched everywhere for the missing parts, but could not find
     them."
     "Then, a magician close to the king brought him some unexpected news.
     Before he died, the king had said something about the Triforce to
     only the younger sister of the prince, Princess Zelda. The prince
     immediately questioned the princess, but she wouldn't tell him
     anything. After the prince, the magician threatened to put the
     princess into an eternal sleep if she did not talk, but even still,
     she said nothing."
     "In his anger, the magician tried to cast a magic spell on the
     princess. The surprised prince tried to stop him, but the magician
     fought off the prince and went on chanting the spell. Then, when the
     spell was finally cast, Princess Zelda fell on that spot and entered
     a sleep from which she might never awake. At the same time, the
     magician also fell down and breathed his last."
     "In his grief, the prince placed the princess in this room. He hoped
     that someday she would come back to life. So that this tragedy would
     never be forgotten, he ordered that every female child born into the
     royal household shall be given the name Zelda."
And although Zelda II may be one of the lesser-popular entries of the series
today & did sell less than the original, it was actually fairly well-received
in its day, and remained in Nintendo Power's Top 20/30 & Players' Picks lists
for a good five years, regularly placing in the former even up to December_1994
(the last Top 20 to include NES games).

    * Thanks for your answer! It's actually interesting to see the two versions
      of the same story, which are both legitimate answers. My only
      recommendation would be to re-word your last paragraph - "accusing" other
      users of being "wrong" (whether true or not), often isn't very well
      received .

    * Gwellin's_answer didn't say Zelda 2 wasn't well received, just that this
      "sequel wasn't as well received" (as the first game). As I recall, Zelda
      1 ended up outranking Zelda 2 after some time.

      @Ben You're right, and thanks for the advice. Sorry if my last paragraph
      came across as confrontational. I reworded it to be a bit more civil. I
      didn't mean to criticize Gwellin's answer, but I admit I do get irked
      when Zelda II is treated as an outcast of sorts (even by the game's own
      developers!) when, looking back, the game was actually received rather
      well.

    * I appreciate it. I thought of pointing out my wording and intentions, but
      didn't take offence. Zelda II is a good game that suffers from being too
      different from what everyone expected, which tends to mean fewer people
      give it a try. I know some intense fans of Zelda II, and have learnt to
      appreciate the game much more from them.

      At the time of this writing, this insightful answer linked to Zelda 2's
      manual from a third party site, ZeldaCapital.com A more official resource
      would be the one at Zelda_2's_English_Manual_hosted_by_Nintendo_of_Japan
      (hyperlink going to PDF page 7 (identified as page 6 in the PDF
      contents), which is where the answer sensibly starts quoting from, but
      the storyline itself (and great artwork) does start 3 pages earlier...

This was found within the initial game:
[The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Many_years_ago_Prince_Darkness_Gannon_stole_one_of_the
Triforce_with_Power.____Princess_Zelda_had__one_of_the_Triforce_with_Wisdom.
She_divided_it_into_"_8"_units_to_hide_it_from___Gannon__before_she_was
captured.__Go_find_the__8_units_"_Link"_to_save_her.]
To see this, all you had to do was wait at the title screen. (Simply do not
press the Start button on the title screen. The music will get a bit more up-
beat and this will scroll onto the screen for a bit.)
You could say that the title at the top of this screen represented the name of
the game, but I always thought of this text as the simplified, summarized
version of the legend.
The instruction manual for the first game introduced a slightly longer
backstory, noting Link saved a woman named Impa who told Link this information.
     A long, long time ago the World was in an age of Chaos. In the middle
     of this chaos, in a little kingdom in the land of Hyrule, a legend
     was being handed down from generation to generation, the legend of
     the 'Triforce'; golden triangles possessing mystical powers.
     One day, an evil army attacked this peaceful little kingdom and stole
     the Triforce of Power. This army was led by Gannon, the powerful
     Prince of Darkness who sought to plunge the World into fear and
     darkness under his rule. Fearing his wicked rule, Zelda, the princess
     of this kingdom, split up the Triforce of Wisdom into eight fragments
     and hid them throughout the realm to save the last remaining Triforce
     from the clutches of the evil Ganon. At the same time, she commanded
     her most trustworthy nursemaid, Impa, to secretly escape into the
     land and go find a man with enough courage to destroy the evil
     Gannon. Upon hearing this, Ganon grew angry, imprisoned the princess,
     and sent out a party in search of Impa.
     Braving forests and mountains, Impa fled for her life from her
     pursuers. As she reached the very limit of her energy she found
     herself surrounded by Gannon‚Äôs evil henchmen. Cornered! What could
     she do? ‚Ä¶ But wait!
     All was not lost. A young lad appeared. He skillfully drove off
     Ganon‚Äôs henchmen, and saved Impa from a fate worse than death. His
     name was Link. During his travels he had come across Impa and Ganon‚Äôs
     henchmen. Impa told Link the whole story of the princess Zelda and
     the evil Ganon. Burning with a sense of justice, Link resolved to
     save Zelda, but Ganon was a powerful opponent. He held the Triforce
     of Power. And so, in order to fight off Ganon, Link had to bring the
     scattered eight fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom together to
     rebuild the mystical Triangle.
     If he couldn't do this, there would be no chance Link could fight his
     way into Death Mountain where Ganon lived. Can Link really destroy
     Ganon and save the Princess Zelda? Only your skill can answer that
     question. Good luck. Use the Triforce wisely.

That story came from a couple of pages from the manual, where this story
appeared on top of a drawing of the land of Hyrule:

    * I couldn't help but imagine air quotes in the first screenshot: She
      divided it into "8" units to hide it from "Gannon" before she was
      captured. Sure, I'll go find those "8" pieces of the Triforce.

      Link... you must find all "8" pieces of the "triforce", so that "Gannon"
      doesn't take over "Hyrule". I would totally be "grateful" to you...

      The answer includes a picture from some pages in manual. Nintendo of
      Japan has since published the English manual online, so you can see that
      at nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/en/pdf/CLV-P-NAANE.pdf#page=4 (and zoom in
      more than the picture showin in the answer).

[ "Tell Me A Story" is a monthly column in which I examine the storytelling
elements of specific video games.]
A little over ten years ago, when the Gamecube was in its infancy, Nintendo
unveiled to the world a tech demo for a project titled The Legend of Zelda
128.The demo featured a realistically-styled battle between Link and his
eternal nemesis Ganon, rendered artfully in real-time. While the company
offered no official word on the nature of demo 128,media speculation ran
rampant. IGN went so far as to flout_the_demoas¬†"absolutely everything we could
have hoped for in a Gamecube¬†Zelda¬†title."
A year later, the dark demo was replaced by a cel-shaded one with a whimsical
cartoon style, a radically different product from demo 128.When the final
product was released, it wasn't the sober, gritty game intimated by¬†The Legend
of Zelda 128.This was the new cartoon version, complete with cheery overtones
and a stunningly bright color palette.
In hopes of "[extending] Zelda's¬†reach to all ages," in the words of Shigeru
Miyamoto, the company released The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Wakerin December
of 2002.¬†Nearly ten years have passed, and since then Zelda's black sheep has
shaken off its¬†initially-accrued confusion in favor of a seat deep in the heart
of franchise fans.
[Warning: spoilers ahead.]
My most recent playthrough of the game involved a dear friend who grew up on
the series, myself, and my hard-to-impress baby brother who would rather teabag
his friends in Call of Dutythan participate in "some boring single-player story
game." Before we even got around to rescuing Link's sister, there were Hearts
dancing in his eyes.
Personal anecdotes aside,¬†after a little under a decade of existence The Wind
Waker ¬†has proven to be more iconic -- and classic- than originally thought.
The Legend of Zelda Symphony of the Goddess arrangements feature¬†an_entire
suite dedicated to the game's Celtic-rooted music. ¬†Toon Link's sweet little
mug graces Super Smash Bros.What Zeldafan doesn't recognize the chiming sound
of that infamous baton, echoing the rhythms of the wind? Or better yet, the
riff played when_Tetra_winks?
The story is not your typical Zelda¬†fare -- probably because the game's
aesthetic is one of wind and water rather than the elements at large. Players
spend an amount of time bordering on inordinate (but still fun) sailing between
islands, tendrils of cartoon-drawn wind pushing at your sail. Link's trips
across the waters are frequent and mastering long-range weapons for naval
combat is a necessity.
For the first time since A Link to the Past,Link¬†has a family. The presence of
Link's grandmother and little sister, Aryll, raises the stakes. Link has a home
to come back to, a home filled with people. Unlike previous Links who have
abandoned friends and bachelor households for the sake of his quest, this Link
has a base that is both a personal strength and liability. While he has his
family as a reason to fight the good fight, his grandmother and sister also
present a terrible¬†liability¬†for our hero -- jeopardizing their safety is an
emotional weakness for Link, who must ultimately save them. This becomes
crystal clear when Aryll is kidnapped within the first thirty minutes of the
game.
The legend passed down is the story of Ocarina of Time:a boy in green defeats
Ganon, and the world becomes the Great Sea. Ganon's presence creeps back into
the world, and while none on Link's homeland of Outset Island know what became
of the fabled Kingdom of Hyrule, they do know that the boy in green, the Hero
of Time, did not appear to save them once more. In tradition with this legend,
the boys of Outset Island dress in green when they come of age. This method of
introducing Link's classic green tunic with a history and purpose behind it -
- echoed in the knighting ceremony of Skyward Sword¬†-- is a heart-warming sign
that the player is controlling a boy who is¬†just¬†beginning to grow up. This
spins a thread of the old coming-of-age trope through The¬†Wind Waker.Link
changes internally as he leaves his mark on the world around him, developing a
sense of his¬†responsibilities¬†in this fantasy hyperbole of maturation.
Zelda's hold on the game is tenuous at best until her reveal much later on, but
there is still a young lady in the middle of the action. The mysterious,
unattainable woman that has¬†traditionally¬†been¬†Princess¬†Zelda is replaced by
not one but two very real women -- Aryll and Tetra. ¬†Aryll's kidnapping is the
impetus for Link to venture out with Tetra, and Tetra's allure as the
tomboyish, charming pirate captain is hard to ignore. Aryll is the delicate,
helpless princess that Tetra will never be -- Tetra, who even after her
awakening as a¬†descendant¬†of Zelda, retains the same air of brazen strength
about her. These two women -- girls, really -- serve as foils to each other.
Sweet Aryll drives Link to action and keeps him moving forward through the
power of their sibling bond. Tetra challenges Link, goading him further by
asserting her dominance and superiority. Her initial distrust of our blonde-
haired hero gives him the motivation to¬†persevere, to prove his own value.
Whereas past Zeldas give Link their immediate trust and faith, Tetra's must be
earned. Stealing bombs from her own ship and¬†seeking¬†to rescue Aryll himself
spark her interest, and as she closely observes him via the Pirate's Charm she
begins to warm up to the idea that there is more to Link than he outwardly
demonstrates. The evolution of Tetra's trust in Link adds to the coming-of-age
motif and a deeper element to their relationship. This is not a princess in a
dungeon pouring her hope into the hero -- this is a smart, careful woman
pushing Link to earn her favor. Earning Tetra's respect is earning the blessing
of the princess -- and ultimately, her awakening.
Tetra, like Link, is still very young, but has enough of a commanding presence
to captain a band of grown men. Zeldas are normally sweet, demure, and the
picture of the untouchable princess on her pedestal. Tetra breaks this mold,
and in taking Zelda off her pedestal and placing her out in the open she
becomes a character that we can interact with on a deeper level -- there is no
sugar-coating, she is a real and ordinary woman for a majority of the game.
Once her ancestry is revealed, Link continues to fight for and alongside her -
- but the more you know, the more you care, and the player can't help but
become deeply attached to Tetra in a way that is radically different from their
attachment to Princess Zelda. The attachment is to a¬†real girl, and there are
no preconceived notions about how breathtakingly wonderful she is, or how sweet
and how angelic. This Zelda is not a goddess incarnate, she is a woman with
flaws -- pride and a snarky temper, most notably -- that is more easily
relatable.
The Wind Waker¬†cannot be brought up without discussing the boat. The King of
Red Lions is The Wind Waker's answer to Navi and Tatl and to an extent Epona.
Link cannot bring the boat onto dry land, therefore forcing the player to think
through puzzles without their trigger finger on the "hint" button. Removing
Link's faithful companion from most of the puzzles he must solve forces the
player to think a little harder.
The Wind Waker¬†is deeply tied to Ocarina of Time,both in its legendary and
historical tradition and in its presentation. Knowledge of Ocarina,while not
necessary to understand Wind Waker, enriches certain parts of the game. For
example, the castle in Hyrule displays seven stained glass windows, each
bearing an image of a sage from Ocarina.¬†
Both physically and plot-wise, the story is driven by wind. Wind is what guides
the King of Red Lions over the waves, and often is what you need to solve
certain puzzles. There is a heavy Celtic aesthetic to The Wind Waker,and in
Celtic lore "wind" is more closely¬†synonymous¬†with the element of "spirit." The
wind is the spirit of the game, the only primary element capable of overcoming
water -- use of the Wind Waker is the only way to navigate and conquer the
seemingly endless Great Sea.
The Wind Wakeralso carries a hefty amount of literary tradition on its
shoulders. Like Odysseus of The Odyssey, Link must battle his way through
storms from island to island, acquaint himself with strange new races and take
down mythical beasts. Without directly referencing the story, characters such
as the Master of the Winds (the Greek god Aeolis) are taken directly from the
epic. Link's journey to retrieve the Triforce smacks of¬†Jason and the
Argonauts.As he defeats monsters, forges alliances, and awakens sages to his
aid and goblins to his wrath, Link grows to become a legendary hero much like
Jason.
The Celtic influence coupled with its cartoonish art style creates an
atmosphere akin to that of unveiling an ancient story or legend. Like the
legend the people of Outset Island pass among themselves, the player is being
passed the story of this Link, the Hero of the Winds, who could conduct air and
bend it to his will. The vivid color palette and rounded, almost over-
exaggerated shapes and shading presents a moving storybook, a ¬†gorgeous foray
into what a child's imagination must look like. The player is watching a new
story, a new history unfold, and the art style reflects the wide-eyed sense of
wonder we are meant to experience. As always, Link provides enough of a blank
slate on which to project ourselves and make our own decisions in game
progression, but to an extent the production team has wanted us to feel like
the start-struck children Nintendo hoped to reach out to with The Wind Waker.
Nintendo has integrated storytelling elements into the actual functionality of
the game. A significant amount of time is spent sailing¬†between¬†islands,
battling creatures that swim and ride cyclones along the way. This allows the
game to mask its loading times by rendering the data as the player approaches
the island. Use of the Wind Waker changes the direction of the wind. In order
to discover (or unlock) certain islands, Link must search for map pieces
including the eight TriForce charts that he must decode. If the player is
taking too long to figure out a course of action, be it on a random small
island or in the middle of a dungeon,¬†Link's big, expressive cartoon eyes will
often look in the direction you need to go.
But perhaps the most tantalizing element from The Wind Waker¬†is its particular
incarnation of Ganon. Wielding dual swords, this Ganon towers high over Link,
hiding in the Forbidden Fortress and abducting girls in hopes that one of them
may be Zelda. As he tells Link, the wind in his¬†homeland always brought death,
a sharp contrast to the guiding wind of the Great Sea. Ganon coveted this wind,
which is the same peaceful wind that blew over Hyrule. He sought the Triforce
in order to fulfill his wish -- to expose Hyrule to the sun so that he may
conquer it.
Ganon seeks to conquer Hyrule because he desires freedom from destruction -- he
seeks to destroy so that he may find peace.He may be maniacal and extreme in
his ways, but Ganon only wants to tame a wind that nurtures rather than kills,
though he will kill for it.
Before the battle with Puppet Ganon, he tells Link and Tetra: "So many pathetic
creatures, scattered across a handful of islands, drifting on this sea like
fallen leaves on a forgotten pool... What can they possibly hope to achieve?
Don't you see? All of you...¬†Your gods destroyed you!"Like the Great Flood of
the Bible, the land and its people were washed away by the gods' desire to hit
the reset button, to seal an evil entity for which they were running out of
options to combat. Ganon is a realist; he isn't spinning stories, he is telling
it like it is from the viewpoint of someone who has been raised in a life of
hardship. You can't help by sympathize with Ganon, or at least feel a little
sorry for his predicament.
A man from a far-off country (which by the look of his clothes may be Asia)
has¬†traveled¬†the world to attract the attention of a new set of gods, and to
seek a more comforting wind -- or spirit, if you've been keeping up with the
Celtic undertones.¬†His final speech is poignant, powerful, and sad... Actually,
I'll let Ganontell_you_himself.
The man's last words are a cry out to whatever gods are listening, from his
homeland or Hyrule. As he feels his own spirit leave his body, he sighs: "The
wind... it is blowing..."
A colorful cast of characters and an even brighter design make The Legend of
Zelda: The Wind Waker¬†a real treat for gamers, for both hardcore and casual
Zelda¬†fans. A break in the traditional mold Nintendo has set for the series,
The Wind Waker¬†is a refreshing breath of air, a treat of a game with hidden
depth beneath its main quest. The game builds on what Ocarina of Time¬†and
Majora's Mask¬†have already established, but with the added twist of unique
artistic style and a foundation built on an ancient culture deeply invested in
its legends and spirituality. The game presents a story that is both fun and
heart-warming, light and dark, proving that legends and fantastic tales are not
just for children but those of all ages.

****** Lambertville High and the Legend of ‚ÄúBuckeye‚Äù ******
   Mark_and_Mark    August_7,_2012

The town of Lambertville was a great place to grow up, especially in the 80‚Äôs.
All my friends and I ran around in leather and plaid, harassing tourists who
came to town to go antique shopping, and with mohawks held high in the air, we
would proudly march across the bridge to New Hope and terrorize anything and
everything that moved. Since then, I have lived in a number of places and seen
many strange things (currently, I reside in a correctional facility), but of
all of the places I have been and all the things that I have seen, my childhood
times in L-ville were by far the weirdest. Here‚Äôs a story that I‚Äôd like to
share with the rest of my fellow New Jerseyans:
High atop a hill we affectionately call ‚ÄúMusic Mountain,‚Äù sits the ruins of the
old Lambertville High School. This is where all the kids from L-ville and the
surrounding areas went to school before South Hunterdon was constructed. I
think it closed down around 1955, and burned down about 1984. What‚Äôs left of
the school still stands today and is even more creepy since the fire. On a
chalkboard on the 2nd floor is an intricate drawing of children sitting in rows
of desks studying while flames rise up on all sides of them. The floor is a bit
unstable. Behind the school, about 50 feet through some tall weeds and brush,
sits the old football field, still marked clearly by the rusty old goal posts.
This is where the weirdness begins‚Ä¶the story of Buckeye.
It was a cold day in the middle of November, 1935. Lambertville High was doing
the usual on this day, getting ready for the big game. You could hear the
marching band practice as you walked in the front door. Banners hung in the
hallways, there was a pep rally in the gymnasium, and the thought of L-ville
kicking the crap out of its arch-rival New Hope, was on the mind of every kid
at school that day. This was one of the biggest days of the year atL.H.S., for
whoever won the annual Turkey Bowl would have bragging rights for the rest of
the year.¬† 4:00 p.m. rolled around and everyone watched as the New Hope buses
rolled up the hill and pulled around back to let out the players onto the
field. By 4:30, the game had started.
Both teams went scoreless the first quarter, but by the time the half rolled
around, the score was 21-21. You could almost smell the tension in the air. The
Eagles (L-ville) and the Buckeyes (New Hope) both did their absolute best with
the half-time show, hoping to get the crowd up and the players into the game.
The third quarter now began. New Hope had the ball and was running for the
touchdown when the wide receiver from New Hope was tackled. To everyone‚Äôs
surprise, he didn‚Äôt get up. The coaches rushed the field but by the time they
got there, the boy was dead, his neck broken, and his head almost turned
completely around. The game was forfeited.
The parents of the boy who was killed petitioned that football was too
dangerous and that New Hope should give it up. (This accounts for the reason
why New Hope still doesn‚Äôt have a football team to this day.) The years went
on, and the memory of the poor Buckeye that lost his young life that day faded
from everyone‚Äôs memory.
1955‚ÄîL.H.S. packed its bags and headed up to the new school, South Hunterdon.
The old high school became the local hang-out for the greaser gangs of the day
and many of the fights between L-ville and Flemington or New Hope took place up
there. One night, a group of 4 or 5 guys was hanging out on the back steps when
one of the guys told the story about the Buckeye who had died there. He had
heard it from his uncle who had gone to school there at the time it had
happened.
The guys were feeling a little rowdy and were a bit drunk. They started
clowning around and joking about the death and one of them stood up and
proclaimed, ‚ÄúI challenge Buckeye to a race across the football field!‚Äù Everyone
laughed and continued on with their drinking. Pretty soon, a cold wind started
to blow and everyone became silent.
From the far end of where the football field once was, a pair of evil red eyes
appeared in the darkness and a voice whispered through the wind and told the
boys, ‚ÄúRun across the football field from end to end or die!‚Äù One of the boys
turned and started to run when he fell to the concrete, cold and blue. The
remaining boys heard the voice again, so they all lined up on one side of the
field and began to run to the other side. They ran with all that they had and
when they finally reached the other side, another one of the boys was missing.
They all ran home and locked the doors behind them, not saying a word about
what had just happened.
The next day, when the parents of the two missing boys called the police, the
bodies were discovered up at the old high school, their heads almost turned
completely around. The incident was blamed on a fight. Signs were posted and a
chain-link fence was installed on the driveway of the old school.
I have been to the old high school more times than I can count and can
definitely vouch that there is a strange presence there. Every time I walk up
the old concrete steps, a chill goes down my spine. A few times during my
childhood, I got up the nerve to challenge Buckeye but always, halfway through
the word ‚ÄúBuckeye,‚Äù I would get a crazy feeling and shut my mouth and head
right home. Some people claim it‚Äôs just a myth, some say it‚Äôs real, but I can
say for sure, it is something. So if you decide to visit the old school, take
my advice: don‚Äôt go there alone, and definitely don‚Äôt go there at night!

Challenging Billy, NOT Buckeye, to an Unfriendly Game of Ball
‚ÄúBuckeye‚Äù isn‚Äôt the name of the dead football player that most of the local
kids of Lambertville remember, it is ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù that the ghost is called (I myself
am a resident of Lambertville and spent many a scary night drinking and
partying in the old place, believe me it is not something to fool around with!
The local legend connected with ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù is that if you go to the old stairwell
by the front door leading into the place and than stand facing the front window
while standing between the first and second floor stairway, and utter the words
‚ÄúI challenge Billy to a game of football‚Äù. A football will be thrown from the
top of the staircase by Billy, breaking your neck in two! Just like what
happened to Billy almost 75 years ago!
Another story about the kids who challenge Billy to a game of football is that
they will be enveloped by a strange mist and then will disappear. A guy I know
named Lem actually did try to summon Billy on the football field once after a
kid they just met brought them up there to try it. The mist arose along with a
strong gust of wind and he swears that he saw something come charging across
the field to get them. They all ran and nobody ever saw the mysterious kid
again! I asked my grandmother, who actually went to the school and lives in the
middle of town near Mason‚Äôs Bar. She assured me that the legend of the boy
being killed during the middle of the game was true, but his name was Jimmy
Cavallo, not Billy or Buckeye. ‚ÄìRichard Scurti

Pok√©mon[a][b] is a Japanese media_franchise consisting of video_games, animated
series and films, a_trading_card_game, and other related media. The franchise
takes place in a shared_universe in which humans co-exist with creatures known
as Pok√©mon, a large variety of species endowed with special powers. The
franchise's primary target_audience is children aged 5 to 12,[2] but it is
known to attract people of all ages.[I]
The franchise originated as a_pair_of_role-playing_games developed by Game
Freak, from an original concept by its founder, Satoshi_Tajiri. Released on the
Game_Boy on February 27, 1996, the games became sleeper_hits and were followed
by manga series, a trading card game, and anime series and films. From 1998 to
2000, Pok√©mon was exported to the rest of the world, creating an unprecedented
global phenomenon dubbed "Pok√©mania". By 2002, the craze had ended, after which
Pok√©mon became a fixture in popular_culture, with new products being released
to this day. In the summer of 2016, the franchise spawned a second craze with
the release of Pok√©mon_Go, an augmented_reality_game developed by Niantic.
Pok√©mon has since been estimated to be the world's highest-grossing_media
franchise and one of the best-selling_video_game_franchises.
Pok√©mon has an uncommon ownership structure.[11] Unlike most IPs, which are
owned by one company, Pok√©mon is jointly owned by three: Nintendo, Game Freak,
and Creatures.[1] Game Freak develops the core series role-playing_games, which
are published by Nintendo exclusively for their consoles, while Creatures
manages the trading card game and related merchandise, occasionally developing
spin-off titles. The three companies established The_Pok√©mon_Company (TPC) in
1998 to manage the Pok√©mon property within Asia. The Pok√©mon anime series and
films are co-owned by Shogakukan. Since 2009, The Pok√©mon Company International
(TPCi), a subsidiary of TPC, has managed the franchise in all regions outside
of Asia.[12][13]
***** Name *****
The original full name of the franchise is Pocket Monsters („Éù„Ç±„ÉÉ„Éà„É¢„É≥„Çπ„Çø„Éº, Poketto
MonsutƒÅ), which has been commonly_abbreviated to Pokemon („Éù„Ç±„É¢„É≥) since its
launch. When the franchise was released internationally, the short form of the
title was used, with an acute_accent (¬¥) over the e to aid in pronunciation.
[14]
Pok√©mon refers to both the franchise itself and the creatures within its
fictional universe. As a noun, it is identical_in_both_the_singular_and_plural,
as is every individual species name;[15] it is grammatically correct to say
"one Pok√©mon" and "many Pok√©mon", as well as "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu".
[16]
***** General concept *****
Main article: Gameplay_of_Pok√©mon
The Pok√©mon franchise is set in a world in which humans coexist with creatures
known as Pok√©mon. Pok√©mon Red and Blue contain 151 Pok√©mon species, with new
ones being added in subsequent games; as of January 2024, 1,025_Pok√©mon_species
have been introduced.[c] Most Pok√©mon are inspired by real-world animals or
mythical creatures based on real-life folklore.[17] For example, Pikachu are a
yellow mouse-like species[18] with lightning bolt-shaped tails[19] that possess
electrical abilities.[20]
The player_character takes the role of a Pok√©mon Trainer. The Trainer has three
primary goals: travel and explore the Pok√©mon world; discover and catch each
Pok√©mon species in order to complete their Pok√©dex; and train a team of up to
six Pok√©mon at a time and have them engage in Pok√©mon battles. Most Pok√©mon can
be caught with spherical devices known as Pok√©_Balls. Once the opposing Pok√©mon
is sufficiently weakened, the Trainer throws the Pok√© Ball against the Pok√©mon,
which is then transformed into a form of energy and transported into the
device. Once the catch is successful, the Pok√©mon is tamed and is under the
Trainer's command from then on. If the Pok√© Ball is thrown again, the Pok√©mon
re-materializes into its original state. The Trainer's Pok√©mon can engage in
battles against opposing Pok√©mon, including those in the wild or owned by other
Trainers. Because the franchise is aimed at children, these battles are never
presented as overtly violent and contain no blood or gore.[II] Pok√©mon never
die in battle ‚Äì they faint upon being defeated, and can then be rejuvenated at
a Pok√©mon Center.[III]
When a Pok√©mon wins a battle, it gains experience_points.[29] After gaining a
certain amount of them, the Pok√©mon levels up, and its statistics rise. As its
level increases, the Pok√©mon learns new offensive and defensive moves to use in
battle.[30][31] Furthermore, many species can undergo a form of spontaneous
metamorphosis called Pok√©mon_evolution, and transform into stronger forms.[32]
Most Pok√©mon will evolve at a certain level, while others evolve through
different means, such as exposure to a certain item or trading with another
trainer.[33]
***** History *****
**** Origins ****
The main idea behind Pok√©mon was conceived by Satoshi_Tajiri. Tajiri was born
on August 28, 1965,[34] and grew up in Machida, a suburb of Tokyo.[35] As a
child, he enjoyed discovering and catching insects and other small creatures in
the various ponds and fields that surrounded his town.[36][37] During Japan's
economic_miracle, many cities, including Machida, were significantly expanded.
As_a_consequence, Machida's nature was largely destroyed. In his second year of
junior_high_school,[38][39] an arcade_hall opened in Tajiri's neighborhood,
introducing him to video_games. While studying electrical engineering at Tokyo
College_of_Technology¬†[ja], Tajiri began publishing a doujinshi magazine titled
Game Freak. The title was inspired by the 1932 film Freaks, which Tajiri was
fascinated with at the time.[40] He self-published the first issue of the
magazine in March 1983, at the age of 17.[41][42] At the time, magazines
specializing in video games did not yet exist in Japan, allowing Game Freak to
fill a gap_in_the_market.[43][44] Sometime later, Tajiri was contacted by
aspiring manga artist Ken_Sugimori, who became Game Freak's illustrator.[45]
Game Freak folded in the late 1980s,[41] by which point Tajiri had become a
respected game_journalist in Japan's fledgling video game industry.[46]
Tajiri's knowledge of video games brought him into contact with Tsunekazu
Ishihara. Ishihara had studied Arts and Science at Tsukuba_University, and was
trained in CGI. After working in advertising for two years, Ishihara joined a
company named Sedic in 1983, which created video graphics and software,[47]
including one video game, Otocky (1987).[48][49] As video games grew in
popularity, Sedic also produced a number of game-related television shows for
Fuji_Television's late-night slot.[47] In his job as a TV producer, Ishihara
befriended Tajiri, as well as Shigesato_Itoi, who would later become CEO of
Ape, Inc.[50][51] Ishihara was also the general director of the world's first
gaming encyclopedia: TV Games: Encyclopedia of Video Games („ÉÜ„É¨„Éì„Ç≤„Éº„É†‚ÄïÈõªË¶ñÈÅäÊàØÂ§ßÂÖ®,
Terebigƒìmu ‚Äï Denshi Y≈´gi Taizen).[52][53] Kenji Hatakeyama & Masakazu Kubo
(2000) wrote that, at the time, Ishihara was probably the most well-connected
man in the industry,[54] with a knowledge of games "beyond comparison".[55]
Ishihara was also interested in playing_cards,[56][57] and contributed to the
development of at least three simple card_games designed by Itoi and published
by Ape.[d]
In 1986, Tajiri, Sugimori, and a few other enthusiasts started an informal
development team called Game Freak, named after the magazine it grew out of.
Over the next few years, they independently_developed the puzzle game Quinty,
working on it alongside school or their regular jobs.[64] However, no one
within the group knew how to make the game's_music. After consulting all his
contacts, Tajiri got in touch with Junichi_Masuda, who became the group's
composer.[65] Quinty was finished in 1989, and published by Namco.[66] Tajiri
officially incorporated Game_Freak_Co.,_Ltd. on April 26, 1989.[67]

Duo_gameboy.JPG]Two original Game_Boys connected with a Game_Link_Cable
Tajiri started to think of what was to become Pok√©mon while completing Quinty,
and before he officially founded Game Freak. Around this time, Nintendo
announced the upcoming release of the Game_Boy, a handheld console that would
revolutionize the gaming industry. Tajiri learned that the device would have a
link_port, and with the corresponding Game_Link_Cable, two Game Boys could be
linked together.[68] Sometime later, Tajiri remembered an incident while
playing Dragon_Quest_II (1987), a role-playing_game (RPG) for the Famicom
(NES). The game features randomly appearing items of varying rarity, including
an extremely rare item called Mysterious Hat.[e] Tajiri did not encounter any,
while Ken Sugimori, who was also playing the game, encountered two. Upon
recalling this experience, Tajiri realized that the cable now made it possible
to transfer things from one cartridge to another.[IV] He noted that, until
then, the Game Link Cable was only used for competing, but not for something
else.[73] Combining this inspiration with his memories of catching insects and
other small species, Tajiri's idea would eventually evolve into a virtual
recreation of his boyhood experiences,[74] and an attempt to "regain the world
that he had lost".[75] He would later state that the game represents "the story
of a boy's summer day".[76]
[//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Gachapon.jpg/220px-
Gachapon.jpg]Gashapon capsules have been cited as an inspiration for Pokemon.
Tajiri and his Game Freak staff began pondering over a game centered on
capturing creatures of differing rarity. Since the Game Boy is a portable
device, these creatures could then be exchanged with other players in real life
using the link cable. Once the player has caught a creature in-game, it was to
be stored in miniaturized form in a special capsule. This facet of the game was
inspired by Ultraseven, a tokusatsu show that Tajiri had enjoyed as a child.
[18] The_series'_titular_character owns a number of capsules containing
miniaturized kaiju (monsters), which come out and return to their original
sizes when the capsule is thrown into mid-air. Kaiju media in general were an
important influence on Pokemon, as many Game Freak staff members had grown up
with them.[70][77] Other influences that have been cited by Tajiri include:
gashapon, capsules with toy figures in them that can be drawn from vending
machines;[78][79] collectible_cards, such as baseball_cards, Ultraman cards and
menko;[V] The_Final_Fantasy_Legend (1989), the first RPG for the Game Boy;[84]
and petting_in_Japan, with Tajiri noting that having Pokemon is similar to
having pets.[85] Tajiri initially named his project Capsule Monsters, which
GF's staff commonly_shortened to Capumon.[86] However, it later turned out that
the term Capsule Monsters could not be trademarked, and it was subsequently
decided to call the game Pocket Monsters, which became Pokemon. According to
Tomisawa (2000), the phrase "Capsule Monsters" was already registered.[86]
According to Hatakeyama & Kubo (2000), the word "capsule" could not be used in
the trademark.[87] Tomisawa (2000) states that the Game Freak staff then came
up with several alternatives, before someone within the team suggested "Pocket
Monsters".[86]
In March 1989, Nintendo co-founded Ape, Inc. with Itoi. Ape's principal work
was Mother (1989), a role-playing game written by Itoi, but it was also founded
with the intent to give outside talent a chance to pitch new, innovative games.
[51][56] At the time, Ape was housed in the same Kanda-Sudach≈ç office building
as Nintendo, located in Tokyo.[88] Ishihara, a friend of both Itoi and Tajiri,
was involved with Ape's management (and would become its vice-president in
1991).[51][54] Tajiri's relationship with Ishihara prompted Tajiri to present
his idea for Pocket Monsters at Ape's office.[89][90] Present during Tajiri's
pitch was Takashi Kawaguchi, who worked at Nintendo's General Affairs
Department and was also a manager at Ape.[56][91] Kawaguchi brought the idea to
Nintendo president Hiroshi_Yamauchi, who reportedly said: "This is it. This is
the idea I've been waiting for."[92] By pure coincidence, Ishihara had come up
with an idea for a game similar to that of Tajiri, and around the same time was
discussing it with Ape. This game, Toto, involved "using the Game Boy as an
insect cage". Ishihara emphasized, however, that the idea of trading creatures
with the link cable was Tajiri's. GF and Ape agreed to merge their projects
together.[93] According to Tajiri, the two teams initially collaborated on the
game, but the work proved difficult, one of the reasons being that Ape was busy
developing EarthBound.[94][95] Tajiri eventually figured that "rather than
working with Ape, we had to do something on our own, or the project would never
get finished".[94] Ape, Inc. is not credited on the final product.
The development contract was signed at the beginning of 1990, with a planned
delivery of the game in October.[96] Tajiri directed the project, working under
Ishihara.[97] Ishihara was the producer ‚Äì he managed the budget, staff, and
work schedule, monitored the game's overall progress, and served as a liaison
between Game Freak and Nintendo.[93][98] Ishihara also contributed ideas to the
development,[57] and helped with debugging.[99][100] Sugimori was in charge of
the graphics and character design.[101] Masuda created all music and sound
effects, and did part of the programming.[102] The budget that Nintendo granted
to Game Freak was low;[96] thus, Pocket Monsters was initially planned as a
small, compact game, based primarily around Tajiri's core idea of exchanging.
[84][103] However, as development progressed, GF's ideas and ambitions for
Pokemon grew.[84] They soon realized that the game they were beginning to
envision would not be easy to make. Sugimori admitted that, at the time, no one
at GF had much knowledge of RPGs. "We thought we could handle it, but as we
began working, we realized it was going to be tough", he acknowledged.[104]
Pocket Monsters was suspended indefinitely, and GF turned their focus on other
titles (see Game_Freak_¬ß¬†Games).
After the game's initial development phase in 1990 and 1991,[105] the staff
"tinkered with it from time to time", as Sugimori put it.[106] For instance, by
October 1992, a large number of Pokemon had been designed, and a poll was held
that month among all staff members to gauge the popularity of the different
species. Several more such votes followed to determine collectively which
Pokemon should be included.[107] Still, development had mostly come to a halt
until the summer of 1994, after the release of the platform game Pulseman, upon
which Tajiri decided it was time to make a serious effort towards finishing
Pocket Monsters.[108] By this point, Game Freak's experience had grown
considerably. Over the years, a number of new staff members had been added to
the company. One of them was Atsuko_Nishida, a graphic artist who created
Pikachu, among others.[109][110][111] Ishihara used his knowledge of card games
to add more depth to the battle system, and among other things suggested
Pokemon_types. Ishihara also came up with the idea of the Pokedex, a portable
encyclopedic device which players can use to keep track of the Pokemon they
caught.[57] Throughout the years, Tajiri had several conversations with Shigeru
Miyamoto,[112] Nintendo's top game designer who Tajiri described as a mentor
figure.[18] Although, in a 2018 retrospect, Miyamoto downplayed his role in
advising Tajiri, and stated that his contributions to Pokemon were in fact
limited.[113] Miyamoto did, however, suggest the use of different colored
cartridges for the game, in response to Tajiri's and Ishihara's musings about
making each playthrough slightly different, as to 'individualize' the player's
experience.[114] According to Tajiri, "five or seven colors" were considered,
[115] but they eventually settled on two: Red and Green. Otherwise identical,
each had Pokemon not found in the other, encouraging players to socialize and
trade to complete their collection.[114]
Ishihara aspired to create video games of his own.[116] As Pocket Monsters Red
and Green were nearing completion, Ishihara founded Creatures,_Inc. on November
8, 1995. Upon founding, the company was housed in the same office building as
Nintendo in Tokyo.[117] Co-ownership of the Pokemon property, which Ishihara
helped create, was subsequently assigned to Creatures. This resulted in Pokemon
having three legal owners: Game Freak, the main developer; Creatures,
representing producer Ishihara; and Nintendo, the publisher. Anne_Allison
(2006) wrote that Nintendo also bought the property after Red and Green were
finished.[118] Hatakeyama & Kubo (2000) noted that the ownership structure of
Pokemon is uncommon.[11] They wrote that "Pokemon is probably the only property
in the world today for which the original rights are not concentrated in a
single company", like The_Walt_Disney_Company does with their IPs.[119] Tajiri
and Ishihara did consider merging Game Freak and Creatures at one point.
However, Tajiri decided against it because he feared it would erase what he had
built up since he was a teenager. "I felt threatened by the idea of changing
how Game Freak was operating, and starting back over with Mr. Ishihara", he
said. "It was an identity problem. If Game Freak ceased to exist, then so would
I". Tajiri noted that, since Game Freak and Creatures both focus on Pokemon, it
sometimes felt more like different departments than different companies.[89]
Pocket Monsters Red and Green were finally finished in December 1995.[120] A
release date of December 21 that year was announced,[121] but missed. After
sufficient cartridges, manuals and packages had been manufactured, the pair of
games ended up being published on February 27, 1996. However, the property was
copyrighted in 1995, and "¬© 1995" is shown on the title screens[122] and
cartridges.[123] This year is since used on the copyright_notice[1] seen on
many Pokemon products, even though no actual Pokemon product was released in
1995.[124]
**** 1996‚Äì1998: Rise in Japan ****
*** Release of Red & Green ***
Nintendo had no high expectations of Pocket Monsters Red and Green, and media
largely ignored the game(s).[125] By_1996, the seven-year-old Game_Boy console
was considered yesterday's news and near the end_of_its_lifecycle.[25][126]
[127] On the other hand, new Game Boys continued to be manufactured and sold.
[128] The console was widespread and, due to its age, affordable to children.
[25][129] Also, the Game Boy had experienced a small revival in Japan in 1995
due to the success of Mario's_Picross. Coincidentally, this game was directed
by Ishihara, and co-developed by Ape. The popularity of Mario's Picross incited
Nintendo to develop the Game_Boy_Pocket,[130] a slimmer and improved version of
the Game Boy, released in Japan on July 21, 1996.[131] Because of the timing
and naming, some were under the impression that the Game Boy Pocket was made to
promote Pocket Monsters, but this was in fact a coincidence that would end up
benefiting both.[132]
*** CoroCoro manga, Mew lottery ***
Two media channels that would play important roles in the Pokemon franchise
were the CoroCoro_Comic, released monthly, and its sister magazine Bessatsu
CoroCoro Comic, released bi-monthly. Both manga magazines are published by
Shogakukan, a long-time business partner of Nintendo, and have featured manga
based on Nintendo properties (e.g. Super_Mario-kun, Kirby_of_the_Stars, Donkey
Kong). At the time of Pokemon's release, the main CoroCoro magazine was read by
one in four elementary school students.[133] CoroCoro's deputy editor-in-chief
was Masakazu_Kubo¬†[ja]. On Ishihara's suggestion,[134] Kubo commissioned the
creation of a_manga_adaptation. Written and illustrated by Kosaku_Anakubo¬†[ja],
its first chapter was featured in the March/April issue of Bessatsu CoroCoro
Comic, released on February 28, 1996, the day after Red and Green's release.
[135] Shogakukan, which frequently surveys their target groups, determined that
the Pocket Monsters manga was well received.[136]
To further promote Red and Green, the May issue of CoroCoro, released on April
15, 1996, announced the "Legendary Pokemon Offer", centered around a
mysterious, secret Pokemon called Mew.[137][138] Mew was a last-minute addition
to Red & Green. It is unobtainable in the game(s) through usual means, and was
intended to be used at a later point in some post-launch activity.[139] To
participate in the promotion, CoroCoro readers had to send in a postcard, and
from the entrants, 20 were selected at random. The winners then had to send in
their cartridge so that Mew could be uploaded onto it. The lottery was a
success and increased word-of-mouth.[25][139] By September, sales of Red and
Green had surpassed 1 million units.[140]
*** Blue Version ***
After the release of Pokemon Red and Green, Game Freak continued to grow, and a
number of new employees were hired. For training purposes, they were ordered to
study and make bug fixes to the source_code of Red & Green, and to create new
sprites for it;[141] the test was later dubbed Pocket_Monsters_Blue. It was
originally not meant to be sold. Only a small number of handmade copies were
made, intended as a special gift to "20 to 100 people".[142] After Kubo learned
of it, he encouraged Tajiri and Ishihara to allow an official release of Blue.
President Hiroshi_Yamauchi initially rejected this, fearing it would confuse
people into believing it was an entirely new Pokemon game. Kawaguchi then
suggested an alternative, which Yamauchi agreed with: Blue would not receive a
normal retail release, but would instead be made available only through mail
order for a limited time as a special offer.[143] It was announced in the
November issue of CoroCoro, which explicitly stated that Blue was not a new
game, but rather a special, limited edition to celebrate 1 million sales of Red
and Green.[138] The offer was a surprisingly big success: 300,000 units were
expected to be sold, but over double was ordered.[144][145]
*** Trading Card Game ***
The Pokemon_Trading_Card_Game was one of the first collectible_card_games
(CCGs) developed in Japan. Its creation was influenced by Magic:_The_Gathering,
the first CCG in history.[146][147][148] Indeed, the Pokemon Trading Card Game
can be considered a simplified version of Magic.[149][150] First released in
the United States in 1993, Magic had gained popularity not just in North
America and Europe, but also in Asia.[151] Ishihara was fond of playing_cards,
[57] and had contributed to the development of at least three simple card games
designed by Shigesato_Itoi and released through Ape, Inc.[d] At the time,
Ishihara was particularly interested in Magic: The Gathering.[146] While
developing the Pokemon RPG, he realized that the concept behind it could be
adapted into a Magic-like CCG.[56] The Pokemon Trading Card Game was designed
by Ishihara,[152] Akihiko Miura, K≈çichi ≈åyama, and Takumi Akabane.[153] All
were former staff members of Ape and had previously worked on EarthBound
(1994): Miura was the game's main designer, ≈åyama was its art director, and
Akabane was one of its chief debuggers.[154]
While card games have_a_long_history_in_Japan, a collectible card game was a
relatively new concept there, and at the time not widely known.[155] Because of
this, Ishihara had difficulties finding distributors. Sometime in 1995,
Ishihara pitched the card game to Nintendo. They agreed to have the cards
manufactured, subcontracting an unidentified printing company. However,
Nintendo did not want the hassle of having to develop a distribution system
from the ground up, i.e. finding retailers willing to sell a CCG.[156] Ishihara
was then contacted by Satoshi Kayama, director of a small firm called Media
Factory. Like Ishihara, Kayama was a fan of card games. He felt that CCGs would
soon rise to prominence in Japan, and had been gathering information on the
possibility of developing such a game in some form. When Kayama heard that
Creatures had developed a CCG, he contacted Ishihara and offered to distribute
it, signing the contract near the end of 1995.[157]
CoroCoro again proved a valuable information channel. The Trading Card Game was
first announced in the November issue, the same one that announced Pokemon
Blue.[158] The issue came bundled with two promo cards: one of Purin
(Jigglypuff) and one of Pikachu. Surveys showed that they were respectively the
most and second-most popular Pokemon at the time.[159] On October 20, 1996, the
first card set was released.[160] Booster_packs were launched the same day,
containing 10 randomly inserted cards.[161] In the West, the booster packs
contained 11 cards.[f] The original set would be titled the Base_Set in
English. Many more sets would follow. Despite being ignored by the media,
except for the CoroCoro,[162] the cards became an instant success upon release.
87 million Pokemon cards were shipped by the end of March 1997, six months
after its launch, and one month before the debut of the next big installment of
the franchise: the Pokemon anime. The success of the TV series would cause the
cards' sales figure to explode: by March 1998, a total of 499 million cards had
been produced in Japan.[163]
*** Anime production launches ***
By August 1996, Kubo had become convinced of Pokemon's potential, and believed
Shogakukan should create an_anime_adaptation.[164] Nintendo was hesitant,
noting that if the anime would flop, it would negatively affect the popularity
of the game.[165] Ishihara initially opposed the idea, because he thought it
would overly hasten the 'consumption' of the property: he feared that if the
series would end, people would assume that Pokemon has ended, and move on to
the next thing.[166] At the time, Creatures and Game Freak were planning the
sequel(s) to Red and Green, Pokemon_Gold_and_Silver, and Ishihara did not want
the anime to end before they could release their new games.[167][168] Kubo was
ultimately able to resolve the concerns of all parties involved. An important
aspect of Kubo's bargaining power was the then-ongoing Mini_4WD craze and its
accompanying hit series Bakus≈ç_Ky≈çdai_Let's_&_Go!!. Kubo had an important role
in the creation of both, which impressed the stakeholders.[169] To appease
Ishihara, Kubo promised him that the anime would last for at least a year and a
half. This was unusually long for a debuting anime, and required a big
investment.[167][170] Kubo's proposal for Pocket Monsters was officially
approved on September 26, 1996.[171] For Nintendo of Japan, it was the first
time they licensed a TV series.[172] Kubo assigned independent producer Choji
Yoshikawa¬†[ja] to lead the project.[173]
Shogakukan_Productions, commonly called ShoPro, was Shogakukan's production
company. The animation company they commissioned was OLM,_Inc. (Oriental Light
and Magic), on Kubo's suggestion.[174] Kunihiko_Yuyama, one of OLM's founding
members, became the anime's director. ShoPro assembled a team of five writers,
plus two supporting writers.[175] All key people involved with the production
of Pokemon were well-experienced and had proven track records within Japan's
anime industry. Yoshikawa felt that the team got lucky. "The probability of so
many great people coming together at the same time is very low", he said.[176]
Per Tajiri's explicit condition,[177] every anime team member had to play the
game extensively, including the illustrators and voice actors.[176] The anime
staff "unanimously agreed that the game was interesting"[178] and "felt
connected with each other through the world of Pokemon",[176] feeling
positively challenged to make an anime that would match the game's quality.

Liam_meets_pikachu_%2814438634188%29.jpg]A boy hugging a Pikachu-costumed
performer. Pikachu became a popular character among both boys and girls.[180]
A production council was formed to produce the anime. Different people appeared
at different meetings, but four individuals usually present were Ishihara of
Creatures, Sugimori of Game Freak, Yuyama of OLM, and independent producer
Yoshikawa. Yoshikawa had the final say. The council decided on the anime's
worldview, characters, general storyline, and various important details. The
early meetings, which were also attended by Tajiri, usually started with a Q&A
session in which Tajiri and Ishihara were asked about the Pokemon universe.
[181] The council was careful to have the anime be in concordance with the
video game. Inevitably, there had to be differences between the two, but all
agreed that the overall worldview as envisioned by Tajiri should not be
disturbed.[182] At the start of the video game, the player has to choose one of
three starter Pokemon: Fushigidane, Hitokage, or Zenigame (Bulbasaur,
Charmander, or Squirtle). The council didn't want to unfairly popularize any of
them, and wanted the protagonist to start out with a different Pokemon.[183]
[184] Hatakeyama & Kubo (2000) wrote that, by coincidence, three people
independently suggested to the council that a Pikachu should be a main
character in the anime: Kubo, Yuyama, and Keisuke Iwata of TV Tokyo's Film
Department.[185] In the end, all council members agreed that Pikachu should be
one of Pocket Monsters' central icons, as they expected Pikachu to appeal to
both boys and girls, as well as their mothers. This would expand its audience,
which was considered a core objective of the anime.[186][187]
During the council's first meeting, Yoshikawa brought up the issue on whether
the Pokemon in the anime could talk, and if not, how they could communicate. In
the video games, each has a specific cry. In Anakubo's_CoroCoro_manga, most
could speak. At first, the council believed there should be a mixture of
Pokemon that could talk and some that could not. However, this idea was
eventually discarded: the Pokemon had to make a specific cry. The council
agreed that Pokemon were like animals, and while they and humans should be able
to understand each other in the series, they should not speak each other's
language.[188] It was decided that Pikachu would repeatedly say its own name in
various intonations. The role of Pikachu was given to Ikue_Otani. During try-
outs, Yuyama had Otani voice Pikachu in normal Japanese, as well as in 'Pikachu
talk', in which it only said the syllables of its name. Yuyama realized that,
even in the latter style of limited communication, Otani was experienced enough
to still convey the messages and emotions needed.[189]
ShoPro paid half of the production cost of Pokemon. TV_Tokyo paid the other
half and was granted co-ownership of the anime.[190] The ads during the show's
commercial breaks were managed by advertisement agency JR_Kikaku¬†[ja], which
was in turn paid by sponsors buying advertisement space.[191] In negotiating
with TV Tokyo, Kubo managed to secure the 19:00 ‚Äì 19:30 timeslot on Tuesdays.
[192] Pocket Monsters premiered on April 1, 1997. By November, it had become
the highest-rated program on TV Tokyo.[193] The anime succeeded in its goal of
widening Pokemon's audience. Although the video games and the cards remained
mostly of interest to boys, the anime also got more girls interested in the
franchise, and girls' purchases of Pokemon products increased.[180] This has
been partly credited to Pikachu, who gained widespread popularity among both
boys and girls.[194] The success of this character would later lead to the game
Pocket Monsters Pikachu (Pok√©mon_Yellow:_Special_Pikachu_Edition), released in
Japan on September 12, 1998.[195][196] An adaptation of Pokemon Blue, this
version was made to resemble the TV series more.[197]
*** Copyright council formed, merchandising expands ***
In the early months of the franchise, Nintendo was the contractual
representative for Pokemon, and thus the central contact point for all Pokemon-
related licensing (the approval of branded products).[198] Around the time that
planning of the anime begun, licensing requests for Pokemon started to
increase, which Nintendo had difficulties handling due to a lack of
(experienced) staff.[199] Nintendo consequently granted ShoPro exclusive
licensor rights. This was the first time that Nintendo of Japan (NoJ) granted
licensor rights to another company, aside from its overseas subsidiaries
Nintendo of America (NoA) and Nintendo of Europe (NoE).[200]
A copyright council was formed, headed by Ishihara. Beginning in April 1997,
the council met every Tuesday, in the conference room of Creatures' office, at
the Nintendo Kanda Building in Sudach≈ç, Tokyo.[117][201][202] Attendees usually
included Ishihara and his secretary, representatives of Nintendo, Game Freak,
ShoPro, TV Tokyo, and JR Kikaku, as well as head of the anime Yoshikawa.[203]
Broadly put, every meeting had three types of agenda items: discussing Pokemon-
related events and basic policies in Japan, discussing Shogakukan publication
plans, and considering merchandise proposals.[204] For merchandising, the
council set the bar high. Fiercely protective of Pokemon's brand_equity,
Ishihara was unwilling to greenlit an item just because it had a picture of a
Pokemon printed on it. To avoid the market being flooded with low-quality
goods, Ishihara put very specific demands on the products he evaluated.[167]
[205] Furthermore, in most cases, the council opted to contract one company for
each product category.[206] Because of this, most merchandise proposals were
rejected: of the approximately 7,500 applications submitted in 1997, only about
5% was approved.[207]
By March 1998, 35 companies offered licensed Pokemon goods, and there were
approximately 700 Pokemon products.[131][208] Tomy manufactured Pokemon toy
figures and plush dolls.[209] Bandai made Pokemon gashapon, dolls and ramune-
flavored candy in a plastic box in the shape of a Game Boy.[210] Meiji_Seika
produced Pokemon chocolate snacks and pudding.[131][211] The lucrative
franchise provided a much-needed boost to Japan's economy, which was stagnating
in what would later be called the Lost_Decade.[212][213] An example of a firm
that benefited greatly from Pokemon was food manufacturer Nagatanien¬†[jp]. From
May 1997, the company began selling Pokemon-branded curry, furikake, and baking
mixes.[131][214] In December 1997, Nagatanien was hit hard by the collapse of
one of its biggest sales channels, Toshoku, in what was then the third-largest
bankruptcy in Japan's postwar history.[215][216] Nonetheless, due to their
Pokemon-licensed products, Nagatanien reported net profits in fiscal years '97
and '98, despite having forecasted losses.[214][215][217]
*** "Denn≈ç Senshi Porygon" incident ***
See also: Pok√©mon_episodes_removed_from_rotation
In the evening of December 16, 1997, the Pokemon franchise was hit by a crisis
related to the broadcast of the anime's 38th episode, "Denn≈ç_Senshi_Porygon"
(Computer Warrior Porygon). It was watched by approximately 4.6 million
households.[218] In the episode, the cast is transported into a virtual world,
accompanied by a Porygon, a digital, human-made Pokemon. While flying through
cyberspace, they are attacked by an anti-virus program which mistakes them for
viruses, shooting "vaccine missiles" at the group resulting in explosions of
bright, rapidly swapping red and blue flashes.[219]
The intense stimuli brought about by the episode triggered a variety of adverse
health effects in more than 10,000 viewers,[220] primarily irritated eyes,
headaches, dizziness, and nausea.[221] A small part suffered a photosensitive
epileptic seizure, manifested in loss of conscious and/or convulsions.[221]
[222] Hundreds[g] of children were brought to hospitals, although a part of
them had recovered enough upon arrival and did not need to be hospitalized. No
one died. Broadcasting of Pokemon was halted, and new guidelines were
implemented to help prevent similar events from happening.[228] With the show
on hiatus, ShoPro and OLM worked on a feature Pokemon film. By the time the
incident occurred, its script was already written, and the movie was in the
storyboard stage. In mid-January, the staff resumed creating new episodes.[229]
The anime series returned on April 16, 1998.[230] The film, titled Pocket
Monsters the Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back (Pok√©mon:_The_First_Movie), premiered
on July 18, 1998 and became the fourth highest grossing film of the year in
Japan.[231][232]
Ultimately, the incident did not damage the Pokemon franchise ‚Äì it in fact grew
further during and after the anime's hiatus. While video rental tapes were
removed from shelves,[233][234] all other Pokemon products continued to be sold
as usual, and customer demand for them remained high.[235][236] Helping matters
was a general understanding among businesses that the anime was not canceled,
but rather suspended, and many executives (correctly) expected the show to be
resumed after precautions had been taken. Supermarkets and other distribution
outlets responded calmly to the crisis, and did not remove Pokemon products
from their sales floors.[237]
**** 1998‚Äì2000: International expansion ****
*** North America ***
     "When we started this project in Japan, one of the first things I was
     told was that this kind of thing would never appeal to American
     audiences. They said, 'Because the characters are in a very Japanese
     style, you cannot sell them to Americans'. So from the very
     beginning, I never thought there would be an English version. Now,
     it's just as popular in the United States [as in Japan], and I
     realized that we shouldn't always believe the opinions of
     conservative marketers."
Shigeru_Miyamoto, August 1999[238]
Possibly the first person to show interest in a North American launch of
Pokemon was Minoru_Arakawa, founder and then-president of Nintendo_of_America
(NoA). Arakawa visited Japan to participate in Shoshinkai_1996, held November
22‚Äì24. It was around this time when he first played one of the three Pokemon
titles. He thought the games were promising, but Nintendo of Japan (NoJ) had no
plans at the time to release them elsewhere. He returned to America with a few
cartridges and tested the game on his employees ‚Äì they did not believe it would
work in the US.[239] At the time, role-playing_games (RPGs) were not very
popular outside Japan,[240] and NoA executives believed that American children
did not have the attention_span for such a complex title.[241] Americans were
said to be more interested in sport- and action-oriented games, preferably with
realistic graphics.[15][242] Japanese people, by contrast, were alleged to care
more about characters and plot.[243] Up to that point, few Japanese properties
had been successfully mainstreamed in the US, and if they were, it was alleged
to be on account of having been properly Americanized: Mighty_Morphin_Power
Rangers was considered a prime example of this.[244] Visually, Pokemon was
believed to be too kawaii, or cute. It was assumed that Pokemon could not
succeed on cute alone ‚Äì it must also be cool.[245][246] In an effort to enhance
the franchise's coolness, NoA considered a graphical redesign and contracted a
few external artists to create some test-designs for the American market.[241]
[246] The mockups they proposed included 'graffiti style' drawings,[246]
'beefed-up' and more muscular looking Pokemon,[247] and a new Pikachu that
looked like "a tiger with huge breasts".[245] Arakawa concluded that it "didn't
work",[246] and by that time, the anime had begun its production in Japan,
leading NoA to conclude it was too late for a graphical revamp anyway.[241]
Of pivotal importance to Pokemon's global expansion was Alfred_R._Kahn, CEO of
US-based 4Kids_Entertainment, NoA's licensing agent since 1987.[248][249]
Convinced of the franchise's potential, Kahn agreed to invest an undisclosed
sum in return for both the anime and licensing rights.[240] Pokemon became one
of the first Japanese media franchises in which both the localization of the
anime and the licensing of merchandise was handled by a single company, as well
as a non-Japanese company.[250] Kahn suggested to use the short version of the
name, "Pok√©mon", adding an acute_accent (¬¥) over the e to assist with
pronunciation and "give it a little flair".[14] NoJ president Hiroshi_Yamauchi
officially approved the project in late November,[251] and subsequently
announced it at Space_World_1997.[252] However, three weeks later, the "Denn≈ç
Senshi_Porygon" incident happened, which Kubo felt made even more people
resistant to the idea of an overseas introduction.[253]
Market_research turned back negative: American kids reportedly did not like
Pok√©mon.[254] Arakawa ignored the study and, convinced of the franchise's
potential, allocated an enormous budget to Pok√©mon's launch. The exact amount
was not disclosed, but was reportedly equal to or more than $50 million (c.
$93.47 million in 2023), approximately the same amount as the launch budget of
the Nintendo_Entertainment_System in 1985. Arakawa admitted that it was "quite
a bit of money", but NoA "had been doing well for several years, so we had a
lot of money to spare". He opined that if Pok√©mon would be as successful in the
US as it had been in Japan, "an investment of 1 would turn into 100".[255] NoA
and 4Kids proceeded to devise a strategy on how to localize Pok√©mon for the
United States.[241] Arakawa appointed Gail_Tilden to lead the project,
prompting her to leave her position at Nintendo_Power magazine.[256] Tilden
said that they "decided to make an all-out effort to repeat the phenomenon in
the Western world".[25] In two press releases, NoA self-described Pok√©mon's
marketing campaign as "aggressive".[257][258]
The localization of the Pok√©mon_anime was done by 4Kids, and directed by Norman
J._Grossfeld. Grossfeld strongly believed that the anime should be
Americanized.[259] At NATPE 1998, he asked ShoPro for a "kind of carte_blanche,
to let me change the show as I think would work for this market", to which
ShoPro agreed.[260] However, no national TV station was interested in buying
the anime or financing its localization.[14][240] Kahn then decided to self-
finance Pok√©mon's production costs, despite realizing this "could very well
bring down 4Kids" if the show would fail.[260] According to Kahn, they "spend a
fortune" on the localization.[24] To have it broadcast_in_syndication, 4Kids
offered the show for free to local TV stations across the country, in exchange
for a portion of the advertising revenue.[14][240] NoA assisted, persuading
dozens of stations to carry the series by offering to buy some of their
advertisement space, spending a total of $5 million (c. $9.35 million in 2023).
[242][260] Despite all this, most broadcasters were still reluctant to carry
Pok√©mon, with Grossfeld experiencing difficulties getting through their
"preconceived notions or their snobbery for Western-produced animation over
something from Asia".[260] At the time, anime had not yet found mainstream
popularity in the West. Contemporary news reports cited Sailor_Moon[VI] as an
example of an anime that had failed to catch on with American youth.[h] Still,
with NoA's help, 4Kids ultimately succeeded in contracting 112 broadcasters for
Pok√©mon,[266] reaching "about 85 to 90 percent"[267] of television households.
However, many broadcasters gave it off-peak time slots, with starting times
like 06:00 or 06:30.[14][242] Prior to the late 1990s, this was the case for
many anime in the US.[250]
Grossfeld came up with the advertising_slogan "Gotta catch 'em all!" as the
English equivalent to the Japanese Pokemon GETTO daze~! („Éù„Ç±„É¢„É≥„Ç≤„ÉÉ„Éà„Å†„Åú„ÉºÔºÅ, Get (the)
Pok√©mon!).[268][269] The phrase "miraculously managed to gain approval" by the
Federal_Communications_Commission (FCC), which normally prohibits the use of
injunctions in ads_directed_at_children (e.g. "You must buy this!"). While the
tagline does sound commanding, the FCC reasoned that the act of catching is at
the core of Pok√©mon's play. Therefore, the phrase was allowed.[270] The_series'
theme_song was written by John_Loeffler and John Siegler and performed by Jason
Paige.[271] In commissioning the track, Grossfeld specifically requested the
song's chorus to be written around the "Gotta catch 'em all" phrase, firmly
embedding the slogan into the theme.[269]
While NoA and 4Kids were allowed a fair degree of liberty in their localization
of Pok√©mon, the Japanese copyright council, headed by Ishihara, had the last
say over it. All decisions regarding adjustments and promotion had to gain
final approval of the Japan side.[272] This included all of the merchandise,
for which a 'two-step system' was created. All (aspiring) licensees in North
America were to send their merchandise proposals to 4Kids.[240] Staff of both
4Kids and NoA then made a pre-selection and send the approved proposals to
Japan, where the council made the final decision. Many submissions were bounced
at the US stage, and thus never got sent to Japan. Tilden noted that processing
all license applications, and mailing all approved prototypes and their
documentation to Japan, was a lot of work. Arakawa did consider streamlining
the process by moving someone from Japan to the US, but no person could be
found who was as competent as Ishihara.[273]
The Pok√©mon anime was first broadcast on September 7, 1998.[274][275] Pok√©mon
Red_Version_and_Blue_Version were released three weeks later, on September 28,
1998.[276] To localize the card game, Nintendo contracted Wizards_of_the_Coast,
the creator of Magic:_The_Gathering.[277] The Pok√©mon_Trading_Card_Game was
officially launched nationwide on January 9, 1999, although pre-sold in select
stores in December.[278] Coinciding with the North American launch of Pok√©mon
was the release of the Game_Boy_Color on 23 November 1998.[279]
*** Other regions ***
The American version of the Pok√©mon anime started broadcasting in Australia and
New_Zealand on September 28, 1998. Red and Blue were subsequently released
there on October 23. Various territories in Asia followed: the anime series
debuted in Hong_Kong on November 16, in Taiwan on November 23, in Shanghai on
November 24, in Beijing on January 10, 1999, and in South_Korea on July 14,
1999.[280]
Outside North America, 4Kids distributed the anime in cooperation with Brian
Lacey of Lacey_Entertainment.[281][282] The series was presented at MIP_TV, in
Cannes, France, from April 3‚Äì8, 1998.[283] Broadcasters were initially not
interested due to its Japanese origins, and preferred to wait and see how the
anime would fare in the US. After its American success, Lacey received
inquiries about the series throughout 1999 from multiple international
broadcasters.[281][284] Lacey noted that, in Europe, this was a stark contrast
compared to previous years: "I was trying to sell this sort of stuff for years
and buyers would tell me they were moving away from Japanese_animation shows",
he said.[284] In October 1999, the franchise was launched in the European key
markets of Germany, the United_Kingdom, France, and Spain.[285] The anime
started broadcasting in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden in December 1999.[284] In
2000, broadcasting rights for the first season were secured by TV stations in
South_Africa, Russia, Iceland, and Finland.[286] In Israel, the anime debuted
in February 2000. For unclear reasons, Red and Blue were not officially
released there. Thriving only on the strength of the TV series, The First
Movie, the cards, and imported_video_games, the Israeli Pok√©mon still became a
success.[287][288]
By the end of 2000, Pok√©mon games had been released in 70 countries, the anime
was broadcast in 51 countries, the films were released in 33 countries, and the
cards had been translated into 11 languages.[289]
**** 1999‚Äì2000: Pok√©mania ****
In North America, the debuting Pok√©mon franchise quickly rose to success. Red
and_Blue sold 200,000 copies in its first month. By December 1998, the Pok√©mon
anime had become the highest-rated syndicated children's show during the
weekdays.[281] This attracted the attention of two media companies: Warner
Bros., co-owner of The_WB channel; and Saban_Entertainment/Fox_Family
Worldwide, owners of the Fox_Kids channel. A bidding war ensued between the
parties, which was won by Warner Bros.[290] On February 13, 1999, Pok√©mon
launched on the Kids'_WB national television block. The debut episode became
the most watched premiere in Kids' WB's history.[291] In European countries,
the anime received similar levels of success. For example, in Germany, "a
highly competitive kids market", Pok√©mon was purchased by RTL_2. The show's
popularity bolstered the entire program block, more than tripling its viewers.
Andrea Lang, RTL 2's editor of cartoons and children's programs, said: "We were
speechless. We've never had a comparable success".[284] By March 1998, half a
year before Pok√©mon's overseas launch, 499 million Pok√©mon cards had been
produced. By March 1999, the total number of cards shipped reached 764 million.
By March 2000, this figure would grow further to 4.255 billion cards,
manufactured in both Japanese and American factories.[163]
By April 1999, there was a general consensus in the US that Pok√©mon had become
a phenomenon and the newest children's fad.[VII] By some, the fad was referred
to as "Pok√©mania",[VIII] including journalists of Time[25] and USA_Today.[299]
In the US, severe scarcity occurred of Pok√©mon goods,[23] especially Pok√©mon
cards,[300] causing companies to miss profits.[301] A Milwaukee_Journal
Sentinel article, published on August 3, 1999, cited a Toys_"R"_Us manager as
saying that a supply of 600 booster_packs would last 24 hours. The CEO of one
card distributor stated that they were "thousands of boxes behind" on orders.
In the same article, a Wizards spokeswoman stated that more employees and
printers had been hired to increase card production.[302] However, near the end
of the month, a different Wizards spokeswoman told The_Washington_Post that
they had "exhausted most of the card-printing capacity of the United States".
[15] Similarly, USA Today reported in November 1999 that factories making
Hasbro's Pok√©mon toys had expanded production by 20 times, but demand still
exceeded supply.[303] In Europe, scarcity of Pok√©mon merchandise also occurred.
[284]
In part due to the Pok√©mon craze, Nintendo saw a 250% increase in profits in
1999 compared to the previous year,[15] reaching a six-year high.[304] The
Pok√©mon franchise accounted for over 30% of Nintendo's revenue that year.[305]
Pok√©mon's popularity also caused a sharp increase in sales of the Game Boy
line.[241][306][307] The financial windfalls came at a time when Nintendo lost
dominance in the home console market, with the Nintendo_64 being outsold by
Sony's PlayStation.[308][309][310] The global success of Pok√©mon compensated
this loss somewhat.[IX] Buckingham & Sefton-Green went even further, writing in
2004: "while Nintendo is now among Japan's most profitable corporations, it
could be argued that the company would have struggled to survive without
Pok√©mon".[315]
4Kids, initially a little-known firm,[240][248] expanded thirty times in
revenues,[316] and was named the fastest-growing company in America in the
September 4, 2000 issue of Fortune magazine.[249][317][318] Many businesses
that timely obtained a Pok√©mon license reaped considerable profits.[316][319]
In the summer of 1999, a massive run on stocks of publicly traded Pok√©mon
licensees caused their value to increase dramatically. However, by November,
most investors were shorting their shares. Realizing that Pok√©mon was a fad
that would peak and fall at some point, investors were bearish about its
prospects.[320]
Pok√©mon:_The_First_Movie premiered in North America on November 12, 1999, and
in Europe the following year. Despite being negatively received by many Western
critics, it became one of the most successful Japanese animated films of all
time.[321] In the United States, November 1999 was estimated to have been the
peak of Pok√©mania.[X] Supporting the American release of The First Movie was a
promotional action with Burger_King, one of the largest in the history of the
fast-food_industry.[326][327][328] The success of the promotion resulted in
supply issues; restaurants often ran out of Pok√©mon toys to include with their
meals.[329][330] On December 27,[331] Burger King recalled_its_Pok√©_Ball_toy
after a 13-month-old girl died suffocating on one.[332][333]
Pok√©mon_Gold_and_Silver, the successors to Red/Green/Blue, were released in
North America on October 15, 2000.[334] In Europe, they were released on April
6, 2001.[335]

Pok√©mon merchandise shop in Sunshine_City, Ikebukuro.[336]
On April 23, 1998, Pok√©mon Center Co. Ltd. was founded as a joint_venture by
Nintendo, Creatures, and Game Freak.[337] It was initially formed for the
management of specialized merchandise stores called Pokemon Centers, of which
the first location opened in Nihonbashi, Tokyo, on July 18, 1998.[338][339]
Throughout the years, multiple Japanese Pok√©mon Centers would open and close.
As of January¬†2024[update], a total of 24 Pok√©mon merchandise shops exist in
Japan.[340] An American Pok√©mon Center also existed in New_York_City from 2001
[341] to 2005.[342] It was then remodelled into Nintendo World,[343] later
renamed Nintendo_New_York.[344]
After the release of Gold and Silver, Tsunekazu Ishihara began setting out a
number of long-term goals for the Pok√©mon franchise, which included releasing a
movie every year.[i] As part of Ishihara's plan, the Pokemon Center Co. Ltd.
was reformatted into The_Pok√©mon_Company (TPC), and officially renamed in
October 2000.[338][345] The goal of TPC is to centralize and streamline the
global management of Pok√©mon.[346] Satoru_Iwata, who had joined Nintendo of
Japan in June, was involved with the company's creation, which was one of his
first jobs at Nintendo.[345]
In February 2001, Pok√©mon_USA (PUSA) was established, an affiliated firm of The
Pok√©mon Company.[338] The company's first president was Tatsumi_Kimishima (who
would later become president of NoA, and subsequently president of NoJ).[347]
In 2002, Kimishima was succeeded by Akira_Chiba.[348]
**** 2001‚Äì2006: End of the craze, business reforms ****
In North America, Pok√©mania peaked in 1999, slowing down throughout the next
year.[349] On April 29, 2000, the anime was bumped off Kids'_WB's #1 spot after
holding it for 54 weeks. Around the same time, Pok√©mon was surpassed at Fox
Kids by its rival Digimon.[350] In Europe, the craze peaked in 2000.[351][352]
On January 20, 2001, The New York Times reported that Pok√©mon's trading card
market had collapsed in the US.[353] A June 2001 survey in the United Kingdom
confirmed that Pok√©mon's popularity was waning there.[354] Tobin (2004) wrote:
"By the summer of 2001, Pok√©mon's shelf space in Japanese and U.S. toy stores
was but a fraction of what it enjoyed in the fall of 1999".[355] By the end of
2001, Pok√©mania was fading globally, and by 2002, the fad was largely over.
[356]
From 2000 to 2002, Game Freak developed Pok√©mon_Ruby_and_Sapphire, the
successors to Gold and Silver, for the newly released Game_Boy_Advance. Masuda,
who was appointed to assistant director during Gold and Silver,[357] was
promoted to director for Ruby and Sapphire, with Tajiri making himself
executive director.[358] Masuda was concerned that the end of Pok√©mania
indicated the end of Pok√©mon as a whole: "After Gold and Silver came out, it
was a huge hit around the world, but shortly after everyone was saying, 'That's
it. The Pok√©mon fad is over! It's dead!'."[359] Determined to keep the
franchise going, GF not only wanted to "prove people wrong" with Ruby and
Sapphire, but already started planning their sequels: Diamond_and_Pearl (2006).
They also began planning remakes of older installments, starting with FireRed
and_LeafGreen (2004), remakes of the original Red_and_Green.[359]
Ruby and Sapphire were released in Japan on November 21, 2002, and in the rest
of the world the next year. The games introduced 135 new Pok√©mon, bringing the
total amount to 386. Because of this, Golin_Harris, NoA's ad agency,[241]
advised them to move away from the "Gotta catch 'em all!" slogan. They reasoned
that if new, younger players were drawn into the franchise with Ruby/Sapphire,
they would find the concept of "catching them all" to be a daunting, if not,
impossible task if they didn't also have Red/Blue/Yellow and Gold/Silver/
Crystal.[360] Dockery (2022) noted that "from both a marketing perspective and,
really, a legal perspective, it would not be to the company's advantage to keep
pushing that slogan".[360]
By 2002, the relationship between Pok√©mon_USA (PUSA) and Wizards of the Coast
had deteriorated. That year, at least seven high-profile employees were poached
from Wizards by PUSA: Wizard's former art director, senior graphic designer,
business manager, events marketing director, project management director, and
two vice presidents. All employees had signed NDAs.[361][362] In March 2003,
PUSA told Wizards that their contract would not be renewed, and that Wizards
would not be distributing the new Ruby & Sapphire card set.[363] Later, Wizards
was also prohibited from releasing the sets Jamboree and Legendary Collection
II.[364] Notably, Jamboree was the first set containing cards designed by
Wizards themselves. As considerable time and money was invested into creating
them, Wizards was upset when they were barred from putting them out. On October
1, 2003, the day after their agreement expired, Wizards filed suit against
Pok√©mon USA, alleging that the defendant had seized their intellectual property
and trade secrets, and illegally tried to gain advantage over them in the
competitive trading card market.[361][362] The case was settled out of court.
[365] Jamboree and Legendary Collection II have remained unreleased.[362]
In October 2001, 4Kids_Entertainment signed a new contract with PUSA,
continuing to serve as Pok√©mon's exclusive licensing agent and anime localizer.
[346] On December 23, 2005, it was announced that the agreement would not be
renewed and would expire on December 31, with PUSA moving all licensing in-
house.[366][367] The localization of the anime would be done by PUSA in
cooperation with TAJ Productions. PUSA proceeded to replace almost all of the
original English voice actors, who were still under contract with 4Kids.[368]
This decision "raised the ire of fans and the actors themselves".[369]
According to Stuart_Zagnit, who voiced Professor_Oak, the recasting was done to
cut back on costs.[368]
In March 2003, Pok√©mon UK was established in London as a British representative
of The_Pok√©mon_Company.[338]
**** 2006‚Äì2012: Generation IV‚ÄìV, TPCi established ****
Following Ruby and Sapphire, Pok√©mon_Diamond_and_Pearl were released for the
Nintendo_DS on September 28, 2006 in Japan[370] and on April 22, 2007 in North
America.[371] A third version, Pok√©mon_Platinum, was released on September 28,
2008 in Japan[372] and on March 22, 2009 in North America.[373] They form the
fourth generation (Generation IV) in the Pok√©mon video game series.[374]
Diamond and Pearl were designed based on the DS's various features such as its
Wi-Fi capabilities and slot for Game Boy Advance cartridge.[375] Pok√©mon
president Tsunekazu Ishihara dubbed the games as the "ultimate" Pok√©mon titles
because they allowed the player to trade and battle Pok√©mon including every
Pok√©mon from previous iterations globally through WiFi, as opposed to
previously only able to do so locally and with fewer Pok√©mon.[376] The games'
characters are 2D and the environments are rendered in 3D, and it is
considerably difficult to differentiate them because Game Freak designed them
this way to innovate the graphics while also retaining the traditional game
style and feel.[377][378]
In Platinum, the developers focused on changing the most essential elements
from Diamond and Pearl to maintain continuity with the previous games. Director
Junichi_Masuda stated that since they designed Diamond and Pearl as the
"ultimate" Pok√©mon titles, it was only necessary to make Platinum "even
stronger" than them. They approached this by designing the "Origin Forme" for
the legendary Pok√©mon Giratina, ensuring that the design would appear
significantly different from its regular form in Diamond and Pearl and to
express the games' core antimatter and Distortion World concepts.[379] The
title Platinum was chosen to reflect a precious_material that "shines" and is
different from diamond and pearl and their associations of "love" and
"happiness" respectively.[380]
Pok√©mon_HeartGold_and_SoulSilver were released on September 12, 2009 in Japan
and on March 14, 2010 in North America as part of Generation IV.[381][382] They
are remakes of Gold and Silver,[383] aiming to balance familiarity for the
original games' players and new content for newcomers.[384] The titles
reflected the theme of the bond between trainers and their Pok√©mon.[384] The
developers faithfully recreated the original story and added elements from the
Generation IV games and Yellow, the latter of which was released concurrently
with Gold and Silver.[384][385]
In 2009, Pok√©mon USA and Pok√©mon UK merged to form The_Pok√©mon_Company
International (TPCi).[12] This subsidiary of The_Pok√©mon_Company (TPC) has
since managed the Pok√©mon franchise outside of Asia.[13]
In Generation V, Pok√©mon_Black_and_White were released on September 18, 2010 in
Japan for the DS[386] and on March 6, 2011 in North America.[387] The games
feature enhanced visual effects and increased use of 3D graphics. The
developers excluded old Pok√©mon and strategies, while introducing over 150 new
Pok√©mon to evoke a sense of novelty and to provide new players a more "leveled
playing field" against old players.[388] The games seek to attract both new
players and returning players through its detailed walkthrough and the addition
of C-Gear (a real-time communication tool to improve the trade and battle
experiences), respectively.[389]
The games were followed by Pok√©mon_Black_2_and_White_2, which were released on
June 23, 2012 in Japan[390] and on October 7, 2012 in North America.[391] The
games were developed for the DS rather than the more powerful Nintendo_3DS to
maintain continuity with the game world in Black and White and they were
presented from a different perspective in the storyline.[392] Since the games
are their first sequels, director Masuda explained that they have strived to
find a "fine balance" to appeal to both newcomers and returning players by
implementing introductory explanations, and by placing a Pok√©mon_Center in the
first in-game city, they were able to further this approach by providing
newcomers with a detailed walkthrough and also returning players with new
updates.[393] During development phase, director Takao Unno revealed that they
had experimented with a 100-player multiplayer experience via their
communication feature Entralink drawing from their vision of players "sharing
the same space, same time and same game" but this feature was never implemented
due to technical limitations.[394]
**** 2013‚Äì2018: 3D, Generation VI‚ÄìVII, Pok√©mon Go ****
In Generation VI, Pok√©mon_X_and_Y were released worldwide for the 3DS on
October 12, 2013,[395] and they are the first games to be released in this way.
The developers focused on the themes of "beauty", "bond", and "evolution", and
it is based on these themes that they created the games' core mechanic where
Pok√©mon could achieve a higher form of evolution by strengthening their bonds
with trainers; however, to maintain game balance, they limited this feature to
a special, temporary phenomenon.[396] The games' shift to fully 3D graphics
allowed the player to freely manipulate the camera angles although due to
technical limitations objects far away are rendered in lower polygon_models,
and producer Hitoshi Yamagami addressed to 2D players that "Game Freak
[developers are also] big fans of 2D graphics... So there are some elements in
there that I [Yamagami] think fans of 2D will appreciate as well."[397] When
asked about the Horde battle and Sky battle types, he stated that Horde battles
are to supplant the roles of "really strong pokemon [sic]" to help the player
more easily progress through the games and also to add "more excitement to the
battles and a sense of danger," and that they added the Sky battles to take
advantage of the games' 3D camera angels capabilities.[398]
Pok√©mon_Omega_Ruby_and_Alpha_Sapphire were released worldwide for the 3DS on
November 21, 2014[399] and on November 28, 2014 in Europe as part of Generation
VI.[400] They are remakes of Ruby_and_Sapphire.[401] The developers adopted X
and Y's core game mechanic and added enhanced 3D graphics.[402] According to
director Masuda, they reviewed the original mechanic and concept and expressed
them using modern hardware, such as replacing the original Pok√©Gear feature for
the enhanced versions BuzzNav and DexNav to more effectively provide
information enabled by the games' hardware capabilities. They seek to explore
the concept of Pok√©mon coexisting with humans and nature, revisiting the
concept behind original games' setting, which translated to "richness or
abundance in nature and bonds between people and nature" in Japanese. To appeal
to the newer audience in X and Y, the developers decided to connect the story
with X and Y by further exploring their core mechanic.[403]
In Generation VII, Pok√©mon_Sun_and_Moon were released worldwide for the 3DS on
November 18, 2016 and on November 23, 2016 in Europe.[404] The developers chose
Hawaii for inspiration due to its distinctive warm sunlight and clear moonlight
and unique biomes that helped support the games' regional Pok√©mon variance
concept. Ohmori said, as director, he aimed to focus on the concept of "Pok√©mon
as these living creatures, [and really focus] on them being alive." Having the
release date on the 20th anniversary of Pok√©mon in mind, he treated this
project as a "celebration of that life, and to really express this respect for
life." As he contemplated about life and its origins, Ohmori considered the
significance of the Sun, enabling life with its light, and the Moon's impact on
certain species' reproduction. He explained how the Sun, the Moon, and the
Earth "work [together] to influence [one another], and life as a result grows
and flourishes based on [this] relationship."[405]
Ohmori stated that with the innovation to 3D in X and Y the designers decided
to examine more minor aspects concerning with the Pok√©mon themselves such as
their motions, such as when they designed the games' first starter Pok√©mon to
capitalize on its owl-like characteristics with its head "twists round and
round." With the 3DS technologies, the developers are able to design the
characters to be more expressive as themselves including different facial
expressions and reactions. In addition to portraying Pok√©mon harmoniously
coexisting with people and vice versa in the games, the developers replaced the
traditional Gym mechanic with Island Trials, deepening the players' connection
with the story and their Pok√©mon.[406] The enhanced versions Pok√©mon_Ultra_Sun
and_Ultra_Moon were released worldwide on November 17, 2017.[407] The games
added an alternate storyline and additional characters, Pok√©mon, and other
features.[408] Developer Shigeki_Morimoto revealed that they were developed by
the younger staff members and veterans so the more veterans can prioritized on
developing more important titles,[409] and the developers considered them to be
their culmination with the 3DS.[410]

In 2016, the Pok√©mon franchise spawned a second worldwide fad with the release
of Pok√©mon_Go, a mobile augmented_reality_game. The app originated as a Google
April_Fools'_Day_joke in 2014: the "Google_Maps_Pok√©mon_Challenge". The prank
was conceived by Tsunekazu_Ishihara and Satoru_Iwata.[411] On Ishihara's
initiation,[412] the hoax was turned into an actual video game developed by
Niantic. Ishihara was a fan of Niantic's previous transreality_game, Ingress,
and saw the game's concept as a perfect match for Pok√©mon.[412]
Through in-game purchases, the game generated more than $160 million by the end
of July 2016,[413] with App Annie reporting that Pok√©mon Go had generated
around $10 million in revenue every day that month.[414] The same month, Sensor
Tower reported that the game had passed more than $200 million in worldwide
revenue, beating every existing record set by Clash_of_Clans and Candy_Crush by
a wide margin.[415] The average daily usage of the app on Android devices in
July 2016 exceeded that of Snapchat, Tinder, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.
[416] By September 2, 2016, Pok√©mon Go had generated more than $440 million in
worldwide revenue, according to Sensor Tower.[417] By September 30, it had
received 500 million downloads and grossed $470 million in 80 days, according
to market research firm Newzoo.[418] Pok√©mon Go reached the milestone of $600
million in revenue after only 90 days on the market, becoming the fastest
mobile game ever to do so.[419]
Pok√©mon:_Let's_Go,_Pikachu!_and_Let's_Go,_Eevee! were released for the Nintendo
Switch on November 16, 2018. They are part of Generation VII.[420] Inspired by
Pok√©mon_Yellow, the games seek to introduce newcomers and a new generation of
players (particularly Pok√©mon Go players) to the Pok√©mon series in addition to
catering old players. As such, the games feature similar capture mechanics to
Go where the player throws Pok√© Balls to catch wild Pok√©mon rather than
battling them like traditional Pok√©mon games. In addition, the games feature
the same setting and characters as the first generation of games and the
original animated series, and include exclusively the original 151 Pok√©mon to
further appeal to their targeted audience.[421][422] The only new Pok√©mon
featured are Meltan and Melmetal.[423]
**** 2019‚Äìpresent: Generation VIII‚ÄìIX, open-world gameplay ****
Generation VIII[424] debuted with the release of Pok√©mon_Sword_and_Shield on
November 15, 2019 for the Switch.[425] Director Shigeru Ohmori stated that they
designed the games based on what they believed of the biggest Pok√©mon theme of
becoming/being "the greatest or strongest", which was expressed in the games'
Dynamax_/_Gigantamax Pok√©mon core mechanic and the games' increasingly powerful
software and hardware capabilities. Ohmori further revealed that through
developing the Let's Go games as research projects for the Switch, they were
able to gain valuable experiences and knowledge to develop Sword and Shield. He
noted that they took advantage of the Switch's high resolution and TV
connectivity to implement the games' gigantic-size core Pok√©mon mechanic. They
envisioned the games' setting to be a "wide-open space" that is different from
the traditional route systems and is constantly changing where the player can
meet and explore with other players.[426]
Many pre-existing Pok√©mon are not available in Sword and Shield. This "Dexit",
as it was called, led to fan backlash.[427] Sword and Shield were the first
Pok√©mon games to receive DLC expansions: Part 1‚ÄîThe_Isle_of_Armor, and Part
2‚ÄîThe_Crown_Tundra; they were released on June 17, 2020 and October 22, 2020
respectively.[428] They include additional storylines, places, Pok√©mon,
characters, and other features.[429]
In 2020, the COVID-19_pandemic broke out. The resulting widespread ennui and
excessive leisure time inspired a resurgence in popularity and interest of
Pok√©mon cards,[430] which was further popularized by various YouTubers and
other influencers, such as Logan_Paul.[431][432] The craze resulted in severe
supply shortages, and customers' inappropriate and obsessive behavior raised
safety concerns in many retail outlets. Pok√©mon cards' values skyrocketed,
prompting collectors to submit cards and overwhelm card_grading_agencies.[433]
[434] The Pok√©mon Company responded by reprinting impacted products at maximum
capacity to ensure price stabilization and general accessibility.[435]
Remakes of Diamond and Pearl, Pok√©mon_Brilliant_Diamond_and_Shining_Pearl were
released on November 19, 2021 for the Switch as part of Generation VIII.[436]
They are the first core_series games to be developed by a third-party
developer, ILCA, rather than Game Freak.[437] The developers revealed that the
games would not assume the anticipated style of the Let's Go Games and feature
traditional game mechanics.[438] Pok√©mon intends to celebrate their 25th
anniversary with the release of the remakes by revisiting old games and
mechanics, which they faithfully reproduced with enhanced 3D graphics.[439]
[440]
Pok√©mon_Legends:_Arceus was released on January 28, 2022 for the Switch as a
prequel to Diamond and Pearl.[441] It is part of Generation VIII.[442] The game
"represents a new approach for the Pok√©mon video game series" as it transitions
from traditional RPG mechanics to add real-time elements in their games. Unlike
traditional Pok√©mon games, the player can catch Pok√©mon by throwing a Pok√© Ball
in real-time rather than triggering a battle; however, they can still choose
the latter to weaken it for capture. Many in-game aspects, particularly its
landscape, heavily resemble those of The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild.
[443][444][445]
Generation IX[446] was introduced with the release of Pok√©mon_Scarlet_and
Violet for the Switch on November 18, 2022. The games are the first Pok√©mon
games to feature an entirely open-world experience as opposed to the partially
open-world experience in previous Pok√©mon games such as Sword and Shield, and
it also departed from the traditional gym mechanics and the elite four battles
to opt for unique road quests. The games' improved multiplayer experience
allowed for up to four players to travel together.[447][448] Their DLC, The
Hidden_Treasure_of_Area_Zero, consists of two parts, The Teal Mask and The
Indigo Disk; The Teal Mask was released on September 12‚Äì13, 2023[449] and The
Indigo Disk was released on December 14, 2023.[450] An epilogue to The Hidden
Treasure of Area Zero was released on January 11, 2024.[451]
On 27 February 2024, TPCi announced Pok√©mon_Legends:_Z-A, set to release in
2025 for the Switch.[452][453] It is part of Generation IX. A successor to
Legends: Arceus, this game acts as a prequel to X and Y.

Pok√©mon video games have been released in a wide variety of genres. The role-
playing_games (RPGs) developed by Game_Freak are considered the core series of
the franchise.[454][455][456] Various spin-off games also exist, such as
Pok√©mon_Mystery_Dungeon, a roguelike_RPG series, Pok√©mon_Ranger, an action_RPG
series, and Detective_Pikachu (2018), an adventure_game. Pok√©mon games, in
particular the core RPGs, are commonly classified in generations. For example,
Junichi_Masuda referred to Diamond_and_Pearl (2006) as Gen 4,[457] and X_and_Y
(2013) as the 6th generation.[458]
Until 2011, Pok√©mon games were released exclusively on Nintendo's_consoles.
With the rise of the smartphone during the 2010s, The_Pok√©mon_Company also
began developing, publishing, and licensing Pok√©mon titles for the mobile phone
market, most notably Pok√©mon_Go (2016), an augmented_reality_game developed by
Niantic that spawned a worldwide craze in the summer of 2016.[418][419]
According to the official website of The_Pok√©mon_Company, as of March¬†2024
[update], over 480 million Pok√©mon game units have been sold worldwide.[459]

The Pok√©mon_Trading_Card_Game (PTCG) was one of the first collectable_card
games (CCGs) in Japan. It was inspired by Magic:_The_Gathering.[146][147][148]
In the card game, the players use a 60-card deck featuring Basic and evolved
Pok√©mon, Energy cards, and Trainer cards to help them knock out the opponent's
Pok√©mon, drawing prize cards and winning the game.[460] Cards are classified
into various levels of rarity, ranging from Common to Rare Holofoil with a
holographic illustration. Rare cards, including limited edition, exclusive
cards, and older cards, are highly valued among collectors due to their
scarcity.[461][462]
According to the official website of The_Pok√©mon_Company, 64.8 billion cards
have been produced as of March¬†2024[update].[459]

started airing on 14 April 2023. The anime originally focused on Ash_Ketchum
and his travels across the Pok√©mon world with his partner, Pikachu. They were
retired as protagonists after the 25th season,[463] and Pok√©mon Horizons
introduced two new protagonists, Liko and Roy.[464] A total of 23_anime_films
have been released, the most recent being Pok√©mon_the_Movie:_Secrets_of_the

In 1999 and 2000, Pok√©mon was an unprecedented, ubiquitous fad in the Western
world. Time magazine described it as "a multimedia and interactive barrage like
no other before it".[25] The franchise, primarily aimed at children, elicited
mixed responses from parents and teachers, some of them critical. Yano (2004)
even claimed that the reactions at one point constituted a moral_panic.[473]
The bulk of the criticism on Pok√©mon was directed at the_trading_cards,[474] in
particular the booster_packs, sealed packages of 11[f] randomly inserted cards
that were sold separately from the main sets. The cards are of varying
scarcity, the most valuable being the "holofoil cards" (also called
"holographic" or "foil cards"), in which the illustrations of the Pok√©mon have
a shiny overlay effect. The rare cards can only be found in booster packs, and
the rarest ones are very infrequently included. Tobin (2004) notes that rarity
in this case is "artificially created", and "effectively a form of gambling" in
which children need to repeatedly purchase booster packs to get more rare
cards.[475] Broug√®re (2004) described a cynicism among adults that corporations
could apparently, "out of thin air", ascribe value to cards which they saw as
valueless, thereby "deceiving vulnerable young consumers and garnering
excessive profits".[474]
As the franchise's popularity grew, children began taking their Pok√©mon cards
to school for trading and playing. Soon, the cards were alleged to be
"disrupting learning, poisoning playground friendships and causing such
distraction that some children forget their homework, tune out in class and
even miss school buses as they scramble to acquire one more card".[476] The
cards were "turning the playground into a black market",[477] with card swaps
sometimes inciting conflicts. Certain children engaged in "aggressive trading",
[478] tricking other (often younger) kids into unfair deals, forcing teachers
to arbitrate.[XI] Some parents expressed their concerns about the craze, but
feared that their children would be ostracized if they were to deny them
Pok√©mon products.[478][483][484] In the US, the Pok√©mon cards ended up "almost
universally banned" from school grounds.[485] Similar bans occurred in Canada,
[486][487] Australia,[488] New Zealand,[489] and European countries.[478][490]
[491] In September 1999, US-based law firm Milberg filed a class-action_lawsuit
against Nintendo of America, Wizards of the Coast, and 4Kids. The suit claimed
that the booster packs constitute a form of lottery and promote gambling in
kids.[492][493] Susan_Estrich noted that similar lawsuits had been filed
against trading-card makers in the US, without success.[494] The Pok√©mon card
suit is not known to have gone to court, and is believed to have been settled.
[j]
The Pok√©mon_anime_series was criticized by some as "cheap Japanese animation"
[496] that is "violent"[26][497][498] and has "little educational value".[499]
Michelle Orecklin of Time dismissed the TV series as "less a cartoon than a
half-hour exercise in Pok√©mon product placement".[500] Allison (2006) wrote
that even those within Pok√©mon's US marketing team agreed that the anime's
visuals were "not especially sophisticated" compared to Disney cartoons.[496]
Pok√©mon:_The_First_Movie premiered in the United States on November 12, 1999,
and in European countries in February 2000. While a huge box-office success,
the film was received negatively by several Western film critics.[501][502] The
Guardian decried it as a "contemptuously cheap animated cash-in on the monster
kids' craze".[503] The American adult animated series South_Park satirized
Pok√©mon in the episode "Chinpokomon", aired on November 3, 1999. In the
episode, the titular media franchise is portrayed as a low-quality line of
products that is part of an evil plan by the Japanese government to invade the
US. South Park co-creator Matt_Stone commented that, at the time, Pok√©mon was
"scary huge".[504]
Kohler (2004) wrote that Pok√©mon was considered "ruthlessly commercial", and
that it "program[med] children to be consumers of anything and everything
Pok√©mon".[505] CNN quoted child psychiatrist John Lochridge as worrying that
"Pok√©mon's creators and marketers deliberately set out to create a fantasy
world so compelling that children would quickly become obsessed". He believed
that kids were being "brainwashed", and said: "I have had parents tell me that
they cannot get their kids to do anything except Pok√©mon, so this stuff seems
to really capture their minds, in a way".[5] These concerns were countered by
psychologist William_Damon, who told Newsweek that obsessing is in fact a
normal part of a child's neurological development. It should concern parents
only when the obsession gets dangerous or excessive.[506] An op-ed in the New
Zealander newspaper The_Dominion_Post claimed that the anti-Pok√©mon sentiment
was particularly American: "The backlash, which seems largely confined to the
United States, may be no more than the sound of the world's leading cultural
imperialist gagging on a taste of its own medicine".[507]
As Pok√©mania built, Western media started reporting on several crimes
associated with Pok√©mon. These included violence[488][508] (including two
reported stabbings),[509][510] burglaries,[511][512] robberies[508][513] (some
at knifepoint),[514][515] and shoplifting.[516][517] Almost all these incidents
were connected to the Pok√©mon cards, and the individuals involved were almost
always underage. In the US, the incidents peaked in November 1999.[322] In
England, Pok√©mon-related delinquency reached a head in April 2000.[514][518]
High prices on the grey_market were a motive behind some of the crimes, "posing
a great temptation for older kids and bullies to take advantage of weaker
children".[519] At specialty shops and online auctions, a rare Pok√©mon card
could be bought and sold for $50 or more (c. $91 in 2023).[520]
Aside from the negative reactions, many media also cited alleged beneficial
effects of Pok√©mon.[521][522][523] It was noted that the video games and the
cards require children to read, memorize, calculate, and plan out a strategy.
[4][163][524] Both encourage socialization, and trading Pok√©mon requires
negotiating skills.[5][15][21] Stephanie_Strom wrote in The_New_York_Times that
the Pok√©mon anime taught children "traditional Japanese values -
- responsibility, empathy, cooperation, obedience, respect for elders,
humility".[525] Anne_Allison interviewed various American parents during
Pok√©mania. She found that while most of them were "utterly mystified" about
Pok√©mon, few were overly worried about it, instead meeting the craze with
"befuddled acceptance". Allison also notes that the Columbine_High_School
massacre occurred during Pok√©mania (on April 20, 1999), causing violent
television, music, and games to be scrutinized. Compared to these media, she
notes, Pok√©mon is in fact rather tame.[526]
In contrast, Pok√©mon received far less criticism in its native country of
Japan. Yano (2004) attributes this to cultural_differences, which includes: 1)
greater acceptance of exuberant consumerism ‚Äì to buy is to be a good citizen;
2) less focus on media_influence ‚Äì instead, Japan's_educational_system,
bullying, and dysfunctional families are more often the target of attention; 3)
less separation between child- and adulthood ‚Äì what is suitable for adults is
not necessarily considered unsuitable for kids; 4) Pok√©mon being permeated with
kawaisa (cuteness), a hallmark of Japanese culture; 5) Japan's core religions,
Buddhism and Shinto, are less moralizing in nature.[527] However, Oliver
Burkeman wrote in The_Guardian that the Pok√©mon cards were also banned from
some Japanese schools.[28]

After World_War_II, Japan experienced a_period_of_unprecedented_growth and
became well-known in the Western world for its consumer products, such as
radios (e.g. Panasonic, Toshiba), cars (e.g. Toyota, Mitsubishi), and Sony's
Walkman.[528] From 1991 onwards, its_economy_stagnated, causing the country to
lose its status as an economic superpower. However, during the 1990s and 2000s,
Japan re-emerged as a source of 'cool' cultural goods, embraced by a growing
international audience interested in Japanese_culture.[XII] Nintendo, Sega, and
Sony launched several popular video game consoles and franchises.[243][533]
[534] In terms of children's properties, the success of Mighty_Morphin_Power
Rangers changed perceptions on the viability of such Japanese imports in the
West.[535][536][537] The Tamagotchi fad (1997‚Äì98),[538] centered around a
portable digital_pet device, was said to have "paved the way for Pok√©mon".[242]
Anne_Allison (2006) wrote that, before the 1990s, Japan figured little in the
face of the worldwide hegemony of Euro-American cultural industries, in
particular that of the US. "Hollywood has been hostile to imports", she wrote,
"and foreignness has largely been, and been seen as, an impediment to mass
popularization in the United States".[539] The surprise success of Pok√©mon was
"an undeniable breakthrough in the homeland of Disney" that "changed
preexisting assumptions about the US marketplace at the same time that it was
constantly resisted for deviating from them".[540] Pok√©mon was a welcomed boon
to Japan's faltering economy,[212] and positively influenced the country's soft
power.[541][542] Kamo (2000) interviewed various American children and found
that kids who thought Pok√©mon was cool, were more likely to believe that Japan
was a cool nation.[543] Allison (2003) gave a similar finding: all the children
she interviewed knew where Pok√©mon originated, and "many said that, as a result
of Pok√©mon and other 'cool' Japanese goods, they had developed an interest in
Japan. A number said that they now wanted to study Japanese and travel there
one day".[544] Kohler (2004) wrote: "Japanese are proud of Pok√©mon, the most
successful export of Japanese popular culture ever".[545] Although, Iwabuchi
(2004) questioned to what extent Pok√©mon really is 'Japanese', and to what
extent it is simply a good property with universal appeal. He noted that
Japanese_nationalist commentators celebrated Pok√©mon's global success and
retrospectively attributed this to its "Japanese cultural power",[546] while
ignoring the localization of Pok√©mon overseas,[547] as well as decades of
increasing cooperation and cultural exchange between countries (globalization).
[548]
In the 20th century, anime found niche popularity in North America and Europe
in series (Astro_Boy, Kimba_the_White_Lion, Speed_Racer) and films (Akira,
Ghost_in_the_Shell).[XIII] The Pok√©mon_TV_series and films marked a
breakthrough for anime, contributing to its growing worldwide success at the
turn of the 21st century.[XIV] For some children, Pok√©mon was their
introduction to 'Japanimation',[553][554] serving as a "gateway" to other
anime, manga, and Japanese culture in general.[555][556] Pok√©mon:_The_First
Movie became one of the most successful Japanese animated films in history.
[321] After Princess_Mononoke, Pok√©mon: The First Movie became the second anime
film to open at mainstream cinemas in the West, as opposed to the usual art
house venues.[557] Pioneering anime importer John_Ledford noted that Pok√©mon
underscored the commercial potential of anime, thus making it interesting from
a business perspective.[558]
In the field of video games, the main_Pok√©mon_series became the standard within
the monster-taming_game genre, a subtype of RPGs. While not the first to use
this concept, the Pok√©mon games became so synonymous with it that later titles
involving catching and training monsters, of any genre, were inevitably
compared to Pok√©mon.[559][560][561] Examples of this include Dragon_Warrior
Monsters (1998),[XV] Robopon_Sun_and_Star (1998),[567][568] Spectrobes (2007),
[XVI] Invizimals (2009),[XVII] Monster_Crown (2021),[XVIII] and Palworld
(2024).[XIX]
The success of Pok√©mon encouraged companies to look for other popular Japanese
properties that might be localized for Western markets.[250][589][590] The
importing of at least three similar franchises were confirmed by business
executives to have been (partly) inspired by Pok√©mon: Yu-Gi-Oh!,[591] Digimon,
[592] and Monster_Rancher.[593] The import of Cardcaptor_Sakura (as
Cardcaptors) might also have been prompted by Pok√©mon.[594][595]

   6. ^ a b Four[58] original card games are known to have been designed by
      Itoi: Slot Brothers,[59] Edoka,[60] Hanamaru,[61] and Rameka.[62] The
      1998 book The Secrets of Pokemon states that the last three games were
      contributed to by Ishihara.[63]
   7. ^ In Dragon_Quest_II, the item is called „Åµ„Åó„Åé„Å™„Åº„ÅÜ„Åó, Fushigina B≈çshi, i.e.
      Mysterious Hat. The Japanese Pokemon RPGs feature an item called „Åµ„Åó„Åé„Å™„Ç¢„É°,
      Fushigina Ame, i.e. Mysterious Candy. This item raises the level of a
      Pokemon by one. In the English games, it is called Rare Candy.
   8. ^ a b From the original Base_Set to the Neo_Destiny_sets, the booster
      packs contained 11 cards. After that and throughout the third_generation
      'EX'_sets, the booster packs contained 9 cards. From the fourth
      generation_Diamond_and_Pearl_sets onwards, the packs contained 10 cards.
      Since the seventh_generation_Sun_and_Moon_sets, the packs have again
      contained 11 cards.
   9. ^ A definitive number could not be established. The Fire_and_Disaster
      Management_Agency announced that, as of 17:00, December 17, a total of
      685 people had been taken to hospitals in direct relationship to the
      Pokemon episode. Of these, 208 people were actually hospitalized.[223]
      However, different figures have been stated by different sources.[224]
      [225] According to Hatakeyama & Kubo (2000), "approximately 750 children"
      were taken to hospitals, of which 135 were hospitalized.[226] It has been
      reported that, due to the incident catching the country off-guard,
      different methods of surveying were used throughout Japan, and these
      methods were not always accurate.[227]
  10. ^ However, Sailor_Moon did gain a cult following at the time.[263] After
      being pulled from syndication in spring 1996 due to low ratings,[264] it
      was broadcast again on USA_Network from June 1997 to March 1998.[265] The
      anime subsequently had a successful run on Cartoon_Network's Toonami
      block from June 1, 1998 to July 5, 2002, a timeframe that overlapped
      Pok√©mania.[263][265]
  11. ^ Shogakukan kept this condition until 2021. As of 2024[update], the last
      animated Pok√©mon feature is Pokemon: Coco („Éù„Ç±„É¢„É≥ „Ç≥„Ç≥), released in Japan on
      December 25, 2020. It was released worldwide (excluding Japan, Korea, and
      China) as Pok√©mon_the_Movie:_Secrets_of_the_Jungle on October 8, 2021.
      Between 1998 and 2021, a_total_of_23_anime_films were released.
  12. ^ In her 2006 book Millennial Monsters, Anne_Allison mentions the card
      suit and writes, within parentheses, that it "was eventually settled out
      of court".[495] However, she does not cite a source for this. The full
      sentence does contain an inline citation to a New_York_Times piece, but
      this article doesn't state that the case was settled.

               Anyone remember this show? I was surprised to discover this, it's been almost 15 years since this show has
[Guest Avatar] aired on disney and it gave me nostalgia vibes after watching a few episodes.

               What's sad is that the show is pretty much forgotten, there are only a few episodes on both vimeo and youtube,
               so some of it is already lost.

            Was looking for info about the Philippine episode when I found names of people involved with the show. From a Philstar.com_(a
            Philippine_news_site) article from 8 August 2004:¬†

            Walt Disney Television International-Asia Pacific (WDTVI-AP) received two World Gold PROMAX Awards for Disney‚Äôs Legends of the
            Ring of Fire, the first animated short story series produced by Walt Disney Television. Indonesia‚Äôs folktale Why the Sun
            Chases the Moon bagged the Gold in the category interstitial/promotainment ‚Äì Network or Block, executive produced by Raymund
            Miranda and Ashok Miranda. The other Gold was for Malaysia‚Äôs folktale The Chengal Tree, executive produced by Raymund Miranda,
            Shawn Letts, Kelvin Singh and Ashok Miranda.

            Legends of the Ring of Fire recounts stories from Asian folklore passed down from generation to generation. Combining high
            quality animation and memorable soundtracks with the magic of Disney‚Äôs unique storytelling style, the series captures the
            hearts and imagination of the young and old. It features classic folktales from India, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia,
            Korea, Thailand and the Philippines.

            WDTVI-AP‚Äôs creative services team headed by executive producer Natalie Gee also won a Silver PROMAX Award for Promotional
            Animation for the Studio D opener and a Silver BDA Design Award for Interstitial for Behind the Ears: Lilo & Stitch ‚Äì
            Something Stitch. Both were produced by Senior Graphics Producer Juddee Torres.

            "We are extremely pleased and honored to be presented with these awards," says Miranda, who is also the managing director.

            "These awards are a fitting validation of all the hard work and talent that go through the creation of each Disney program.
            We‚Äôre especially proud of Disney‚Äôs Legends of the Ring of Fire as we feel that it perfectly showcases Asia‚Äôs diverse, colorful
            and historic cultures and traditions," adds Miranda.

            I found another article on Miranda from_the_same_site¬†and his_LinkedIn_profile. He's an executive at ABS-CBN, which is facing
            challenging_times_right_now. Hence, maybe now is not the best time to contact him.

            ---

            I also found this forum post describing all episodes. It cites a now-deleted_forum_post_at_talkdisney.com. The post is
            availableat_the_Wayback_Machine, and cites The Jakarta Post ("By: Tantri Yuliandini August 22, 2003 Source: The Jakarta
            Post"). I cannot find The Jakarta Post article, but it is reproduced in jawawa.id, which I don't know anything about. If there
            are Indonesians here, please help. Hence, these descriptions remain unverified.

            In the beginning there were nine suns scorching the Earth. The Moon felt sorry for the people of Earth and helped them trick
            the father Sun into eating the other suns.



            This is the story of Why the Sun Chases the Moon, based on Indonesian folklore for the Disney Channel series Legends of the
            Ring of Fire.

phlmhunter  Long, long ago, it rained non-stop such that the earth was flooded. The white ants had to flee from their homes to escape the

[*][*][*]   a soft heart, agreed and struck a bargain with the white ants which lasts till this day.

            decided on a plan to bring back the nights and in doing so created the moon that we see in our skies to this day.



            - How Singapore Got Its Name, a tale from Singapore



            Premiere date: Saturday, Sept. 27



            Long, long ago there was a young adventurous king who loved to hunt. One day when he was in the jungle hunting for stags, he
            came a cross a beautiful island. Eager to explore it, he set sail immediately and encountered the fury of the Sea-King. Upon
            landing safely on the island, a majestic lion-like creature appeared from the jungle and gave the king the inspiration to name
            the island Singapore, which it is still known as to this day.



            - The Magic Snail, a tale from Korea



            Premiere date: Saturday, Oct. 11



            There once was a young, hardworking farmer who longed for a wife, and made a wish while working in his fields. He heard a
            reply come from a snail and took the snail home out of curiosity. The snail transformed into a beautiful lady, whom the farmer
            fell in love with and they were married. One day by chance, the king saw the beautiful snail-lady and wanted her for himself,
            so he challenged the farmer to a test. But with the help of his beautiful wife and the Dragon King, the farmer was able to
            overcome all obstacles and win back his wife.



            - How the Durian Came to Be, a tale from the Philippines



            Premiere date: Saturday, Oct. 25



            Long, long ago, a powerful king ruled the Kingdom of the Philippines, but he was sad as he had a beautiful young wife who did
            not love him. He decided to seek help from a wise hermit who told him how to win his wife's heart by planting a special tree.
            He succeeded with the help of the nymph of the air and held a celebration for the entire kingdom, but he forgot to invite the
            wise hermit. In a rage, the hermit cursed the tree and created the fruit we know as durian to this day.
            Based on these descriptions, there are still four¬†missing episodes: the tales from Malaysia, Singapore, Korea, and the
            Philippines.

            Meanwhile, among the found episodes are from Western Australia and Japan. This means that there are more than six episodes.
            Which means that I was correct when I said (see post above):

            According to the latter, six shorts were made. (I thought there were more.)

            The possibility of more episodes is not a Mandela effect. How many exactly were made I plan to ask Mr. Miranda when the time
            is right.

           I had never of heard of this show, but the few episodes that are availble seem great. Haven't located any other
           episodes but found some additional links/info.
Amdillae
Lost Media This forum_thread that has some assorted concept art (including a shot from The Magic Snail) as well as a link
Beginner   to a now dead and not waybacked page that stated the series had a total of 13 eps (so good calulation
[*]        phlmhunter).

[Amdillae  IMDB seeems to have a stub article for The_Herdsman_and_the_Weaver that does not associated it with the larger
Avatar]    series. Of the three names included only writer Polly Watkins has credits apart from the short.

Posts: 30  Another trail I have found that is already a dead end is the actor who voiced the narrator, Jim West, who
[Female]   passed away in 2009 (https://voiceactors.wordpress.com/tag/james-robert-west/ and voice123.com/jimwest)
           although strangely the first link mentions an Emmy for the voice over perfomance that I can't find any proof
           of. However it appears he also recieved a Promax award.

           The only two other major names I have come accross is the director of Why the Sun Chases the Moon and the
           series producer Atul_N_Rao. Another link for Rao mention that he wrote and directed for the series as well. A
           few other minor players, two animators and an audio enginer, include the show in their resumes/bios availble
           online

           Again not sure if any of this will help but just wanted to share what I have found. You know this series is
           obscure when googling¬†Disney "Legends of the Ring of Fire" only has 50 results with the ommited simlar results
           active.

League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer
online_battle_arena video game developed and published by Riot_Games. Inspired
by Defense_of_the_Ancients, a custom_map for Warcraft_III, Riot's founders
sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in
October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable
character customization. The game is available for Microsoft_Windows and macOS.
In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat,
each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten
players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and
differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by
collecting experience_points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the
opposing team. In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing
through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure
located within.
League of Legends has received generally positive reviews; critics have
highlighted its accessibility, character designs, and production value. The
game's long lifespan has resulted in a critical reappraisal, with reviews
trending positively; it is widely considered one of the greatest_video_games
ever_made. However, negative and abusive in-game player behavior, criticized
since the game's early days, persists despite Riot's attempts to fix the
problem. In 2019, League regularly peaked at eight million concurrent players,
and its popularity has led to tie-ins such as music, comic books, short
stories, and the animated series Arcane. Its success has spawned several spin-
off video games, including a mobile_version, a digital_collectible_card_game,
and a turn-based_role-playing_game, among others. A massively_multiplayer
online_role-playing_game based on the property is in development.
League of Legends is the world's largest esport, with an international
competitive_scene consisting of multiple regional leagues that culminate in an
annual League_of_Legends_World_Championship. The 2019_event registered over 100
million unique viewers, peaking at a concurrent viewership of 44 million during
the finals. Domestic and international events have been broadcast on
livestreaming websites such as Twitch, YouTube, Bilibili, and the cable
television sports channel ESPN.
***** Gameplay *****
[Screenshot_of_League_of_Legends,_featuring_four_champions_in_the_bottom_lane
of_the_game's_primary_map,_surrounded_by_minions.]Four champions in the bottom
lane of Summoner's Rift, surrounded by minions. The red health bars indicate
that they are opposing players.
League of Legends is a multiplayer_online_battle_arena (MOBA) game in which the
player controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique abilities from an
isometric perspective.[2][3] As of 2024,[update] there are 168 champions
available to play.[4] Over the course of a match, champions gain levels by
accruing experience_points (XP) through killing enemies.[5] Items can be
acquired to increase champions' strength,[6] and are bought with gold, which
players accrue passively over time and earn actively by defeating the opposing
team's minions,[2] champions, or defensive structures.[5][6] In the main game
mode, Summoner's Rift, items are purchased through a shop menu available to
players only when their champion is in the team's base.[2] Each match is
discrete; levels and items do not transfer from one match to another.[7]
**** Summoner's Rift ****
[The_game's_main_map._It_is_a_square,_with_the_team_bases_on_the_top_right_and
bottom_right_corners._There_are_three_pathways_to_each_base:_one_diagonally
across_the_centre,_and_the_others_going_up_and_turning_at_the_top_left_and
bottom_right_corners.]A simplified representation of Summoner's Rift. The
yellow paths are the "lanes" down which minions march; blue and red dots
represent turrets. The fountains are the dark areas within each base, and are
beside each Nexus. The dotted black line indicates the river.
Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of League of Legends and the most
prominent in professional-level_play.[8][9][10] The mode has a ranked
competitive ladder; a matchmaking system determines a player's skill level and
generates a starting rank from which they can climb. There are ten tiers; the
least skilled are Iron, Bronze, and Silver, and the highest are Master,
Grandmaster, and Challenger.[11][a]
Two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing team's "Nexus", which
is guarded by the enemy champions and defensive structures known as "turrets".
[14] Each team's Nexus is located in their base, where players start the game
and reappear after death.[14] Non-player_characters known as minions are
generated from each team's Nexus and advance towards the enemy base along three
lanes guarded by turrets: top, middle, and bottom.[15] Each team's base
contains three "inhibitors", one behind the third tower from the center of each
lane. Destroying one of the enemy team's inhibitors causes stronger allied
minions to spawn in that lane, and allows the attacking team to damage the
enemy Nexus and the two turrets guarding it.[16] The regions in between the
lanes are collectively known as the "jungle", which is inhabited by "monsters"
that, like minions, respawn at regular intervals. Like minions, monsters
provide gold and XP when killed.[17] Another, more powerful class of monster
resides within the river that separates each team's jungle.[18] These monsters
require multiple players to defeat and grant special abilities to their
slayers' team. For example, teams can gain a powerful allied unit after killing
the Rift Herald, permanent strength boosts by killing dragons, and stronger,
more durable minions by killing Baron Nashor.[19]
Summoner's Rift matches can last from as little as 15 minutes to over an hour.
[20] Although the game does not enforce where players may go, conventions have
arisen over the game's lifetime: typically one player goes in the top lane, one
in the middle lane, one in the jungle, and two in the bottom lane.[2][5][21]
Players in a lane kill minions to accumulate gold and XP (termed "farming") and
try to prevent their opponent from doing the same. A fifth champion, known as a
"jungler", farms the jungle monsters and, when powerful enough, assists their
teammates in a lane.[22]
**** Other modes ****
Besides Summoner's Rift, League of Legends has two other permanent game modes.
ARAM ("All Random, All Mid") is a five-versus-five mode like Summoner's Rift,
but on a map called Howling Abyss with only one long lane, no jungle area, and
with champions randomly chosen for players.[23][24][25] Given the small size of
the map, players must be vigilant in avoiding enemy abilities.[26]
Teamfight_Tactics is an auto_battler released in June 2019 and made a permanent
game mode the following month.[27][28] As with others in its genre, players
build a team and battle to be the last one standing. Players do not directly
affect combat but position their units on a board for them to fight
automatically against opponents each round.[29] Teamfight Tactics is available
for iOS and Android and has cross-platform_play with the Windows and macOS
clients.[30]
Other game modes have been made available temporarily, typically aligning with
in-game events.[31][32] Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) mode was available for two weeks
as a 2014 April_Fools_Day prank. In the mode, champion abilities have no
resource cost, significantly reduced cooldown timers, increased movement speed,
reduced healing, and faster attacks.[33][34] A year later, in April 2015, Riot
disclosed that they had not brought the mode back because its unbalanced design
resulted in player "burnout". The developer also said the costs associated with
maintaining and balancing URF were too high.[35] Other temporary modes include
One for All and Nexus Blitz. One for All has players pick a champion for all
members of their team to play.[36][37] In Nexus Blitz, players participate in a
series of mini-games on a compressed map.[38]
***** Development *****
**** Pre-release ****
[A_photograph_of_Riot_Games's_headquarters_in_West_Los_Angeles]Riot Games' West
Los Angeles headquarters
Riot Games' founders Brandon Beck and Marc Merill had an idea for a spiritual
successor to Defense_of_the_Ancients, known as DotA. A mod for Warcraft_III:
Reign_of_Chaos, DotA required players to buy Warcraft III and install custom
software; The_Washington_Post's Brian Crecente said the mod "lacked a level of
polish and was often hard to find and set up".[39] Phillip Kollar of Polygon
noted that Blizzard_Entertainment supported Warcraft III with an expansion
pack, then shifted their focus to other projects while the game still had
players. Beck and Merill sought to create a game that would be supported over a
significantly longer period.[40]
Beck and Merill held a DotA tournament for students at the University_of
Southern_California, with an ulterior goal of recruitment. There they met Jeff
Jew, later a producer on League of Legends. Jew was very familiar with DotA and
spent much of the tournament teaching others how to play. Beck and Merill
invited him to an interview, and he joined Riot Games as an intern.[39] Beck
and Merill recruited two figures involved with DotA: Steve Feak, one of its
designers,[39] and Steve Mescon, who ran a support website to assist players.
[41][42] Feak said early development was highly iterative, comparing it to
designing DotA.[43]
A demonstration of League of Legends built in the Warcraft III game engine was
completed in four months and then shown at the 2007 Game_Developers_Conference.
[40] There, Beck and Merill had little success with potential investors.
Publishers were confused by the game's free-to-play business model and lack of
a single-player mode. The free-to-play model was untested outside of Asian
markets,[39] so publishers were primarily interested in a retail release, and
the game's capacity for a sequel.[40] In 2008, Riot reached an agreement with
holding company Tencent to oversee the game's launch in China.[40]
League of Legends was announced October 7, 2008, for Microsoft_Windows.[44][45]
Closed_beta-testing began in April 2009.[44][46] Upon the launch of the beta,
seventeen champions were available.[47] Riot initially aimed to ship the game
with 20 champions but doubled the number before the game's full release in
North America on October 27, 2009.[48][49] The game's full name was announced
as League of Legends: Clash of Fates. Riot planned to use the subtitle to
signal when future content was available, but decided they were silly and
dropped it before launch.[40]
**** Post-release ****
League of Legends receives regular updates in the form of patches. Although
previous games had utilized patches to ensure no one strategy dominated, League
of Legends' patches made keeping pace with the developer's changes a core part
of the game. In 2014, Riot standardized their patch cadence to once
approximately every two or three weeks.[50]
The development team includes hundreds of game designers and artists. In 2016,
the music team had four full-time composers and a team of producers creating
audio for the game and its promotional materials.[51] As of 2021[update], the
game has over 150 champions,[52] and Riot Games periodically overhauls the
visuals and gameplay of the oldest in the roster.[53] Although only available
for Microsoft Windows at launch, a Mac version of the game was made available
in March 2013.[54]
In September 2024, Screen_Actors_Guild_for_radio_and_television placed League
of Legends on a list barring the union's members from working on the game. This
was to reprimand Formosa Interactive, a third-party audio provider used by
Riot, for using a shell company to subvert the 2024_SAG-AFTRA_video_game_strike
by employing non-union performers on a different game.[55] Formosa denied the
accusations in a statement, emphasising that it was unrelated to Riot.[56] In a
statement posted to X, Riot Games described League of Legends as a "union game"
since 2019 and said Formosa Interactive were directed to work only with union
actors in the US. Riot described any complaints related to other games as
unrelated to League of Legends.[57]
**** Revenue model ****
League of Legends uses a free-to-play business model. Several forms of purely
cosmetic customization‚Äîfor example, "skins" that change the appearance of
champions‚Äîcan be acquired after buying an in-game_currency called Riot Points
(RP).[58] Skins have five main pricing tiers, ranging from $4 to $25.[59] An
additional "luxury" tier was announced in 2024 that cannot be purchased
outright, but must be "won" using RP and an in-game slot_machine mechanic.[60]
As virtual goods, they have high profit_margins.[51] A loot_box system has
existed in the game since 2016; these are purchasable virtual "chests" with
randomized, cosmetic items.[61] These chests can be bought outright or acquired
at a slower rate for free by playing the game. The practice has been criticized
as a form of gambling.[62] In 2019, Riot Games' CEO said that he hoped loot
boxes would become less prevalent in the industry.[63] Riot has also
experimented with other forms of monetization. In August 2019, they announced
an achievement_system purchasable with Riot Points. The system was widely
criticized for its high cost and low value.[64]
In 2014, Ubisoft analyst Teut Weidemann said that only around 4% of players
paid for cosmetics‚Äîsignificantly lower than the industry standard of 15 to 25%.
He argued the game was only profitable because of its large player base.[65] In
2017, the game had a revenue of US$2.1¬†billion;[66] in 2018, a lower figure of
$1.4 billion still positioned it as one of the highest-grossing_games_of_2018.
[67] In 2019, the number rose to $1.5¬†billion, and again to $1.75¬†billion in
2020.[67][66] According to magazine Inc., players collectively played three
billion hours every month in 2016.[51]
**** Plot ****
See also: League_of_Legends_¬ß¬†Spin-offs_and_other_media
Before 2014, players existed in-universe as political leaders, or "Summoners",
commanding champions to fight on the Fields of Justice‚Äîfor example, Summoner's
Rift‚Äîto avert a catastrophic war.[68] Sociologist Matt Watson said the plot and
setting were bereft of the political themes found in other role-playing_games,
and presented in reductive "good versus evil" terms.[69] In the game's early
development, Riot did not hire writers, and designers wrote character
biographies only a paragraph long.[40]
In September 2014, Riot Games rebooted the game's fictional_setting, removing
summoners from the game's lore to avoid "creative stagnation".[68][70] Luke
Plunkett wrote for Kotaku that, although the change would upset long-term fans,
it was necessary as the game's player base grew in size.[71] Shortly after the
reboot, Riot hired Warhammer writer Graham_McNeill.[72] Riot's storytellers and
artists create flavor_text, adding "richness" to the game, but very little of
this is seen as a part of normal gameplay. Instead, that work supplies a
foundation for the franchise's expansion into other media,[51] such as comic
books and spin-off video games.[73][74] The Fields of Justice were replaced by
a new fictional setting‚Äîa planet called Runeterra. The setting has elements
from several genres‚Äîfrom Lovecraftian_horror to traditional sword_and_sorcery
fantasy.[75]

League of Legends received generally favorable reviews on its initial release,
according to review_aggregator website Metacritic.[76] Many publications noted
the game's high replay_value.[88][89][90] Kotaku reviewer Brian Crecente
admired how items altered champion play styles.[90] Quintin Smith of Eurogamer
concurred, praising the amount of experimentation offered by champions.[91]
Comparing it to Defense of the Ancients, Rick McCormick of GamesRadar+ said
that playing League of Legends was "a vote for choice over refinement".[92]
Given the game's origins, other reviewers frequently compared aspects of it to
DotA. According to GamesRadar+ and GameSpot, League of Legends would feel
familiar to those who had already played DotA.[79][93] The game's inventive
character design and lively colors distinguished the game from its competitors.
[85] Smith concluded his review by noting that, although there was not "much
room for negativity", Riot's goal of refining DotA had not yet been realized.
[91]
Although Crecente praised the game's free-to-play model,[90] GameSpy's Ryan
Scott was critical of the grind required for non-paying players to unlock key
gameplay elements, calling it unacceptable in a competitive game.[94][b] Many
outlets said the game was underdeveloped.[89][85] A physical version of the
game was available for purchase from retailers; GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd said it
was an inadvisable purchase because the value included $10 of store credit for
an unavailable store.[89] German site GameStar noted that none of the bonuses
in that version were available until the launch period had ended and refused to
carry out a full review.[96] IGN's Steve Butts compared the launch to the poor
state of CrimeCraft's release earlier in 2009; he indicated that features
available during League of Legends's beta were removed for the release, even
for those who purchased the retail version.[85] Matches took unnecessarily long
to find for players, with long queue_times,[90][85][97] and GameRevolution
mentioned frustrating bugs.[98]
Some reviewers addressed toxicity in the game's early history. Crecente wrote
that the community was "insular" and "whiney" when losing.[90] Butts speculated
that League of Legends inherited many of DotA's players, who had developed a
reputation for being "notoriously hostile" to newcomers.[85]
**** Reassessment ****

Regular updates to the game have resulted in a reappraisal by some outlets;
IGN's second reviewer, Leah B. Jackson, explained that the website's original
review had become "obsolete".[86] Two publications increased their original
scores: GameSpot from 6 to 9,[81][82] and IGN from 8 to 9.2.[85][86] The
variety offered by the champion roster was described by Steven Strom of PC
Gamer as "fascinating";[87] Jackson pointed to "memorable" characters and
abilities.[86] Although the items had originally been praised at release by
other outlets such as Kotaku,[90] Jackson's reassessment criticized the lack of
item diversity and viability, noting that the items recommended to the player
by the in-game shop were essentially required because of their strength.[86]
While reviewers were pleased with the diverse array of play styles offered by
champions and their abilities,[86][82][87] Strom thought that the female
characters still resembled those in "horny Clash_of_Clans clones" in 2018.[87]
Two years before Strom's review, a champion designer responded to criticism by
players that a young, female champion was not conventionally attractive. He
argued that limiting female champions to one body type was constraining, and
said progress had been made in Riot's recent releases.[99]
Comparisons persisted between the game and others in the genre. GameSpot's
Tyler Hicks wrote that new players would pick up League of Legends quicker than
DotA and that the removal of randomness-based skills made the game more
competitive.[82] Jackson described League of Legends' rate of unlock for
champions as "a model of generosity", but less than DotA's sequel, Dota_2
(2013), produced by Valve, wherein characters are unlocked by default.[86]
Strom said the game was fast-paced compared to Dota 2's "yawning" matches, but
slower than those of Blizzard Entertainment's "intentionally accessible" MOBA
Heroes_of_the_Storm (2015).[87]
**** Accolades ****
At the first Game_Developers_Choice_Awards in 2010, the game won four major
awards: Best Online Technology, Game Design, New Online Game, and Visual Arts.
[100] At the 2011 Golden_Joystick_Awards, it won Best Free-to-Play Game.[101]
Music produced for the game won a Shorty_Award,[102] and was nominated at the
Hollywood_Music_in_Media_Awards.[103]
League of Legends has received awards for its contribution to esports. It was
nominated for Best Esports Game at The_Game_Awards in 2017 and 2018,[104][105]
then won in 2019, 2020, and 2021.[106][107][108] Specific events organized by
Riot for esports tournaments have been recognized by awards ceremonies. Also at
The Game Awards, the Riot won Best Esports Event for the 2019, 2020 and 2021
League_World_Championships.[106][107][108] At the 39th Sports_Emmy_Awards in
2018, League of Legends won Outstanding Live Graphic Design for the 2017_world
championship; as part of the pre-competition proceedings, Riot used augmented
reality technology to have a computer-generated dragon fly across the stage.
[109][110][111]
***** Player behavior *****
League of Legends' player base has a longstanding reputation for
"toxicity"‚Äînegative and abusive in-game behavior,[112][113][114] with a survey
by the Anti-Defamation_League indicating that 76% of players have experienced
in-game harassment.[115] Riot Games has acknowledged the problem and responded
that only a small portion of the game's players are consistently toxic.
According to Jeffrey Lin, the lead designer of social systems at Riot Games,
the majority of negative behavior is committed by players "occasionally acting
out".[116] Several major systems have been implemented to tackle the issue. One
such measure is basic report functionality; players can report teammates or
opponents who violate the game's code of ethics. The in-game chat is also
monitored by algorithms that detect several types of abuse.[116] An early
system was the "Tribunal"‚Äîplayers who met certain requirements were able to
review reports sent to Riot. If enough players determined that the messages
were a violation, an automated system would punish them.[117] Lin said that
eliminating toxicity was an unrealistic goal, and the focus should be on
rewarding good player behavior.[118] To that effect, Riot reworked the "Honor
system" in 2017, allowing players to award teammates with virtual medals
following games, for one of three positive attributes. Acquiring these medals
increases a player's "Honor level", rewarding them with free loot boxes over
time.[119]
***** In esports *****
The 2016_League_of_Legends_World_Championship finals between SK_Telecom_T1 and
Samsung_Galaxy at the Staples_Center
Main article: League_of_Legends_in_esports
League of Legends is one of the world's largest esports, described by The_New
York_Times as its "main attraction".[120] Online viewership and in-person
attendance for the game's esports events outperformed those of the National
Basketball_Association, the World_Series, and the Stanley_Cup in 2016.[121] For
the 2019 and 2020 League of Legends World Championship finals, Riot Games
reported 44 and 45 peak million concurrent viewers respectively.[122][123]
Harvard_Business_Review said that League of Legends epitomized the birth of the
esports industry.[124]
As of April¬†2021[update], Riot Games operates 12 regional leagues
internationally,[125][126][127] four of which‚ÄîChina, Europe, Korea, and North
America‚Äîhave franchised_systems.[128][129][130][131][132] In 2017, this system
comprised 109 teams and 545 players.[133] League games are typically
livestreamed on platforms such as Twitch and YouTube.[123] The company sells
streaming rights to the game;[51] the North American league playoff is
broadcast on cable_television by sports network ESPN.[134] In China, the rights
to stream international events such as the World_Championships and the Mid-
Season_Invitational were sold to Bilibili in Fall 2020 for a three-year deal
reportedly worth US$113 million,[135][136][137] while exclusive streaming
rights for the domestic and other regional leagues are owned by Huya_Live.[138]
The game's highest-paid professional players have commanded salaries of above
$1 million‚Äîover three times the highest-paid players of Overwatch.[139] The
scene has attracted investment from businesspeople otherwise unassociated with
esports, such as retired basketball player Rick_Fox, who founded his_own_team.
[140] In 2020, his team's slot in the North American league was sold to the
Evil_Geniuses organization for $33 million.[141]
***** Spin-offs and other media *****

**** Games ****
For the 10th anniversary of League of Legends in 2019, Riot Games announced
several games at various stages of production that were directly related to the
League of Legends intellectual_property (IP).[142][143] A stand-alone version
of Teamfight Tactics was announced for mobile operating systems iOS and Android
at the event and released in March 2020. The game has cross-platform play with
the Windows and macOS clients.[30] Legends of Runeterra, a free-to-play digital
collectible_card_game, launched in April 2020 for Microsoft Windows; the game
features characters from League of Legends.[144][145][146] League_of_Legends:
Wild_Rift is a version of the game for mobile operating systems Android and
iOS.[147] Instead of porting the game from League of Legends, Wild Rift's
character models and environments were entirely rebuilt.[148] A single-player,
turn-based_role-playing_game, Ruined_King:_A_League_of_Legends_Story, was
released in 2021 for PlayStation_4, PlayStation_5, Xbox_One, Xbox_Series_X/S,
Nintendo_Switch, and Windows.[74] It was the first title released under Riot
Games' publishing arm, Riot_Forge, wherein non-Riot studios develop games using
League of Legends characters.[149] In December 2020, Greg Street, vice-
president of IP and Entertainment at Riot Games, announced that a massively
multiplayer_online_role-playing_game based on the game is in development.[150]
Song_of_Nunu:_A_League_of_Legends_Story, a third-person adventure game
revolving around the champion Nunu's search for his mother, with the help of
the yeti Willump, was announced for a planned release in 2022. It is being
developed by Tequila_Works, the creators of Rime.[151] It was released on
Windows and the Nintendo Switch on November 1, 2023.[152]
**** Music ****
Riot Games' first venture into music was in 2014 with the virtual heavy_metal
band Pentakill, promoting a skin line of the same name.[153][154] Initially,
Pentakill consisted of six champions: Kayle, Karthus, Mordekaiser, Olaf, Sona,
and Yorick. In 2021, Viego was introduced to the group. Their music was
primarily made by Riot Games' in-house music team but featured cameos by M√∂tley
Cr√ºe drummer Tommy_Lee and Danny_Lohner, a former member of industrial rock
band Nine_Inch_Nails. Their second album, Grasp of the Undying, reached number
one on the iTunes metal charts in 2017.[154]
Pentakill was followed by K/DA, a virtual K-pop girl_group composed of four
champions, Ahri, Akali, Evelynn, and Kai'sa. As with Pentakill, K/DA is
promotional material for a skin line by the same name.[155] The group's debut
single, "Pop/Stars", which premiered at the 2018_League_of_Legends_World
Championship, garnered over 400 million views on YouTube and sparked widespread
interest from people unfamiliar with League of Legends.[156] After a two-year
hiatus, in August 2020, Riot Games released "The_Baddest", the pre-release
single for All_Out, the five-track debut EP from K/DA which followed in
November that year.[157]
In 2019, Riot created a virtual hip_hop group called True Damage,[158]
featuring the champions Akali, Yasuo, Qiyana, Senna, and Ekko.[159] The
vocalists‚ÄîKeke_Palmer, Thutmose, Becky_G, Duckwrth, and Soyeon‚Äîperformed a live
version of the group's debut song, "Giants", during the opening ceremony of the
2019_League_of_Legends_World_Championship, alongside holographic versions of
their characters.[159] The in-game cosmetics promoted by the music video
featured a collaboration with fashion house Louis_Vuitton.[160]
In 2023, Riot formed Heartsteel, a virtual boy_band, comprising the champions
Aphelios, Ezreal, Kayn, K'Sante, Sett, and Yone. The vocalists are Baekhyun
from the K-pop groups Exo and SuperM, Cal Scruby, √òZI, and Tobi_Lou.
Heartsteel's debut single "Paranoia" was released in October of that year.[161]
**** Comics ****
Riot announced a collaboration with Marvel_Comics in 2018.[73] Riot had
previously experimented with releasing comics through its website.[162][163]
Shannon Liao of The_Verge noted that the comic books were "a rare opportunity
for Riot to showcase its years of lore that has often appeared as an
afterthought".[73] The first comic was League of Legends: Ashe‚ÄîWarmother, which
debuted in 2018, followed by League of Legends: Lux that same year.[164] A
print version of the latter was released in 2019.[165]
**** Animated series ****
In a video posted to celebrate the tenth anniversary of League of Legends, Riot
announced an animated television series, Arcane,[166] the company's first
production for television.[167] Arcane was a collaborative effort between Riot
Games and animation studio Fortiche_Production.[167] In an interview with The
Hollywood_Reporter, head of creative development Greg_Street said the series is
"not a light-hearted show. There are some serious themes that we explore there,
so we wouldn't want kids tuning in and expecting something that it's not."[166]
The series is set in the utopian city of Piltover and its underground,
oppressed sister city, Zaun.[167][168][169] It stars Hailee_Steinfeld as Vi,
Ella_Purnell as Jinx, Kevin_Alejandro as Jayce, and Katie_Leung as Caitlyn.
[170] The series was set to be released in 2020 but was delayed by the COVID-19
pandemic.[171] On November 6, 2021, Arcane premiered its first season on
Netflix following the 2021_League_of_Legends_World_Championship,[172] and was
available through Tencent_Video in China.[167] It received critical acclaim
upon release, with IGN's Rafael Motomayor asking rhetorically if the series
marked the end of the "video game adaptation curse".[173] A second and final
season was released in November 2024 to a similarly positive critical response.
[174][175]

      limited its comic book ambitions to panels published on its site, which
      are timed to certain champion updates or cosmetic skin releases. Notably,
      a comic featuring Miss Fortune, a deadly pirate bounty hunter and captain
      of her own ship who seeks revenge on the men who betrayed her, was
      released last September.

Thomas Jefferson, President 1801-1809
****** Fun Facts About Thomas Jefferson ******
Born on April 13, 1743, Thomas Jefferson was a leading figure in our country‚Äôs
quest for independence. A native of Virginia, Jefferson also played important
roles in the early history of our fledgling nation as its Minister to France,
Secretary of State and third President.
A true Renaissance man, Jefferson is known for his many talents in writing,
economics, religion and philosophy as well as horticulture and mathematics. He
spoke 6 languages including English, French, Greek, Italian, Latin and Spanish.
He also had a love for the written word, having written over 19,000 letters in
his lifetime.
**** A Multi-Talented Thinker ****
Jefferson was an inventor, lawyer and educator. He graduated from the
University of William and Mary at the age of 18, two years after he enrolled in
1762. He was the designer of Monticello, the Virginia State Capital and The
Rotunda at the University of Virginia among other notable buildings. His
influential style has become known as ‚ÄúJeffersonian Architecture‚Äù. Monticello
and The Rotunda are both World Heritage Sites.
**** He Went on a Hunger Strike (and Encouraged Others to Join Him) ****
As a member of Virginia‚Äôs House of Burgesses, Jefferson called for a day of
prayer and fasting in support of the citizens of Boston when the British
government closed the harbor in response to the Boston_Tea_Party. As he had
hoped, this action allied Virginia with the_Patriots‚Äô_cause_in_Massachusetts
and_fueled_opposition_to_the_Intolerable_Acts.
**** He Was the Major Pen of the Declaration of Independence ****
At the age of 33, Thomas_Jefferson was one of the youngest delegates to the
Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia. He became acquainted with John
Adams, a leader of the Congress, and through this budding friendship, Jefferson
was appointed to the Committee of Five that was tasked with drafting the
Declaration of Independence. Over the next 17 days, he would create the first
draft. Jefferson is considered by many to be the primary author of the document
because the committee left intact more than 75 percent of his original draft.
Many believed that John Adams would be the primary author of this important
document, but he had persuaded the Committee to choose Jefferson instead. The
preamble is regarded as one of the most enduring statements of human rights and
the phrase ‚Äúall men are created equal‚Äù is considered one of the most well-known
expressions in the English language. Jefferson was an eloquent writer, but did
not fancy himself a public speaker, and chose to show his support of the
Patriot cause through written correspondence.
**** Writing to Justify the Actions of Discontent Bostonians ****
In 1774, Jefferson penned a pamphlet entitled ‚ÄúA Summary View of the Rights of
British Americans‚Äù. In the pamphlet, he outlined a set of grievances that the
colonies had against King_George_III. Jefferson also wrote that ‚Äúan exasperated
people‚Äù who felt oppression, when given the chance, would act out in defiance.
The perfect example of this defiance was the ‚Äúdestruction of the tea‚Äù, or what
would become known as the Boston Tea Party. Like his colleagues George
Washington and¬†Benjamin_Franklin,¬†Jefferson believed the act was destruction of
private property subject to local laws, but his pamphlet outlined why it was
justified as an act of political protest.
**** His Proudest Moments ****
Jefferson‚Äôs grave is inscribed with an epitaph of the three things of which he
was the proudest. They are his authorship of the Declaration of Independence,
the Statute of Virginia that guaranteed religious freedom and his founding of
the University of Virginia in 1819. There is no mention of him being President
on his gravestone.
**** A Family Man ****
Jefferson married Martha Wayles Skelton, a widow, in 1772. He fathered six
children, though only two daughters survived to adulthood. Throughout his life,
Jefferson had twelve grandchildren; several of them having lived with him at
Monticello. Jefferson loved to play with his grandchildren, teaching them how
to play chess and a game called Goose. (Goose was one of the first board games
in the United States, rather similar to our modern version of Chutes and
Ladders.) After his wife died, historians believe he began a relationship with
Sally Hemings, one of his slaves. After his death, Jefferson‚Äôs daughter allowed
Hemings to live as a free woman in Charlottesville until she died in 1835. DNA
tests in 2000 show a familial gene common between their descendants.
**** A Controversial Start to His Presidency ****
It was only after the chaotic election of 1800 between Jefferson and¬†John
Adams¬†that Congress decided to ratify the 12th Amendment to the Constitution.
The debacle occurred when Jefferson received the same number of electoral votes
as his running mate Aaron Burr and Burr refused to concede the election. The
House of Representatives decided the election after 36 ballots on February 17,
1801. They chose Jefferson as President and Burr as Vice President.
**** Landmark Acquisition ****
Early in his presidency, Jefferson was able to achieve one of the greatest
acquisitions of his political career with the Louisiana Purchase, which more
than doubled the size of the United States. The 529,000,000-acre tract of land
is one of the most fertile on Earth and eliminated the nation‚Äôs reliance on
other countries for its food. Jefferson did not believe the Constitution gave
him the power to make the $15 million land acquisition, but agreed with
Congress to make the purchase. He appointed Meriwether Lewis and William Clark
to lead an expedition known as the Corps of Discovery to explore the newly
acquired territory. Sacagawea, who both men acknowledged as providing an
indispensable service, accompanied them on the journey.
**** Lifelong Connection ****
After meeting at the Second Continental Congress in 1775, Thomas Jefferson and
John Adams became lifelong friends. Their relationship deepened through years
of letter-writing, including letters written between Abigail Adams and
Jefferson. They spent years in France together as Jefferson and Adams served as
trade ministers in Europe. The two remained close friends despite their
political differences; that is, until Jefferson beat Adams in the Election of
1801 to become President of the United States. They resumed their close
friendship after about 10 years of separation. Both Thomas Jefferson and John
Adams died on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of
Independence. Legend holds that Adams‚Äô last words were¬†‚ÄúThomas_Jefferson
survives.‚Äù Unbeknownst to Adams, Jefferson had died a few hours earlier. They
were the last surviving members of the original group of Patriots that became
known as America‚Äôs Founding Fathers. Jefferson and Adams also share the
distinction of being the only Declaration of Independence signatories who would
later serve as President.
**** He Lives On ****
In addition to the Jefferson Memorial near the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C.,
he is immortalized on the $2 bill, the nickel and as one of the figures of
Mount Rushmore. The memorial in the nation‚Äôs capital, featuring a 19-foot tall
statue of Jefferson, was dedicated in 1943 on the 200th anniversary of his
birth.

[Bob Woodward, right, and Carl Bernstein in the Washington Post newsroom, 7 May
1973]

Woodward (right) and Bernstein (left) became the embodiment of the media myth
about Watergate
By Prof W Joseph Campbell
American University, Washington DC
The run-up to the 40th anniversary of the Watergate break-in ‚Äî the burglary
that gave rise to America&#x27;s gravest political crisis ‚Äî has inevitably been
accompanied by the mythology that has shaped and distorted popular
understanding of the epic scandal.
The mythology is both delicious and durable, and revolves around the Washington
Post and its Watergate reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. They are
legends in American journalism, not only because of their award-winning
reporting but because of the screen adaptation of their book about Watergate,
All the President&#x27;s Men.
The movie came out in 1976 and starred Robert Redford as Woodward, and Dustin
Hoffman as Bernstein. The New York Times called it "a spellbinding detective
story". And the Post once described All the President&#x27;s Men as "the best
film ever made about the craft of journalism".
It is undoubtedly the most-viewed of the handful of films and documentaries
about Watergate, the scandal that toppled President Richard Nixon and sent to
jail 20 men associated with his administration or his 1972 re-election
campaign.
All the President&#x27;s Men was more than merely entertaining. It was a
vehicle for propelling and solidifying prominent media myths of Watergate, five
of which are discussed here:
<bold>The Washington Post brought down Nixon&#x27;s corrupt presidency</bold>:
This long ago became the dominant narrative of the Watergate scandal. It holds
that Woodward and Bernstein, through their dogged reporting, revealed the
crimes that forced Nixon to resign the presidency in August 1974.
That&#x27;s also the inescapable, if tacit conclusion of the movie, which
places Woodward and Bernstein at the centre of Watergate&#x27;s unravelling
while minimising or ignoring the far more decisive contributions of subpoena-
wielding investigators.
Rolling up a scandal of Watergate&#x27;s dimension and complexity required the
collective efforts of special prosecutors, federal judges, both houses of
Congress, the Supreme Court, as well as the Justice Department and the FBI.
Even then, Nixon likely would have survived the scandal if not for the
audiotape recordings he secretly made of conversations in the Oval Office of
the White House. Only when compelled by the Supreme Court did Nixon surrender
the recordings, which captured him approving a plan to divert the FBI&#x27;s
investigation of the break-in.
Interestingly, principals at the Washington Post have periodically scoffed at
the dominant narrative of Watergate. Woodward, for example, once said "the
mythologising of our role in Watergate has gone to the point of absurdity,
where journalists write‚Ä¶ that I, single-handedly, brought down Richard Nixon.
Totally absurd".
<bold>The Post, at least, "uncovered" the Watergate story</bold>: Not quite.
Watergate began as a police beat story. News of the scandal&#x27;s seminal
crime ‚Äî the thwarted break-in of 17 June 1972, at the headquarters of the
Democratic National Committee at the Watergate complex in Washington DC ‚Äî began
circulating within hours.
The opening paragraph of the Post&#x27;s front-page report about the burglary
made clear that the details had come from investigators. It read: "Five men,
one of whom said he is a former employee of the Central Intelligence Agency,
were arrested at 2:30 a.m. yesterday in what authorities described as an
elaborate plot to bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee here."
Nor did the Post uncover crucial elements of the deepening scandal, such as
Nixon&#x27;s secret taping system. Existence of the White House tapes was
disclosed in 1973 to an investigating committee of the US Senate.
And as Edward Jay Epstein pointed out in a brilliant essay in 1974, the
Watergate reporting of Woodward and Bernstein was often derivative and
sustained by leaks from federal investigations into the scandal.
<bold>The stealthy Watergate source Deep Throat famously advised Woodward to
"follow the money</bold>": That pithy and often-quoted line supposedly was the
key to unlocking the complexities of Watergate. In fact, it was born of
dramatic licence.
[W Mark Felt speaks to reporters in 2005]
Image caption,
In 2005, W Mark Felt, a justice department official, confessed that he was Deep
Throat
"Follow the money" was spoken not by the real-life Deep Throat source but by
Hal Holbrook, the actor who played Deep Throat in All the President&#x27;s Men.
In real-life, the Deep Throat source conferred periodically with Woodward
(sometimes in an underground car park) as the scandal unfolded. But he did not
advise Woodward to "follow the money".
Woodward and Bernstein were already on the money trail: One of their most
important stories was to describe how funds donated to Nixon&#x27;s re-election
campaign had been used for the Watergate break-in. But unravelling the scandal
was far more demanding than following the money. Nixon resigned not because he
misused funds donated to his 1972 campaign but because he clearly obstructed
justice.
Deep Throat, by the way, revealed himself in 2005 to have been W Mark Felt,
formerly the FBI&#x27;s second-ranking official. He was no hero, though.
Felt was convicted in 1980 on felony charges related to break-ins he had
approved in the FBI&#x27;s investigations into the radical Weather Underground
organisation. But Felt never went to jail. He was pardoned in 1981 by President
Ronald Reagan.
<bold>Their Watergate reporting placed Woodward and Bernstein in grave danger</
bold>: Hardly, although All the President&#x27;s Men says as much. In a scene
near the close of the movie, Deep Throat tells Woodward that the
reporters&#x27; "lives are in danger".
The warning, which injected drama into the movie&#x27;s sometimes-leaden
pacing, also was mentioned in All the President&#x27;s Men, the book. However,
it was fairly quickly determined to have been a false alarm.

Robert Redford: &#x27;I came in when journalism had reached an apex of morality
and professionalism&#x27;
Woodward, Bernstein and senior editors at the Post took precautions for a while
to avoid the suspected electronic surveillance of their activities. But as
Woodward recounted in The Secret Man, his 2005 book about Deep Throat, such
measures "soon seemed melodramatic and unnecessary. We never found any evidence
that our phones were tapped or that anyone&#x27;s life was in danger".
On another occasion, Woodward said the "most sinister pressure" he and
Bernstein felt during Watergate "was the repeated denial" by Nixon&#x27;s White
House "of the information we were publishing" as the scandal deepened.
<bold>University enrolments in journalism courses soared because of Watergate</
bold>: It&#x27;s an appealing subsidiary myth, that the Watergate exploits of
Woodward and Bernstein, as dramatised by Redford and Hoffman, made journalism
seem glamorous and alluring. So alluring that young Americans in the 1970s
supposedly thronged to enrol on journalism courses.
It&#x27;s a myth that endures despite its thorough repudiation by scholarly
research. One such study, financed by the Freedom Forum media foundation,
reported in 1995 that "growth in journalism education" resulted "not from such
specific events as Watergate‚Ä¶ but rather to a larger extent from the appeal of
the field to women, who have been attending universities in record numbers".
The study was unequivocal in stating that "students didn&#x27;t come rushing to
the university because they wanted to follow in the footsteps of Woodward and
Bernstein ‚Äî or Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, for that matter".
A similar study, released in 1988, declared: "It is frequently, and wrongly,
asserted that the investigative reporting of Woodward and Bernstein provided
popular role models for students, and led to a boom in journalism school
enrolments."
Instead that study found that enrolments already had doubled between 1967 and
1972, the year of the Watergate break-in.

****** Rural legends. Examples? ******
Ralph Maughan
August_26,_2008
It was suggested in another thread that it would be interesting, informative
and useful to come up with a list and/or discuss what JB has called ‚Äúrural
legends.‚Äù These would be similar to the well known term ‚Äúurban legends,‚Äù but
they would be much more common in rural areas and deal with the outdoors ‚Äî
wildlife, hunting and fishing, farming, grazing, politics related to these
things.
So let‚Äôs see if we can discover some.
Already a number or people have described the belief that the state wildlife
department or the federal government is dropping, transplanting, turning loose,
various kinds of undesirable animals in rural areas.
I first heard this rumor in Idaho in the early 1980s when there was the
persistent rumor that Idaho Fish and Game was turning loose ‚Äúbad‚Äù grizzly bears
from Yellowstone Park onto Coolwater Ridge, which is a tall and broad ridge
between the Selway and Lochsa Rivers in north central Idaho ‚Äî hundreds of miles
from Yellowstone Park.
‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì
‚Äì more(important)‚Äì A rural legend would be a sub-class of urban legends
according the the Wikipedia article on urban legends. ‚ÄúDespite its name, a
typical urban legend does not necessarily originate in an urban setting. The
term is simply used to differentiate modern legend from traditional folklore in
preindustrial times. For this reason, sociologists and folklorists prefer the
term \‚Äô‚Äùcontemporary legend.‚Äô ‚Äù
Urban and rural legends are not the same as myths, but they are related. Once
again, from the Wikipedia,
The earliest term by which these narratives were known, ‚Äúurban belief tales,‚Äù
highlights what was then thought to be a key property: they were held, by their
tellers, to be true accounts, and the device of the FOAF was a spurious but
significant effort at authentication. The coinage leads in turn to the terms
‚ÄúFOAFlore‚Äù and ‚ÄúFOAFtale‚Äù. While at least one classic legend ‚Äì the ‚ÄúDeath Car‚Äù
‚Äî has been shown to have some basis in fact, folklorists as such are interested
in debunking these narratives only to the degree that establishing non-
factuality warrants the assumption that there must be some other reason why the
tales are told and believed. As in the case of myth, these narratives are
believed because they construct and reinforce the of the group within which
they are told, or ‚Äúbecause they provide us with coherent and convincing
explanations of complex events‚Äù For this reason, it is characteristic of groups
within which a given narrative circulates to react very negatively to claims or
demonstrations of non-factuality; an example would be the expressions of
outrage by police officers who are told that adulteration of Halloween treats
by strangers is extremely rare, if it has occurred at all, or the vehement
responses.

      Where to begin???? Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶
      Fish & Wildlife brought in coyotes to kill off the deer. (Huh? When coys
      started popping up in KY, there weren‚Äôt that many deer! The deer
      population has just exploded in the last 20 or so years.)
      The reintroduced elk all have that mad cow disease. (Uh no‚Ä¶ or at least
      to the best of the state veterinarian‚Äôs knowledge, none of them were
      carrying CWD. There have been a few cases of some type of a ‚Äúbrain worm‚Äù
      but no CWD ‚Äì thank God!)
      They brought in bears and mountain lions to kill off the diseased elk.
      (See previous statement & hate to tell ‚Äôem but there were lions & bears
      in the mountains of Eastern KY loooong before the elk introduction took
      place ‚Äì no matter what the powers-that-be might think!)
      And, my favorite, Fish & Wildlife released rattlesnakes in the mountains
      to try to keep out hunters. (Nope ‚Äì they‚Äôve been there forever too. But
      I‚Äôve heard that a lot of the ‚Äúgood ol‚Äô boys‚Äù used to release rattlesnakes
      around their pot fields to keep people from looking too closely. That
      one‚Äôs most likely true!)

      Oh and I forgot this one‚Ä¶ When the state deer population was hit by a
      gnat-borne hemorrhagic syndrome last year (similar to blue tongue but
      different), I can‚Äôt tell you how many people I tried (mostly
      unsuccessfully) to explain to that it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúmad cow disease‚Äù ‚Äì that it
      was something totally different! The usual response was ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs
      what they want you to think!‚Äù Ahhh‚Ä¶ conspiracy theorizing at it‚Äôs finest!

      LOL . . Ralph that is a good one. . I hope it was true! The legends I
      have heard from around here are the same ones you always hear everywhere
      I guess. Last week I went out to one of my favorite spots in Washington
      and ran into a road crew that was fixing the road I wanted to go down. It
      was late in the afternoon and the work had stopped but the security guard
      and his family were staying the night there to watch the equipment. I
      talked with him about a slide area you couldn‚Äôt drive around which they
      had fixed. . . and then he mentioned that he and his family had seen a
      huge black bear, about 350lbs, and that there were a couple of rigs of
      bear hunters chasing him right then and that the big bear was running
      around right where I wanted to ride my bike. So we launched into a talk
      about bears and he told me after he realized I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúascared‚Äù of black
      bears that now grizzlies . . . that‚Äôs another thing, we might have some
      of those around and they are monsters . . they will come right in on ya.
      I wanted to get on to what I came to do so I cut him short on that with
      the fact that I spent a lot of time with them in Alaska and as a matter
      of fact had written a book on them. I suspect that had I been a little
      less knowledgeable about bears I would have turned around and gone home.
      . which actually I did after I tracked the bear hunters for a while and
      realized that 1. the bear got away and 2. that they were frustrated and
      on the ridge above me. I am way more ‚Äúascared‚Äù of a rifle than a bear.

      Here‚Äôs a well worn one: ‚ÄúWolves are putting people are going out of
      business.‚Äù I challenge anyone to provide even a single example where any
      rancher or outfitter was even arguably (let alone definitively) ‚Äúput out
      of business‚Äù because of wolf depredation.

      Hal mentioned on the previous post the myth of the great ‚ÄúCanadian Wolf,‚Äù
      which is some mutant monster that averages 200 lbs and consumes
      everything in its path.
      A couple of other wolf myths:
      (1) wolves have never killed or attacked anyone in North America. In
      fact, wolf attacks in Alaska and Canada have been documented by McNay
      (here‚Äôs the report version: http://www.wildlife.alaska.gov/pubs/techpubs/
      research_pdfs/techb13_full.pdf)
      (2) Wolves are ‚Äúdecimating‚Äù elk populations across the West. This one has
      been thoroughly scrutinized in previous posts.
      There are so many, I‚Äôll bow out and let others have some fun.

      The reintroduction of wolves was designed to drive the Western livestock
      industry out of business.

      August_26,_2008
      And‚Ä¶
      The wolves were also reintroduced to kill all the elk so that they could
      close down hunting and ATVing in the woods in order to drive EVERYBODY
      OUT OF THE WOODS.
      And then, you know, the moose around Yellowstone are decimated by the
      wolves AND that they, get this ~in fifteen years‚Äô time~ have evolved.
      Now this gets interesting because there are TWO evolution stories here,
      depending on which ‚Äúthey‚Äù you‚Äôre going for here;
      a) the moose have evolved in such a way as to have different antlers that
      are now capable of scewering two wolves in one swing of their head‚Ä¶
      b) the wolves that were reintroduced to Yellowstone in 1995 were NOT the
      first reintroduction attempt this last century. They were actually
      reintroduced in the late 1980‚Äôs from someplace in northern Minnesota and
      let out somewhere near Gardiner and that they were some vicious strain of
      ‚Äúpowerwolf‚Äù but the ones from the 1995 reintroduction were smaller and
      tamer and they have now interbred and ‚Äúevolved‚Äù into a more tolerable
      ‚Äústrain‚Äù of wolf. Though they have still over populated and have eaten
      all the available elk to date.
      Then, did you know that wolves have several litters of pups a year, as in
      several times a year like cats can.?
      They never told me about these things in genetics class!! And I didn‚Äôt
      miss a lecture!

      ‚ÄúNo sound attracts wolves more than the sound of a laughing or crying

      Here‚Äôs one I heard at the gas station a few weeks ago‚Ä¶The government
      wants to list Polar Bears in order to end hunting. There are actually
      lots of polar bears in the Arctic, but the government changes the numbers
      to say they are endangered just to stop all bear hunting and promote the
      environmentalist global warming agenda.

      Hal and JB nailed it.
      The legend of the introduced, insatiable, omnipotent ‚ÄúCanadian Wolf‚Äù has
      to be one of the greatest tales ever told. The gist being that somehow
      the feds introduced a version of wolf that was never here to begin with
      and outcompeted the version of the wolf ‚Äúthat was already here‚Äù in 1995.
      This alternate strain of wolf kills everything, is huge, and wholly
      fearless of humans. Oh, and it has no morals, unlke its smaller, kind-
      hearted and apparently herbivorian brother that was here originally.
      I guess my question is this ‚Äì do people really think wolves recognize, or
      have ever recognized, international borders?
      If you believe this legend then you believe that wolves in Idaho did not
      historically intermingle with wolves in Canada. Ever.
      But, alas, logic does not rule the day and I am merely laughed at by the
      fiends in their Spire of Mockery!

      ‚Äúwolves are the cause of the decline in the grouse population.‚Äù
      And I thought for sure they‚Äôd blame that one on coyotes! I suppose wolves
      are probably to blame for dying sagebrush as well?

      The BLM would have you believe that junipers are the reason for the
      decline of sage grouse populations. I guess that‚Äôs not just a rural myth
      but a government sanctioned myth.

      Changing the subject from wolves, there is legend that the grazing of the
      rangelands has been neatly (effectively) replaced by grazing them with
      cattle.

      Layton,
      Yes, that would be a myth but to say that wolves primarily kill the old,
      the sick, and the crippled would be accurate. I think that is what most
      educated people say and I would be quick to correct anyone who used the
      word ‚Äúonly‚Äù in that regard.

      I can certainly attest that there is no end to the myths concerning
      wolves and the detriment they are to everything in this here god‚Äôs world.
      (Based on the earful I get on occasion from some of my favorite
      storytellers!)
      The one about wolves being overpopulated now is widespread, I hear it
      from tourists from other areas of the country. They know next to nothing,
      a great number of the folks I encounter at least, the media doesn‚Äôt cover
      it much, and certainly doesn‚Äôt care to include too much content when they
      do cover wolf issues.

      Myths I‚Äôve heard:
      Entire herds and flocks being obliterated in one night.
      The wolf‚Äôs utter incapacity to control their own number without human
      management.
      Wolves and coyotes interbreeding = super hyper killer mutant wolf
      gumbercules!
      An insatiable longing to stalk and kill children, not to mention any
      other small human owned critter (no offence intended parents).
      The act of making carcass ‚Äòwards‚Äô to scare other wolves off a ranch
      (unfortunately only humans react to such things). Personally I think its
      just showing off ‚Äì could be mistaken.
      Wolves when hunting:
      ‚Äì Tearing foetuses out of a living mother ungulate
      ‚Äì Eating their prey alive* (*sometimes but not a frequent occurrence)
      ‚Äì Being cruel when killing and thoroughly enjoying the act
      Then again we‚Äôve also got the guys who accept the wolf as a predator‚Ä¶ aka
      something that needs to be shot on sight because it spoils ‚Äòhappy time‚Äô.

      wait, we forgot the one where wolves were reintroduced by vegatarians so
      thatthey could kill the cows off‚Ä¶
      and woves were an environmentalist scheme to kill all the cattle on
      public lands‚Ä¶.
      the pine beetle problem is a result of the government trying to use them
      to control weeds‚Ä¶
      wolves would have died out in the Rockies even if they hadn‚Äôt been hunted
      to extinction there‚Ä¶.
      wolves kill every animal they come across and leave them there to rot‚Ä¶.
      all hunters want to keep elk feeding grounds so they can shoot bigger
      bulls and get more cow tags‚Ä¶
      every rancher is a wolf hater‚Ä¶.
      women who are menstrating attract wolves‚Ä¶
      coyotes and wolves mate constantly, like rabbits,‚Ä¶

      I really don‚Äôt know why you think that the only useful animal to a hunter
      is one that he can kill. Most true sportsmen enjoy all the critters and
      yes even the wolves at times. As far as bigfoot tags go, I really don‚Äôt
      feel there numbers are great enough yet for a season and personally I
      hope no matter how many there are they won‚Äôt open a season. I would
      however like to train one to pack out my elk. I actually own an atv but I
      don‚Äôt hunt from it and with me getting older I can‚Äôt pack as well as I
      used to. I‚Äôve been told though that the bigfoot is really fond of jerky
      and with the right jerky you can get them to do almost anything. I‚Äôve
      never tried b-bq rats or bigfoot, but with enough catsup you can make
      anything taste better, probably even a wolf.

      cobra: Little bit out of this topic here, nevertheless:
      I have no problem at all with hunting in general ‚Äì hunting for food
      (delicious!) to be precise. This however does not include what in Africa
      is called, ‚Äúhunting bushmeat‚Äù ‚Äì animals that are not really edible). I
      have however a problem with huting in so far as over the centuries
      countless species have been driven into extinction or to near extinction
      by over-hunting. I have a severe problem with ego hunting. With the
      ‚Äúsportsmen‚Äù (a term left over from the glory days of hunting in the
      commonwealth I think) putting the lights out of a bear, a tiger, a lion,
      a buffalo, a coyote, an elk, a wolf, or whatever it is, just for the fun
      of it , just because one is able to do so! Just to show, with a pelt
      hanging near the fireplace, what a tough guy one is. Just to prove with a
      picture, where one is posing with a sheepish grin behind a bear carcass,
      or ‚Äì even worse ‚Äì with one foot on this carcass. I honestly dislike the
      hypocritical (is this the appropriate word?) attitude of our (german)
      hunting organisations: ‚ÄúWe accept the presence of those wolves only if we
      are allowed to manage them.‚Äù

      John,
      I doubt we really want to know. I never saw any tracks around the tree,
      so it may just be a deterant. (Joke‚Äôs on them!)
      My uncle reminded me that the elk are ‚Äúbrought in‚Äù at night in RMNP.
      My daughter said not to forget that cats will suck away your infant
      child‚Äôs breath and suffocate them in their sleep. (I told her that wasn‚Äôt
      really about wildlife and she reminded me that cats are not recognized as
      domesticated animals, smarty pants!)
      My son told me his friends said that you could sing to bears and they‚Äôd
      leave you alone-easy to see where that one came from.

      Pennsylvania is, arguably, one of the tamest states around, at least in
      the East, but that doesn‚Äôt stop some folks from reporting having seen a
      wolf or wolves in the state or Northeast. Here‚Äôs a comment one of my
      blog‚Äôs recent postings elicited from a reader. Cougars also attract the
      rumor-mill participants (wouldn‚Äôt one have been road-killed by now, given
      the presence of so many roads on the landscape?).
      ‚ÄúI saw a black wolf in SW Pennsylvania 2 years ago. At first it looked
      like a small-medium bear (due to distance). I ran to my truck to grab my
      spotting scope and was surprised to see that is was a wolf. I am a
      Biologist and so is one other person that was in our group. There is no
      chance that this animal was a coyote. I have lived in close proximity to
      several packs over the years and I know this animal was no coyote. I‚Äôm
      also willing to wager that it was no wild dog. Unfortunately it was too
      far away to get decent photos, but with the spotting scope we got very
      good looks.‚Äù

      By the way cobra. . your spelling is also correct, just not usual:
      ‚ÄúThere were lots of other spellings, too, of which catsup is the best
      known, a modification of catchup. You can blame Jonathan Swift for it if
      you like, since he used it first in 1730: ‚ÄúAnd, for our home-bred British
      cheer, Botargo, catsup, and caveer‚Äù. [Caveer is caviar; botargo is a
      fish-based relish made of the roe of the mullet or tunny.] That form was
      also once common in the US but is much less so these days, at least on
      bottle labels: all the big US manufacturers now call their product
      ketchup.‚Äù

      Here‚Äôs another rural legend:
      The mullet is a good hairstyle üòâ
      I‚Äôll also move my rural legend comments:
      I remember hearing a story from an IDFG person about how he was
      confronted by someone in Riggins, Idaho about how the IDFG was stocking
      grizzly bears, wolves, and rattlesnakes in the area.
      I‚Äôve also heard the stories about Yellowstone rangers being asked
      questions like:
      Why do they put the blue stuff in the lake?
      Why are the those little red dogs hanging out with the buffalo?
      When do the deer turn into elk/moose?
      As a fisheries person I overheard someone explaining that the trout
      hanging out with the salmon were bull trout that were going to dig up the
      eggs so they could eat them. They were actually jack Chinook salmon, or
      males that only spend one year in the ocean as compared to 2 or three.
      FYI, they die just like the rest of them. That‚Äôs the biggest
      misconception I would run across with people.

      Lets not forget the myth that little bells attached to your shoes will
      warn grizzlies away.

      ‚ÄúThe first outlined stage is a scarcity of wild game, be it due to
      habitat loss, seasonal migration or often times over-predation.
      Wolves begin approaching human habitations, though limiting their visits
      to nocturnal hours. Their presence is usually established by barking
      matches with local dogs.
      After a certain amount of time, wolves begin to frequent human
      habitations in daylight hours and observe people and livestock at a
      distance.
      The wolves begin acting bolder by attacking small stock and pets at
      daylight, sometimes pursuing their prey up to verandas. The wolves at
      this point do not focus on humans, but will growl and act threateningly
      toward them.
      The wolves begin attacking large bodied livestock and may follow riders.
      People begin to be harassed, usually in a playful manner. The wolves will
      chase people over short distances and nip at them, though will retreat if
      confronted.
      Wolves begin to attack people in predatory fashions. ‚Äù

      I came across you guys while looking for locations or anything on the
      email pictures going around of elk in someone‚Äôs Rocky Mountain suburban
      neighborhood. But while I‚Äôm here, can anyone tell me for sure once and
      for all the lowdown on bears and their people attacks and omnivorous
      behaviors? I was taught that the grizzlys and polars will attack people
      for food as well as self defense, but that other smaller bears only
      attack people in defense. Then I heard that all bears (except for pandas)
      will attack people for food. What‚Äôs the legend and what‚Äôs the truth of
      it?

      That is a lot of questions. We have discussed parts of this many times.
      Does anyone want to try an answer?

      Let‚Äôs not forget the wily critter of the plains and sagebrush. The trophy
      Jack-a-lope. A friend of mine had a sporting goods store in western
      colorado when I lived there. I would help him out at times with bore
      sighting rifles for the out of state hunters that would come into the
      store to buy their elk and deer tags. He had a Jack-a-lope mount on the
      wall and you wouldn‚Äôt believe how many people would belive that he had
      actually taken it not 5 miles from the store, some even asked if they had
      tags available. Those are the years I wore extra orange during the season
      and probably a big reason I started archery hunting more than rifle
      hunting.

      LisaM,
      Actually black bears have attacked more people than any of the others,
      but there are more black bears living where there are more people so
      there are more encounters. Personally I don‚Äôt trust any of them and
      respect all the predators, actually all wild animals. The only bear I‚Äôve
      ever had to dispose of had been wounded a week prior to our meeting by
      some other hunters that made a bad shot, he fell seven feet from my rifle
      barrel and scared the hell out of me at full charge, this however is not
      normal and he was a black. I‚Äôve had black bears close several times and
      they will dance on there forepaws back and forth woofing and huffing
      sometimes popping their teeth so loud you would think they would break,
      but every time I‚Äôve seen this I back out slowly and other than maybe
      having to clean out my drawers haven‚Äôt had problem. I‚Äôve read many books
      on documented bear attacks and all species will attack under the right
      circumstances. The main thing to do when in the woods I think is mainly
      be aware of your surroundings, pay attention to the tracks and scat,
      certain areas during certain times of the year are used more often than
      others by bears. Personally in North Idaho we have more encounters with
      moose than bears. Their big and can get kind of crazy during the rut and
      calving season.

      thanks guys ‚Äì a friend of mine forwarded those pictures, vicki ‚Äì I was
      just wondering where they were taken, but there was nothing there except
      ‚Äúrocky mountains‚Äù.
      So, do black bears attack people and deer, etc., for food regularly? I
      was under the impression that, like wolves, they normally kept to smaller
      stuff and fish, and being omnivorous, also relied on vegetation, so that
      they normally left people alone. I know about the tying up your grub when
      you‚Äôre out there, so the bears won‚Äôt get it, but there‚Äôs never really any
      warning about the bears getting You, unless you come between them and
      their food, or their younguns.

      I liked this on,
      Ranger tells everyone to wear bells around their neck and carry pepper
      spray to ward off bear attack. The bells alert the bears to your presence
      and the spray is a last ditch, ten feet, ‚Äúhail Mary‚Äù, when all else
      fails. He tells the hikers that there are two kinds of bears in the area:
      Grizzlies and Black bears. He then tells them that they need to recognize
      the bear‚Äôs scat so they can tell the two species apart. He sez that black
      bears are much less likely to attack, so when they see black bear scat,
      they may continue. But if they encounter grizzly scat, they should give
      the area a wide berth.
      A tourist asks how to tell the difference. The ranger replies,‚Äù Easy,
      black bears are grazers, more than fish eaters. The black bear scat is
      usually full of blackberry seeds, hackberrys and acorns and other plant
      life and it smells like almonds. Grizzly scat is larger and it is full of
      bells and smells like pepper spray‚Ä¶.

What makes a scary movie extra creepy? We would argue it‚Äôs the specter of
truth: that something bad or spooky can happen because we heard it happened for
real somewhere. Enter: urban legends. Stories are passed down through
generations‚Äîthey always have been. And sometimes unexplained rumors of
something that happened to someone somewhere can gain powerful momentum if
enough folks keep those stories alive with new details and new audiences. Urban
legends play on our biggest fears of the unknown: that something sinister could
be lurking in a place or situation we otherwise feel safe in. But they‚Äôre also
fantastic jumping off points for movies and more stories. We pulled together a
list of some of the creepiest movies based on or surrounding urban legends‚Äîjust
in time for your Halloween watch party viewing pleasure!
1.The Ring
[urban_legends_the_ring__|_rmrk*st_|_Remarkist_Magazine]
The 2002 movie The Ring, inspired by the Japanese horror film Ringu (itself
inspired by the 1991 novel Ring by Koji Suzuki) relies on the urban legend of a
cursed videotape that, when watched, leads to the viewer‚Äôs death seven days
later unless they can solve the mystery surrounding it. This concept of a
cursed video or image leading to doom is linked to several urban legends, but
one of the most prominent is the Japanese kuchisake-onna (Slit-Mouthed Woman)
legend where a vengeful female spirit appears with a disfigured face and asks
potential victims if they find her beautiful. Depending on their answer, she
either kills them or harms them. The Ring urban legend plays on the broader
concept of a jinx or cursed media, where engaging with specific content (like a
tape, or photo) has a supernatural consequence. The idea of cursed objects or
communication causing death has a long history in folklore worldwide, ranging
from cursed paintings to cursed phone numbers. The cursed videotape in The Ring
serves as a modern adaptation of these older legends.
2.Candyman
[urban_legends_candyman__|_rmrk*st_|_Remarkist_Magazine]
Have you ever been at a sleepover and gathered with friends in the bathroom to
chant ‚ÄúBloody Mary‚Äù while staring into the mirror? ‚Ä¶Just us? Well, the 1992
horror film Candyman is based on author Clive Barker‚Äôs short story The
Forbidden, but it is heavily influenced by urban legends, particularly ‚ÄúBloody
Mary.‚Äù In this story, however, the ghost of a hook-handed man appears when
someone says his name five times in front of a mirror. (It‚Äôs giving
Beetlejuice.) This directly, ahem, mirrors the Bloody Mary game, in which a
spirit is said to appear when her name is chanted multiple times while looking
in a mirror. Both legends involve summoning a deadly supernatural entity
through a ritual, usually a dare. Candyman also has another important element
that often goes hand in hand with urban legends: the theme of racial violence
and injustice. The backstory of the Candyman character is that he was a Black
artist named Daniel Robitaille, who was brutally lynched in the late 19th
century for having a romantic relationship with a white woman. He was tortured
by having his hand cut off and replaced with a hook, and this racially charged
backstory makes Candyman a complex blend of horror and commentary on the
historical mistreatment of Black people. The setting of the film further digs
into the often unfair and racially charged fears and anxieties of urban life,
including poverty and crime.
3.I Know What You Did Last Summer
[urban_legends_I_know_what_you_did_last_summer__|_rmrk*st_|_Remarkist_Magazine]
Based on Lois Duncan‚Äôs 1973 novel of the same name, the 1997 slasher film, I
Know What You Did Last Summer, is inspired by a famous urban legend. Often
referred to as ‚ÄúThe Hook‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Hookman‚Äù the legend features a hook-handed
killer who stalks and attacks young couples, often parked in a secluded,
‚Äúlover‚Äôs lane‚Äù area. A couple hears a news report on the radio about an escaped
mental patient or killer with a hook for a hand. They become frightened and
decide to leave the area, only to later discover a hook hanging from the car
door, suggesting the killer was recently nearby. The story plays on fears of
vulnerable teens being attacked in isolated locations.
In I Know What You Did Last Summer, a group of teenagers accidentally hit a man
with their car and, thinking he‚Äôs dead, dispose of the body. A year later, they
begin receiving threatening messages from someone who says they know what they
did and soon begin being stalked by a killer wielding a hook. The movie expands
the original urban legend, but the origin is still there.
4.Slender Man
[slender_man_movie_urban_legends__|_rmrk*st_|_Remarkist_Magazine]
Born from a modern urban legend that originated in the digital space (as
opposed to urban legends that are passed down through stories over decades),
the Slender Man was created in 2009 by Eric Knudsen (alias ‚ÄúVictor Surge‚Äù) on
the online forum Something Awful. It quickly took on a life of its own and
became an internet myth, gaining widespread influence as other users
contributed additional stories, artwork, and videos to the character‚Äôs lore.
Slender Man is typically depicted as a tall, thin figure with a featureless
white face and tentacle-like appendages. He is often shown wearing a black
suit, and he stalks, abducts, or influences children and teens, leading them
into forests or causing them to act irrationally. The character‚Äôs lack of
distinct features makes him especially unsettling, and he has become associated
with psychological horror and the idea of losing control to a mysterious
force.¬†
The 2018 movie Slender Man is about a group of teenage girls who summon the
Slender Man through an online ritual and then find themselves haunted by him.
The film taps into fears around the dangers of the internet, how myths and
memes can spiral into something terrifying, and how they can influence
vulnerable minds. In a tragic real-life twist, this urban legend was also tied
to a real-life incident in 2014, when two 12-year-old girls in Wisconsin
stabbed a classmate in an attempt to appease Slender Man, believing that they
would become his proxies. While the film does not directly address the crime,
the real-world implications of the Slender Man legend added an additional layer
of creepiness to the character.
5.The Mothman Prophecies
[the_mothman_prophecies_urban_legends__|_rmrk*st_|_Remarkist_Magazine]
The 2002 film, based on John Keel‚Äôs 1975 book of the same name, The Mothman
Prophecies was inspired by real-life events and an urban legend surrounding the
mysterious creature known as the Mothman. The legend originates from sightings
in the small town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, during the mid-1960s.
Keel‚Äôs book explores his investigations into the sightings and their possible
connection to supernatural phenomena and tragic events. In 1966 gravediggers in
Clendenin, West Virginia, claimed to have seen a large humanoid figure with
wings flying overhead and two young couples reported seeing a man-sized
creature with large wings and glowing red eyes who could fly at incredibly high
speeds and follow their car as they fled the area. Over the next year, many
residents of Point Pleasant reported sightings of the Mothman, and in some
cases, witnesses experienced feelings of dread, anxiety, or paranormal events
after encountering the creature.¬†
In 1967, the Silver Bridge, which connected Point Pleasant to Ohio over the
Ohio River, suddenly collapsed, killing 46 people. The collapse was attributed
to a structural failure, but many locals believed that the Mothman sightings
were an omen predicting the disaster, and after it happened there were less
reports of Mothman sightings. In the movie, a journalist, played by Richard
Gere, investigates the strange sightings and prophetic warnings in a small
town. Using the real-life reports and the Silver Bridge disaster as a backdrop,
the film amplifies the eerie idea that the Mothman may be a supernatural being
or entity that foreshadows catastrophe, weaving elements of mystery, paranoia,
and the unexplained into the narrative.
6.Blair Witch Project
[blair_witch_project_urban_legends__|_rmrk*st_|_Remarkist_Magazine]
This 1999 movie wasn‚Äôt based on an urban legend per se, but it used the idea of
urban legends and folklore to scare viewers. Also? The filmmakers created and
disseminated a fictional urban legend of their own‚Äîto promote the film, of
course. Early internet culture helped to make their fictional legend seem real:
the filmmakers created a website that presented the Blair Witch story as
genuine folklore, complete with fake newspaper articles, journal entries, and
‚Äúmissing person‚Äù reports about the disappearance of the film‚Äôs protagonists.
This viral marketing campaign, which blurred the line between reality and
fiction (how quaint to imagine this in modern day!), smartly mimicked the way
urban legends spread in the modern age, using the internet as a new medium for
word-of-mouth. The legend in the movie was designed to feel like an authentic,
ancient myth, and the film cleverly presents it as if it were real, using a
‚Äúfound footage‚Äù style to add to the illusion of authenticity. In it, three
student filmmakers‚ÄîHeather, Josh, and Mike‚Äîventure into the woods near
Burkittsville, Maryland in 1994 to make a documentary about the Blair Witch
legend.¬†
According to this fictional lore, which we see play out in The Blair Witch
Project, the Blair Witch is a vengeful spirit tied to the town of Burkittsville
(formerly called Blair). The legend spans centuries, beginning with the story
of Elly Kedward, a woman accused of witchcraft in 1785 and banished to the
woods after children accused her of luring them to her house to draw blood.
Kedward was presumed to have died in the wilderness, but soon after her
disappearance, the townspeople began to vanish, and the remaining villagers
abandoned Blair, convinced that the area was cursed. The legend suggests that
Kedward's spirit, known as the ‚ÄúBlair Witch,‚Äù haunted the woods around
Burkittsville, causing mysterious disappearances and deaths over the years. The
legend goes further, citing the abduction of a group of children in the 1940s
by a man named Rustin Parr who killed them in his cabin,¬† claiming that the
Blair Witch made him do it. All of this lore adds to the realness of this fake
documentary-style movie, and it even fooled some audiences into believing that
the legend really existed.
7.Urban Legend
[urban_legend_movie__|_rmrk*st_|_Remarkist_Magazine]
Finally, the 1998 horror film Urban Legendillustrates exactly why urban legends
are excellent fodder for a scary movie. Set on a college campus, a series of
gruesome student murders start happening‚Äìand they seem to reflect commonly
known urban legends. Indeed, the killer in the film uses these legends as
inspiration for creative killings, and the plot heavily relies on the audience
recognizing these myths. Among the common urban legends depicted are the
lover‚Äôs lane hookman (very I Know What You Did Last Summer), a killer hiding in
the backseat waiting to strike, the call coming from inside the house, the
Bloody Mary myth, pop rocks and soda combo death, flashing headlight gang
initiations, kidney heist/organ theft, and more. The film helps perpetuate
these urban legend fears, and that of course makes it easier to build a
franchise of sequels! But one thing is made clear: urban legends will always be
passed from generation to generation, and like story tropes, serve as endless
inspiration for creators of thrilling content.

****** Bogus St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Legends and What We Can Memorialize ******
 by  Carl_McRoy
 [shamrock gold rainbow irish st patrick]
 Views: 35
[image_pdf][image_print]
Being born on March 17, and having an Irish surname leads me to have more
reflections and conversations about St. Patrick‚Äôs Day than the average person,
as_I_wrote_two_years_ago. This time we‚Äôre going to look at some of the myths
related to the man, St. Patrick.
*** Shamrocks ***
Legend has it that British-born St. Patrick used a shamrock to teach Irish
pagans about the trinity. However, there‚Äôs a few problems with this:
1) The word shamrock doesn‚Äôt come into use until a thousand years after St.
Patrick‚Äôs death and it took nearly as long for this legend to develop.
2) There‚Äôs disagreement on if there actually is such a thing as a shamrock and,
if it they exist, if they‚Äôre capable of growing in non-Irish soil.
3) Most significantly, St. Patrick never alludes to anything like this in his
only two extant writings, the Confessio and the Epistola. Aside from these two
documents, we really don‚Äôt know anything else about Ireland‚Äôs British Bishop.
*** Snakes ***
Ever heard about St. Patrick chasing all the snakes out of Ireland? Uh-uh.
Nope. Didn‚Äôt happen since the island never had snakes. And, again, he never
wrote anything about chasing, killing, or even screaming and running away from
snakes. Nobody mentions this legend until 600 years after the approximate date
of his death.
And, about that date. March 17 is said to be St. Patrick‚Äôs date of death, not
birth. Nobody recorded the date, it just showed up on liturgical calendar
centuries later.
*** Slavery ***
Patrick‚Äôs father had a successful business, enriched by slave labor.
Ironically, Patrick was kidnapped from Britain and sold into slavery in Ireland
at age 16. After six-years-a-slave, Patrick escaped back to Britain. He trained
for the ministry and dreamed that God was calling him to go back to preach in
Ireland. He was enslaved again for a short period of time, but Patrick refused
to be deterred from his purpose, describing himself as being bound by the
Spirit to minister in the land of his captivity.
*** Souls over Gold ***
As soon as Valentine‚Äôs Day ends, naked cupids are displaced by leprechauns
(clothed, thankfully) on retail shelves. Is this a case of Roman icons being
gentrified by Irish ones? Anyway, the clever little creatures with pots of gold
at the end of rainbows have nothing to do with St. Patrick. This saint
developed a love for souls over gold and argued for people to be prized over
possessions.
St. Patrick wrote his fiery Epistola as a call for repentance and reparations
from those who had killed, enslaved, and sold women and men he had just
baptized and anointed. In doing so, he was putting his life on the line for a
wholistic ministry. He wasn‚Äôt satisfied with people‚Äôs soul‚Äôs being saved while
their bodies were in bondage:
     It is not that I would choose to let anything so blunt and harsh come
     from my mouth, but I am driven by the zeal for God. And the truth of
     Christ stimulates me, for love of neighbors and children: for these,
     I have given up my homeland and my parents, and my very life to
     death‚Ä¶
     The Most High does not accept the gifts of evildoers. The one who
     offers a sacrifice taken from what belongs to the poor is like one
     who sacrifices a child in the very sight of the child‚Äôs father.
     Riches, says Scripture, which a person gathers unjustly, will be
     vomited out of that person‚Äôs stomach. The angel of death will drag
     such a one away, to be crushed by the anger of dragons.
St. Patrick continued by urging his followers to resist flattering these
traffickers and to boycott them instead:
     [A]ll the holy and humble of heart should not fawn on such people,
     nor even share food or drink with them, nor accept their alms, until
     such time as they make satisfaction to God in severe penance and
     shedding of tears, and until they set free the men-servants of God
     and the baptised women servants of Christ, for whom he died and was
     crucified.
Shouldn‚Äôt commemorations of St. Patrick‚Äôs legacy set higher goals than wearing
green clothes, eating green cookies and cupcakes, and turning rivers green for
a day? Why not draft modern versions of the Epistola, instead of getting drunk
on green beer?
