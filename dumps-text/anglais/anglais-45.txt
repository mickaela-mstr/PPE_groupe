   The title that Nintendo chose for the series has led to a lot of
   confusion, even now, with people still confusing Zelda and Link.
   Basically, through the long and short of it, the primary focus of every
   game is on Link, so the title does seem a little off, but "Legend of
   Link" doesn't quite have the same ring to it (not to mention the
   confusion of "LoL" and "lol" - they somehow preempted that by 30
   years!)

   But, Zelda is just as much an important character in the series as
   Link, and even Ganon (or Ganondorf), so does the title link itself* to
   more than just a character? What is Zelda's Legend?

       If people still confuse Zelda and Link as characters, its probably
       because they don't play video games.

       @KimberlyW in truth, and I am ashamed to admit this, I initially
       thought that Link was Zelda, the first time I played the game (OoT
       was my first installment in the series).

   The first The Legend of Zelda game was focused on rescuing Zelda from
   the clutches of Gannon, as his name was originally spelt. The decision
   to name the game after the princess instead of the player is probably
   due in large part to the ability to pick your own name. The argument
   over many years for Link to have no voice was that the player is meant
   to feel like they aren't controlling another character, but instead are
   a part of the game.

   In the immediate sequel they dropped "The Legend" and opted for Zelda
   II: The Adventure of Link. This sequel wasn't as well received, so as
   they continued with the series perhaps it was a marketing decision to
   draw the attention of fans of the original.

   As for what The Legend is, you have to look at the first game in the
   timeline, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. In that game this Zelda
   is not a princess, but the first human/mortal reincarnation of the
   goddess Hylia. This is further explained at the back of the Hyrule
   Historia book in a translated manga titled The Legend is Born, a page
   of which I have taken a photo of.

   Whenever the land of Hylia is in danger… we shall be reborn…

   Long story short: Zelda is the reincarnation of Hylia, the goddess of
   the world seen in the games. Link, while important, is a creation of
   Hylia, not a god himself.

       I think it's fair to say that at the time of release of the first
       game, the legend simply was the story of the game. Tons of games
       were called "legend of <something>" at the time, and those were
       always games where the story was the legend the title referred to.
       Zelda was no exception.

   There really is an in-universe "Legend of Zelda", mentioned in the
   instruction manual of Zelda II as told by Impa:

     "Link, the time has come when I must tell you the legend of Zelda
     handed down in Hyrule. It is said that long ago, when Hyrule was one
     country, a great ruler maintained the peace in Hyrule using the
     Triforce. However, the king too was a child of man and he died.
     Then, the prince of the kingdom should have become king and
     inherited everything, but he could inherit the Triforce only in
     part. The prince searched everywhere for the missing parts, but
     could not find them."

     "Then, a magician close to the king brought him some unexpected
     news. Before he died, the king had said something about the Triforce
     to only the younger sister of the prince, Princess Zelda. The prince
     immediately questioned the princess, but she wouldn't tell him
     anything. After the prince, the magician threatened to put the
     princess into an eternal sleep if she did not talk, but even still,
     she said nothing."

     "In his anger, the magician tried to cast a magic spell on the
     princess. The surprised prince tried to stop him, but the magician
     fought off the prince and went on chanting the spell. Then, when the
     spell was finally cast, Princess Zelda fell on that spot and entered
     a sleep from which she might never awake. At the same time, the
     magician also fell down and breathed his last."

     "In his grief, the prince placed the princess in this room. He hoped
     that someday she would come back to life. So that this tragedy would
     never be forgotten, he ordered that every female child born into the
     royal household shall be given the name Zelda."

   And although Zelda II may be one of the lesser-popular entries of the
   series today & did sell less than the original, it was actually fairly
   well-received in its day, and remained in Nintendo Power's Top 20/30 &
   Players' Picks lists for a good five years, regularly placing in the
   former even up to December 1994 (the last Top 20 to include NES games).

     * Thanks for your answer! It's actually interesting to see the two
       versions of the same story, which are both legitimate answers. My
       only recommendation would be to re-word your last paragraph -
       "accusing" other users of being "wrong" (whether true or not),
       often isn't very well received .

     * Gwellin's answer didn't say Zelda 2 wasn't well received, just that
       this "sequel wasn't as well received" (as the first game). As I
       recall, Zelda 1 ended up outranking Zelda 2 after some time.

       @Ben You're right, and thanks for the advice. Sorry if my last
       paragraph came across as confrontational. I reworded it to be a bit
       more civil. I didn't mean to criticize Gwellin's answer, but I
       admit I do get irked when Zelda II is treated as an outcast of
       sorts (even by the game's own developers!) when, looking back, the
       game was actually received rather well.

     * I appreciate it. I thought of pointing out my wording and
       intentions, but didn't take offence. Zelda II is a good game that
       suffers from being too different from what everyone expected, which
       tends to mean fewer people give it a try. I know some intense fans
       of Zelda II, and have learnt to appreciate the game much more from
       them.

       At the time of this writing, this insightful answer linked to Zelda
       2's manual from a third party site, ZeldaCapital.com A more
       official resource would be the one at Zelda 2's English Manual
       hosted by Nintendo of Japan (hyperlink going to PDF page 7
       (identified as page 6 in the PDF contents), which is where the
       answer sensibly starts quoting from, but the storyline itself (and
       great artwork) does start 3 pages earlier...

   This was found within the initial game:

   The Legend of Zelda: Many years ago Prince Darkness Gannon stole one of
   the Triforce with Power. Princess Zelda had one of the Triforce with
   Wisdom. She divided it into " 8" units to hide it from Gannon before
   she was captured. Go find the 8 units " Link" to save her.

   To see this, all you had to do was wait at the title screen. (Simply do
   not press the Start button on the title screen. The music will get a
   bit more up-beat and this will scroll onto the screen for a bit.)

   You could say that the title at the top of this screen represented the
   name of the game, but I always thought of this text as the simplified,
   summarized version of the legend.

   The instruction manual for the first game introduced a slightly longer
   backstory, noting Link saved a woman named Impa who told Link this
   information.

     A long, long time ago the World was in an age of Chaos. In the
     middle of this chaos, in a little kingdom in the land of Hyrule, a
     legend was being handed down from generation to generation, the
     legend of the 'Triforce'; golden triangles possessing mystical
     powers.

     One day, an evil army attacked this peaceful little kingdom and
     stole the Triforce of Power. This army was led by Gannon, the
     powerful Prince of Darkness who sought to plunge the World into fear
     and darkness under his rule. Fearing his wicked rule, Zelda, the
     princess of this kingdom, split up the Triforce of Wisdom into eight
     fragments and hid them throughout the realm to save the last
     remaining Triforce from the clutches of the evil Ganon. At the same
     time, she commanded her most trustworthy nursemaid, Impa, to
     secretly escape into the land and go find a man with enough courage
     to destroy the evil Gannon. Upon hearing this, Ganon grew angry,
     imprisoned the princess, and sent out a party in search of Impa.

     Braving forests and mountains, Impa fled for her life from her
     pursuers. As she reached the very limit of her energy she found
     herself surrounded by Gannon’s evil henchmen. Cornered! What could
     she do? … But wait!

     All was not lost. A young lad appeared. He skillfully drove off
     Ganon’s henchmen, and saved Impa from a fate worse than death. His
     name was Link. During his travels he had come across Impa and
     Ganon’s henchmen. Impa told Link the whole story of the princess
     Zelda and the evil Ganon. Burning with a sense of justice, Link
     resolved to save Zelda, but Ganon was a powerful opponent. He held
     the Triforce of Power. And so, in order to fight off Ganon, Link had
     to bring the scattered eight fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom
     together to rebuild the mystical Triangle.

     If he couldn't do this, there would be no chance Link could fight
     his way into Death Mountain where Ganon lived. Can Link really
     destroy Ganon and save the Princess Zelda? Only your skill can
     answer that question. Good luck. Use the Triforce wisely.

   (Text found from Zelda.Wikia.com: The Legend of Zelda: Prologue.)

   That story came from a couple of pages from the manual, where this
   story appeared on top of a drawing of the land of Hyrule:

   Story over Hyrule

   hyperlink to the actual introduction sequence in action, where the
   summarized text is shown in the actual cartridge. If you'd like to gaze

       "Gannon" doesn't take over "Hyrule". I would totally be "grateful"

       The answer includes a picture from some pages in manual. Nintendo
       of Japan has since published the English manual online, so you can
       see that at
       nintendo.co.jp/clv/manuals/en/pdf/CLV-P-NAANE.pdf#page=4 (and zoom
       in more than the picture showin in the answer).
