     Genre(s)   MOBA
     Mode(s)    Multiplayer

   League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009
   multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by
   Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for
   Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in
   the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, League has been
   free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character
   customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.

   In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player
   combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each
   of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with
   unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match,
   champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning
   gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In League's
   main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy
   base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.

   League of Legends has received generally positive reviews; critics have
   highlighted its accessibility, character designs, and production value.
   The game's long lifespan has resulted in a critical reappraisal, with
   reviews trending positively; it is widely considered one of the
   greatest video games ever made. However, negative and abusive in-game
   player behavior, criticized since the game's early days, persists
   despite Riot's attempts to fix the problem. In 2019, League regularly
   peaked at eight million concurrent players, and its popularity has led
   to tie-ins such as music, comic books, short stories, and the animated
   series Arcane. Its success has spawned several spin-off video games,
   including a mobile version, a digital collectible card game, and a
   turn-based role-playing game, among others. A massively multiplayer
   online role-playing game based on the property is in development.

   League of Legends is the world's largest esport, with an international
   competitive scene consisting of multiple regional leagues that
   culminate in an annual League of Legends World Championship. The 2019
   event registered over 100 million unique viewers, peaking at a
   concurrent viewership of 44 million during the finals. Domestic and
   international events have been broadcast on livestreaming websites such
   as Twitch, YouTube, Bilibili, and the cable television sports channel
   ESPN.

   League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in
   which the player controls a character ("champion") with a set of unique
   abilities from an isometric perspective.^[2]^[3] As of 2024,^[update]
   there are 168 champions available to play.^[4] Over the course of a
   match, champions gain levels by accruing experience points (XP) through
   killing enemies.^[5] Items can be acquired to increase champions'
   strength,^[6] and are bought with gold, which players accrue passively
   over time and earn actively by defeating the opposing team's
   minions,^[2] champions, or defensive structures.^[5]^[6] In the main
   game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are purchased through a shop menu
   available to players only when their champion is in the team's
   base.^[2] Each match is discrete; levels and items do not transfer from
   one match to another.^[7]

Summoner's Rift

   The game's main map. It is a square, with the team bases on the top
   right and bottom right corners. There are three pathways to each base:
   one diagonally across the centre, and the others going up and turning
   at the top left and bottom right corners. A simplified representation
   of Summoner's Rift. The yellow paths are the "lanes" down which minions
   march; blue and red dots represent turrets. The fountains are the dark
   areas within each base, and are beside each Nexus. The dotted black
   line indicates the river.

   Summoner's Rift is the flagship game mode of League of Legends and the
   most prominent in professional-level play.^[8]^[9]^[10] The mode has a
   ranked competitive ladder; a matchmaking system determines a player's
   skill level and generates a starting rank from which they can climb.
   There are ten tiers; the least skilled are Iron, Bronze, and Silver,
   and the highest are Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger.^[11]^[a]

   Two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing team's
   "Nexus", which is guarded by the enemy champions and defensive
   structures known as "turrets".^[14] Each team's Nexus is located in
   their base, where players start the game and reappear after death.^[14]
   Non-player characters known as minions are generated from each team's
   Nexus and advance towards the enemy base along three lanes guarded by
   turrets: top, middle, and bottom.^[15] Each team's base contains three
   "inhibitors", one behind the third tower from the center of each lane.
   Destroying one of the enemy team's inhibitors causes stronger allied
   minions to spawn in that lane, and allows the attacking team to damage
   the enemy Nexus and the two turrets guarding it.^[16] The regions in
   between the lanes are collectively known as the "jungle", which is
   inhabited by "monsters" that, like minions, respawn at regular
   intervals. Like minions, monsters provide gold and XP when killed.^[17]
   Another, more powerful class of monster resides within the river that
   separates each team's jungle.^[18] These monsters require multiple
   players to defeat and grant special abilities to their slayers' team.
   For example, teams can gain a powerful allied unit after killing the
   Rift Herald, permanent strength boosts by killing dragons, and
   stronger, more durable minions by killing Baron Nashor.^[19]

   Summoner's Rift matches can last from as little as 15 minutes to over
   an hour.^[20] Although the game does not enforce where players may go,
   conventions have arisen over the game's lifetime: typically one player
   goes in the top lane, one in the middle lane, one in the jungle, and
   two in the bottom lane.^[2]^[5]^[21] Players in a lane kill minions to
   accumulate gold and XP (termed "farming") and try to prevent their
   opponent from doing the same. A fifth champion, known as a "jungler",
   farms the jungle monsters and, when powerful enough, assists their
   teammates in a lane.^[22]

Other modes

   Besides Summoner's Rift, League of Legends has two other permanent game
   modes. ARAM ("All Random, All Mid") is a five-versus-five mode like
   Summoner's Rift, but on a map called Howling Abyss with only one long
   lane, no jungle area, and with champions randomly chosen for
   players.^[23]^[24]^[25] Given the small size of the map, players must
   be vigilant in avoiding enemy abilities.^[26]

   Teamfight Tactics is an auto battler released in June 2019 and made a
   permanent game mode the following month.^[27]^[28] As with others in
   its genre, players build a team and battle to be the last one standing.
   Players do not directly affect combat but position their units on a
   board for them to fight automatically against opponents each
   round.^[29] Teamfight Tactics is available for iOS and Android and has
   cross-platform play with the Windows and macOS clients.^[30]

   Other game modes have been made available temporarily, typically
   aligning with in-game events.^[31]^[32] Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) mode was
   available for two weeks as a 2014 April Fools Day prank. In the mode,
   champion abilities have no resource cost, significantly reduced
   cooldown timers, increased movement speed, reduced healing, and faster
   attacks.^[33]^[34] A year later, in April 2015, Riot disclosed that
   they had not brought the mode back because its unbalanced design
   resulted in player "burnout". The developer also said the costs
   associated with maintaining and balancing URF were too high.^[35] Other
   temporary modes include One for All and Nexus Blitz. One for All has
   players pick a champion for all members of their team to
   play.^[36]^[37] In Nexus Blitz, players participate in a series of
   mini-games on a compressed map.^[38]

Development

Pre-release

   Games' West Los Angeles headquarters

   Riot Games' founders Brandon Beck and Marc Merill had an idea for a
   spiritual successor to Defense of the Ancients, known as DotA. A mod
   for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, DotA required players to buy Warcraft
   III and install custom software; The Washington Post's Brian Crecente
   said the mod "lacked a level of polish and was often hard to find and
   set up".^[39] Phillip Kollar of Polygon noted that Blizzard
   Entertainment supported Warcraft III with an expansion pack, then
   shifted their focus to other projects while the game still had players.
   Beck and Merill sought to create a game that would be supported over a
   significantly longer period.^[40]

   Beck and Merill held a DotA tournament for students at the University
   of Southern California, with an ulterior goal of recruitment. There
   they met Jeff Jew, later a producer on League of Legends. Jew was very
   familiar with DotA and spent much of the tournament teaching others how
   to play. Beck and Merill invited him to an interview, and he joined
   Riot Games as an intern.^[39] Beck and Merill recruited two figures
   involved with DotA: Steve Feak, one of its designers,^[39] and Steve
   Mescon, who ran a support website to assist players.^[41]^[42] Feak
   said early development was highly iterative, comparing it to designing
   DotA.^[43]

   A demonstration of League of Legends built in the Warcraft III game
   engine was completed in four months and then shown at the 2007 Game
   Developers Conference.^[40] There, Beck and Merill had little success
   with potential investors. Publishers were confused by the game's
   free-to-play business model and lack of a single-player mode. The
   free-to-play model was untested outside of Asian markets,^[39] so
   publishers were primarily interested in a retail release, and the
   game's capacity for a sequel.^[40] In 2008, Riot reached an agreement
   with holding company Tencent to oversee the game's launch in
   China.^[40]

   League of Legends was announced October 7, 2008, for Microsoft
   Windows.^[44]^[45] Closed beta-testing began in April 2009.^[44]^[46]
   Upon the launch of the beta, seventeen champions were available.^[47]
   Riot initially aimed to ship the game with 20 champions but doubled the
   number before the game's full release in North America on October 27,
   2009.^[48]^[49] The game's full name was announced as League of
   Legends: Clash of Fates. Riot planned to use the subtitle to signal
   when future content was available, but decided they were silly and
   dropped it before launch.^[40]

Post-release

   League of Legends receives regular updates in the form of patches.
   Although previous games had utilized patches to ensure no one strategy
   dominated, League of Legends' patches made keeping pace with the
   developer's changes a core part of the game. In 2014, Riot standardized
   their patch cadence to once approximately every two or three
   weeks.^[50]

   The development team includes hundreds of game designers and artists.
   In 2016, the music team had four full-time composers and a team of
   producers creating audio for the game and its promotional
   materials.^[51] As of 2021^[update], the game has over 150
   champions,^[52] and Riot Games periodically overhauls the visuals and
   gameplay of the oldest in the roster.^[53] Although only available for
   Microsoft Windows at launch, a Mac version of the game was made
   available in March 2013.^[54]

   In September 2024, Screen Actors Guild for radio and television placed
   League of Legends on a list barring the union's members from working on
   the game. This was to reprimand Formosa Interactive, a third-party
   audio provider used by Riot, for using a shell company to subvert the
   2024 SAG-AFTRA video game strike by employing non-union performers on a
   different game.^[55] Formosa denied the accusations in a statement,
   emphasising that it was unrelated to Riot.^[56] In a statement posted
   to X, Riot Games described League of Legends as a "union game" since
   2019 and said Formosa Interactive were directed to work only with union
   actors in the US. Riot described any complaints related to other games
   as unrelated to League of Legends.^[57]

Revenue model

   League of Legends uses a free-to-play business model. Several forms of
   purely cosmetic customization—for example, "skins" that change the
   appearance of champions—can be acquired after buying an in-game
   currency called Riot Points (RP).^[58] Skins have five main pricing
   tiers, ranging from $4 to $25.^[59] An additional "luxury" tier was
   announced in 2024 that cannot be purchased outright, but must be "won"
   using RP and an in-game slot machine mechanic.^[60] As virtual goods,
   they have high profit margins.^[51] A loot box system has existed in
   the game since 2016; these are purchasable virtual "chests" with
   randomized, cosmetic items.^[61] These chests can be bought outright or
   acquired at a slower rate for free by playing the game. The practice
   has been criticized as a form of gambling.^[62] In 2019, Riot Games'
   CEO said that he hoped loot boxes would become less prevalent in the
   industry.^[63] Riot has also experimented with other forms of
   monetization. In August 2019, they announced an achievement system
   purchasable with Riot Points. The system was widely criticized for its
   high cost and low value.^[64]

   In 2014, Ubisoft analyst Teut Weidemann said that only around 4% of
   players paid for cosmetics—significantly lower than the industry
   standard of 15 to 25%. He argued the game was only profitable because
   of its large player base.^[65] In 2017, the game had a revenue of
   US$2.1 billion;^[66] in 2018, a lower figure of $1.4 billion still
   positioned it as one of the highest-grossing games of 2018.^[67] In
   2019, the number rose to $1.5 billion, and again to $1.75 billion in
   2020.^[67]^[66] According to magazine Inc., players collectively played
   three billion hours every month in 2016.^[51]

Plot

   See also: League of Legends § Spin-offs and other media

   Before 2014, players existed in-universe as political leaders, or
   "Summoners", commanding champions to fight on the Fields of Justice—for
   example, Summoner's Rift—to avert a catastrophic war.^[68] Sociologist
   Matt Watson said the plot and setting were bereft of the political
   themes found in other role-playing games, and presented in reductive
   "good versus evil" terms.^[69] In the game's early development, Riot
   did not hire writers, and designers wrote character biographies only a
   paragraph long.^[40]

   In September 2014, Riot Games rebooted the game's fictional setting,
   removing summoners from the game's lore to avoid "creative
   stagnation".^[68]^[70] Luke Plunkett wrote for Kotaku that, although
   the change would upset long-term fans, it was necessary as the game's
   player base grew in size.^[71] Shortly after the reboot, Riot hired
   Warhammer writer Graham McNeill.^[72] Riot's storytellers and artists
   create flavor text, adding "richness" to the game, but very little of
   this is seen as a part of normal gameplay. Instead, that work supplies
   a foundation for the franchise's expansion into other media,^[51] such
   as comic books and spin-off video games.^[73]^[74] The Fields of
   Justice were replaced by a new fictional setting—a planet called
   Runeterra. The setting has elements from several genres—from
   Lovecraftian horror to traditional sword and sorcery fantasy.^[75]

   League of Legends received generally favorable reviews on its initial
   release, according to review aggregator website Metacritic.^[76] Many
   publications noted the game's high replay value.^[88]^[89]^[90] Kotaku
   reviewer Brian Crecente admired how items altered champion play
   styles.^[90] Quintin Smith of Eurogamer concurred, praising the amount
   of experimentation offered by champions.^[91] Comparing it to Defense
   of the Ancients, Rick McCormick of GamesRadar+ said that playing League
   of Legends was "a vote for choice over refinement".^[92]

   Given the game's origins, other reviewers frequently compared aspects
   of it to DotA. According to GamesRadar+ and GameSpot, League of Legends
   would feel familiar to those who had already played DotA.^[79]^[93] The
   game's inventive character design and lively colors distinguished the
   game from its competitors.^[85] Smith concluded his review by noting
   that, although there was not "much room for negativity", Riot's goal of
   refining DotA had not yet been realized.^[91]

   Although Crecente praised the game's free-to-play model,^[90] GameSpy's
   Ryan Scott was critical of the grind required for non-paying players to
   unlock key gameplay elements, calling it unacceptable in a competitive
   game.^[94]^[b] Many outlets said the game was underdeveloped.^[89]^[85]
   A physical version of the game was available for purchase from
   retailers; GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd said it was an inadvisable purchase
   because the value included $10 of store credit for an unavailable
   store.^[89] German site GameStar noted that none of the bonuses in that
   version were available until the launch period had ended and refused to
   carry out a full review.^[96] IGN's Steve Butts compared the launch to
   the poor state of CrimeCraft's release earlier in 2009; he indicated
   that features available during League of Legends's beta were removed
   for the release, even for those who purchased the retail version.^[85]
   Matches took unnecessarily long to find for players, with long queue
   times,^[90]^[85]^[97] and GameRevolution mentioned frustrating
   bugs.^[98]

   Some reviewers addressed toxicity in the game's early history. Crecente
   wrote that the community was "insular" and "whiney" when losing.^[90]
   Butts speculated that League of Legends inherited many of DotA's
   players, who had developed a reputation for being "notoriously hostile"
   to newcomers.^[85]

Reassessment

   Legends champion Nidalee

   Regular updates to the game have resulted in a reappraisal by some
   outlets; IGN's second reviewer, Leah B. Jackson, explained that the
   website's original review had become "obsolete".^[86] Two publications
   increased their original scores: GameSpot from 6 to 9,^[81]^[82] and
   IGN from 8 to 9.2.^[85]^[86] The variety offered by the champion roster
   was described by Steven Strom of PC Gamer as "fascinating";^[87]
   Jackson pointed to "memorable" characters and abilities.^[86] Although
   the items had originally been praised at release by other outlets such
   as Kotaku,^[90] Jackson's reassessment criticized the lack of item
   diversity and viability, noting that the items recommended to the
   player by the in-game shop were essentially required because of their
   strength.^[86]

   While reviewers were pleased with the diverse array of play styles
   offered by champions and their abilities,^[86]^[82]^[87] Strom thought
   that the female characters still resembled those in "horny Clash of
   Clans clones" in 2018.^[87] Two years before Strom's review, a champion
   designer responded to criticism by players that a young, female
   champion was not conventionally attractive. He argued that limiting
   female champions to one body type was constraining, and said progress
   had been made in Riot's recent releases.^[99]

   Comparisons persisted between the game and others in the genre.
   GameSpot's Tyler Hicks wrote that new players would pick up League of
   Legends quicker than DotA and that the removal of randomness-based
   skills made the game more competitive.^[82] Jackson described League of
   Legends' rate of unlock for champions as "a model of generosity", but
   less than DotA's sequel, Dota 2 (2013), produced by Valve, wherein
   characters are unlocked by default.^[86] Strom said the game was
   fast-paced compared to Dota 2's "yawning" matches, but slower than
   those of Blizzard Entertainment's "intentionally accessible" MOBA
   Heroes of the Storm (2015).^[87]

Accolades

   At the first Game Developers Choice Awards in 2010, the game won four
   major awards: Best Online Technology, Game Design, New Online Game, and
   Visual Arts.^[100] At the 2011 Golden Joystick Awards, it won Best
   Free-to-Play Game.^[101] Music produced for the game won a Shorty
   Award,^[102] and was nominated at the Hollywood Music in Media
   Awards.^[103]

   League of Legends has received awards for its contribution to esports.
   It was nominated for Best Esports Game at The Game Awards in 2017 and

   Specific events organized by Riot for esports tournaments have been
   recognized by awards ceremonies. Also at The Game Awards, the Riot won
   Best Esports Event for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 League World
   Championships.^[106]^[107]^[108] At the 39th Sports Emmy Awards in
   2018, League of Legends won Outstanding Live Graphic Design for the
   2017 world championship; as part of the pre-competition proceedings,
   Riot used augmented reality technology to have a computer-generated
   dragon fly across the stage.^[109]^[110]^[111]

Player behavior

   League of Legends' player base has a longstanding reputation for
   "toxicity"—negative and abusive in-game behavior,^[112]^[113]^[114]
   with a survey by the Anti-Defamation League indicating that 76% of
   players have experienced in-game harassment.^[115] Riot Games has
   acknowledged the problem and responded that only a small portion of the
   game's players are consistently toxic. According to Jeffrey Lin, the
   lead designer of social systems at Riot Games, the majority of negative
   behavior is committed by players "occasionally acting out".^[116]
   Several major systems have been implemented to tackle the issue. One
   such measure is basic report functionality; players can report
   teammates or opponents who violate the game's code of ethics. The
   in-game chat is also monitored by algorithms that detect several types
   of abuse.^[116] An early system was the "Tribunal"—players who met
   certain requirements were able to review reports sent to Riot. If
   enough players determined that the messages were a violation, an
   automated system would punish them.^[117] Lin said that eliminating
   toxicity was an unrealistic goal, and the focus should be on rewarding
   good player behavior.^[118] To that effect, Riot reworked the "Honor
   system" in 2017, allowing players to award teammates with virtual
   medals following games, for one of three positive attributes. Acquiring
   these medals increases a player's "Honor level", rewarding them with
   free loot boxes over time.^[119]

In esports

   The 2016 League of Legends World Championship finals between SK Telecom
   T1 and Samsung Galaxy at the Staples Center
   Main article: League of Legends in esports

   League of Legends is one of the world's largest esports, described by
   The New York Times as its "main attraction".^[120] Online viewership
   and in-person attendance for the game's esports events outperformed
   those of the National Basketball Association, the World Series, and the
   Stanley Cup in 2016.^[121] For the 2019 and 2020 League of Legends
   World Championship finals, Riot Games reported 44 and 45 peak million
   concurrent viewers respectively.^[122]^[123] Harvard Business Review
   said that League of Legends epitomized the birth of the esports
   industry.^[124]

   As of April 2021^[update], Riot Games operates 12 regional leagues
   internationally,^[125]^[126]^[127] four of which—China, Europe, Korea,
   and North America—have franchised
   systems.^[128]^[129]^[130]^[131]^[132] In 2017, this system comprised
   109 teams and 545 players.^[133] League games are typically
   livestreamed on platforms such as Twitch and YouTube.^[123] The company
   sells streaming rights to the game;^[51] the North American league
   playoff is broadcast on cable television by sports network ESPN.^[134]
   In China, the rights to stream international events such as the World
   Championships and the Mid-Season Invitational were sold to Bilibili in
   Fall 2020 for a three-year deal reportedly worth US$113
   million,^[135]^[136]^[137] while exclusive streaming rights for the
   domestic and other regional leagues are owned by Huya Live.^[138] The
   game's highest-paid professional players have commanded salaries of
   above $1 million—over three times the highest-paid players of
   Overwatch.^[139] The scene has attracted investment from businesspeople
   otherwise unassociated with esports, such as retired basketball player
   Rick Fox, who founded his own team.^[140] In 2020, his team's slot in
   the North American league was sold to the Evil Geniuses organization
   for $33 million.^[141]

Spin-offs and other media

   Further information: List of League of Legends media

Games

   For the 10th anniversary of League of Legends in 2019, Riot Games
   announced several games at various stages of production that were
   directly related to the League of Legends intellectual property
   (IP).^[142]^[143] A stand-alone version of Teamfight Tactics was
   announced for mobile operating systems iOS and Android at the event and
   released in March 2020. The game has cross-platform play with the
   Windows and macOS clients.^[30] Legends of Runeterra, a free-to-play
   digital collectible card game, launched in April 2020 for Microsoft
   Windows; the game features characters from League of
   Legends.^[144]^[145]^[146] League of Legends: Wild Rift is a version of
   the game for mobile operating systems Android and iOS.^[147] Instead of
   porting the game from League of Legends, Wild Rift's character models
   and environments were entirely rebuilt.^[148] A single-player,
   turn-based role-playing game, Ruined King: A League of Legends Story,
   was released in 2021 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox
   Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Windows.^[74] It was the first title
   released under Riot Games' publishing arm, Riot Forge, wherein non-Riot
   studios develop games using League of Legends characters.^[149] In
   December 2020, Greg Street, vice-president of IP and Entertainment at
   Riot Games, announced that a massively multiplayer online role-playing
   game based on the game is in development.^[150] Song of Nunu: A League
   of Legends Story, a third-person adventure game revolving around the
   champion Nunu's search for his mother, with the help of the yeti
   Willump, was announced for a planned release in 2022. It is being
   developed by Tequila Works, the creators of Rime.^[151] It was released
   on Windows and the Nintendo Switch on November 1, 2023.^[152]

Music

   Riot Games' first venture into music was in 2014 with the virtual heavy
   metal band Pentakill, promoting a skin line of the same
   name.^[153]^[154] Initially, Pentakill consisted of six champions:
   Kayle, Karthus, Mordekaiser, Olaf, Sona, and Yorick. In 2021, Viego was
   introduced to the group. Their music was primarily made by Riot Games'
   in-house music team but featured cameos by Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy
   Lee and Danny Lohner, a former member of industrial rock band Nine Inch
   Nails. Their second album, Grasp of the Undying, reached number one on
   the iTunes metal charts in 2017.^[154]

   Pentakill was followed by K/DA, a virtual K-pop girl group composed of
   four champions, Ahri, Akali, Evelynn, and Kai'sa. As with Pentakill,
   K/DA is promotional material for a skin line by the same name.^[155]
   The group's debut single, "Pop/Stars", which premiered at the 2018
   League of Legends World Championship, garnered over 400 million views
   on YouTube and sparked widespread interest from people unfamiliar with
   League of Legends.^[156] After a two-year hiatus, in August 2020, Riot
   Games released "The Baddest", the pre-release single for All Out, the
   five-track debut EP from K/DA which followed in November that
   year.^[157]

   In 2019, Riot created a virtual hip hop group called True Damage,^[158]
   featuring the champions Akali, Yasuo, Qiyana, Senna, and Ekko.^[159]
   The vocalists—Keke Palmer, Thutmose, Becky G, Duckwrth, and
   Soyeon—performed a live version of the group's debut song, "Giants",
   during the opening ceremony of the 2019 League of Legends World
   Championship, alongside holographic versions of their characters.^[159]
   The in-game cosmetics promoted by the music video featured a
   collaboration with fashion house Louis Vuitton.^[160]

   In 2023, Riot formed Heartsteel, a virtual boy band, comprising the
   champions Aphelios, Ezreal, Kayn, K'Sante, Sett, and Yone. The
   vocalists are Baekhyun from the K-pop groups Exo and SuperM, Cal
   Scruby, ØZI, and Tobi Lou. Heartsteel's debut single "Paranoia" was
   released in October of that year.^[161]

Comics

   Riot announced a collaboration with Marvel Comics in 2018.^[73] Riot
   had previously experimented with releasing comics through its
   website.^[162]^[163] Shannon Liao of The Verge noted that the comic
   books were "a rare opportunity for Riot to showcase its years of lore
   that has often appeared as an afterthought".^[73] The first comic was
   League of Legends: Ashe—Warmother, which debuted in 2018, followed by
   League of Legends: Lux that same year.^[164] A print version of the
   latter was released in 2019.^[165]

Animated series

   In a video posted to celebrate the tenth anniversary of League of
   Legends, Riot announced an animated television series, Arcane,^[166]
   the company's first production for television.^[167] Arcane was a
   collaborative effort between Riot Games and animation studio Fortiche
   Production.^[167] In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, head of
   creative development Greg Street said the series is "not a
   light-hearted show. There are some serious themes that we explore
   there, so we wouldn't want kids tuning in and expecting something that
   it's not."^[166] The series is set in the utopian city of Piltover and
   its underground, oppressed sister city, Zaun.^[167]^[168]^[169] It
   stars Hailee Steinfeld as Vi, Ella Purnell as Jinx, Kevin Alejandro as
   Jayce, and Katie Leung as Caitlyn.^[170] The series was set to be
   released in 2020 but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.^[171] On
   November 6, 2021, Arcane premiered its first season on Netflix
   following the 2021 League of Legends World Championship,^[172] and was
   available through Tencent Video in China.^[167] It received critical
   acclaim upon release, with IGN's Rafael Motomayor asking rhetorically
   if the series marked the end of the "video game adaptation
   curse".^[173] A second and final season was released in November 2024
   to a similarly positive critical response.^[174]^[175]

Notes

    1. ^ Earlier, there were seven tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum,
       Diamond, Master, and Challenger. Iron and Grandmaster were added in
       2018, and Emerald (a tier between Platinum and Diamond) in
       2023.^[12]^[13]
    2. ^ Scott's review referenced a now-retired system of in-game bonuses
       to champions which could be slowly earned while playing or
       purchased outright with real money.^[95]
