   Legend is a 2015 biographical drama film written and directed by Brian
   Helgeland, adapted from John Pearson's book The Profession of Violence:
   The Rise and Fall of the Kray Twins.^[6]^[7] The film follows the Kray
   twins' career and relationship together through their life imprisonment
   in 1969.^[8]^[9]

   Tom Hardy, Emily Browning, David Thewlis and Christopher Eccleston star
   with Colin Morgan, Chazz Palminteri, Paul Bettany, Tara Fitzgerald,
   Taron Egerton, and the singer Duffy in supporting roles.

Plot

   [edit]

   In the 1960s, Reggie Kray is a former boxer who has become an important
   part of the criminal underground in London. At the start of the film,
   his twin brother Ron is locked up in a psychiatric hospital for
   paranoid schizophrenia. Reggie uses threats to obtain the premature
   release of his brother. The twins unite their efforts to control a
   large part of London's criminal underworld, made easier when the head
   of the south London Richardson Gang (a.k.a. the Torture Gang) is
   imprisoned. One of their first efforts is to muscle in on the control
   of a local nightclub, using extortion and brutal violence.

   Reg enters into a relationship with Frances, his driver's sister, whom
   he eventually marries. When he is imprisoned for a previous criminal
   conviction, which he cannot evade, she makes him swear that he will
   leave his criminal life behind, an oath he never honours owing to the
   allure of crime. While Reg is in prison, Ron's mental instability and
   violent temperament lead to severe financial setbacks at the nightclub,
   and it is almost forced to close after Ron scares away most of the
   customers. On the first night after Reg's release from prison, the
   brothers have an all-out fist fight, but they manage to patch things
   up, at least partially.

   The brothers are approached by Angelo Bruno of the Philadelphia crime
   family who, on behalf of Meyer Lansky and the American Mafia, wants to
   engage them in a crime-syndicate deal. Bruno agrees to a fifty-fifty
   deal with Reg to split London's underground gambling profits in
   exchange for local protection by the brothers. Initially, this system
   is highly lucrative for the Kray brothers; however, Ron's paranoia and
   inclination towards violence causes problems for Reg's efforts to
   maintain control. Ron's barely concealed volatility results in him
   publicly murdering George Cornell, an associate of the Torture Gang. As
   a result, Scotland Yard opens a full investigation of the Kray
   brothers.

   Reg's marriage with Frances crumbles owing to his addiction to crime.
   Unable to bear Reg's false promises to reform, Frances starts consuming
   prescription drugs illegally. After he beats and rapes her in a fit of
   rage, she leaves him. When Reg approaches her to reconcile, Frances
   seems to agree and they plan to visit Ibiza, but she kills herself with
   a drug overdose, leaving Reg ridden with guilt. The twins' criminal
   activities continue, and Ron pays petty criminal Jack "the Hat" McVitie
   to kill Leslie Payne, Reg's partner, who controls the legal side of the
   Krays' operations, as he does not trust Payne. Jack only wounds Payne,
   who then turns the brothers over to Detective Superintendent Leonard
   "Nipper" Read, the head of the investigation. Reg finds out and
   brutally stabs McVitie with a knife during a party hosted by Ron. The
   testimony given by Payne means that Ron is arrested and charged with
   Cornell's murder. The final scene shows a police squad breaking down
   the door to Reggie's flat in order to apprehend him for McVitie's
   murder.

   The closing captions indicate both brothers receiving criminal
   convictions for murder. They died five years apart, Ron from a heart
   attack in 1995, and Reggie from bladder cancer in 2000.

Production

   [edit]

Development

   [edit]

   On 12 October 2013, it was announced that Brian Helgeland had written a
   script and would be directing a film focusing on the life of Reggie
   Kray who, with identical brother Ronald, formed the notorious Kray
   twins. Helgeland said the film would concentrate on Reggie's attempts
   to control the psychopathic tendencies of his younger twin.

   Helgeland spoke of hanging out in London with well-known Krays
   associate Freddie Foreman, saying, "I had drinks with him in his local
   haunt. When we finished he got up to go and they feted him at the bar.
   I said to him, 'what about the bill?' and he replied, 'we don't
   pay.'"^[10]

   Helgeland attended the Cannes Film Festival with Working Title's Tim
   Bevan and Chris Clark to talk to potential buyers of the film and
   showing test footage of Hardy playing the twins.^[11]^[12]

Casting

   [edit]

   On 18 April 2014, it was announced that Helgeland would write and
   direct the film, with the shooting being based in the United Kingdom
   and with Hardy starring as the male leads.^[13] Five days later, it was
   stated that Browning was in negotiations for a role as the film's
   female lead.^[14] Hardy was so set on playing Ronnie Kray that he
   proposed to Helgeland that if he gave him the role of Ronnie, Hardy
   would play the role of Reggie for free.

Filming

   [edit]

   Crews and cast were spotted filming scenes at Falmouth Road, London, St
   Anne's Limehouse in Limehouse^[15] and in the Windmill Walk area around
   London Waterloo.^[16] Filming also took place in Caradoc Street in
   Greenwich, in the Cedra Estate on Cazenove Road and in Gibson Gardens,
   both of which are in Hackney.

   Principal photography started on 12 June 2014.^[11]^[17]

Release

   [edit]

   Financing for Legend was provided by StudioCanal, which also
   distributed in the United Kingdom, France, New Zealand and Germany in
   addition to handling international sales, which started at the
   beginning of the Cannes Film Festival.^[18] On 30 April 2014, Cross
   Creek Pictures acquired the North American distribution rights to
   Legend from StudioCanal, with a planned 2015 theatrical release through
   Universal Pictures in its distribution deal with the studio.^[19]^[20]
   Sales to other territories such as Asia, Africa and much of Europe are
   being completed.^[21] The film was originally set for release in the US
   on 2 October 2015, but it was moved to 20 November 2015.^[22]

   Legend premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 12
   September 2015 at Roy Thomson Hall.^[citation needed]

Marketing

   [edit]

   On 13 June 2014, the first image of the film was published, featuring
   Hardy as the Kray twins.^[6]^[23] A promotional poster attracted
   publicity because it made a two-star review from The Guardian appear to
   be at least a four-star review by placing the two stars between the
   heads of the Krays.^[24]^[25]

Home media

   [edit]

   Legend was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on 25
   January 2016 and in the United States on 1 March 2016.^[26]

Reception

   [edit]

Critical reception

   [edit]

   On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 60% of 171 critics'
   reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The website's
   consensus reads: "As a gangster biopic, Legend is deeply flawed, but as
   a showcase for Tom Hardy—in a dual role, no less—it just about lives up
   to its title."^[27] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned
   the film a score of 55 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating
   "mixed or average" reviews.^[28]

Box office

   [edit]

   Legend grossed US$28.0 million in the United Kingdom, and marked seven
   weeks in the Top 10 at the British box office.^[29] In addition, it
   grossed $1.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $13.1 million
   in other territories, for a worldwide total of $43.0 million,^[29]
   against a budget shy of $25 million.^[30]
