   Spin-offs List of spin-offs

   The Legend of Zelda^[a] is a media franchise created by the Japanese
   game designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka. It is primarily
   developed and published by Nintendo; some portable installments and
   re-releases have been outsourced to Flagship, Vanpool, Grezzo, and
   Tantalus Media.

   The series centers on the various incarnations of Link, a courageous
   young man of the elf-like Hylian race, and Princess Zelda, a princess
   within the bloodline of the goddess Hylia, as they fight to save the
   land of Hyrule from Ganon, an evil warlord turned demon king, who is
   the principal antagonist of the series. Ganon wishes to use the
   Triforce, a sacred relic left behind by the three goddesses that
   created Hyrule, to remake the world in his own dark image. When
   gathered together, the power of the Triforce can grant any wish its
   user desires, but if someone with a heart that does not possess a
   balance of the three virtues of Power, Courage, and Wisdom attempts to
   touch the Triforce, it will split into three triangles and bond with
   three people whose hearts embody the required virtue.

   Although their personalities and backstory differ from game to game,
   the incarnations of Link and Zelda often have many traits in common,
   such as Link often being left-handed and clad in green, and Zelda being
   associated with wisdom, light, and prophecy. While the conflict with
   Ganon serves as a backbone for the series, some games have featured
   other settings and antagonists, with Link traveling or being sent to
   these other lands in their time of need.

   Since The Legend of Zelda was released in 1986, the series has expanded
   to include 21 entries on all of Nintendo's major game consoles, as well
   as a number of spin-offs. An American animated TV series based on the
   games aired in 1989 and manga adaptations commissioned by Nintendo have
   been produced in Japan since 1997. The Legend of Zelda is one of
   Nintendo's most successful franchises; several of its entries are
   considered among the greatest video games of all time.

Gameplay

   [220px-Rubin_BotW_20220409_RGBA8.png] Rupees, the fictional currency in
   the series

   Gameplay of The Legend of Zelda games feature a mix of puzzles,
   action-adventure, and exploration. These elements have remained
   constant throughout the series, with refinements and additions featured
   in each new game. Later games in the series include stealth gameplay,
   where the player must avoid enemies while proceeding through a level,
   as well as racing elements. Although the games can be beaten with a
   minimal amount of exploration and side quests, the player is frequently
   rewarded with helpful items or increased abilities for solving puzzles
   or exploring hidden areas. Some items are consistent and appear many
   times throughout the series (such as bombs and bomb flowers, which can
   be used both as weapons and to open blocked or hidden doorways;
   boomerangs, which can kill or paralyze enemies; keys for locked doors;
   magic swords, shields, and bows and arrows), while others are unique to
   a single game. Though the games contain role-playing elements (Zelda
   II: The Adventure of Link is the only one to include an experience
   system), they emphasize straightforward hack-and-slash-style combat
   over the strategic, turn-based or active time combat of series like
   Final Fantasy. The game's role-playing elements, however, have led to
   much debate over whether or not the Zelda games should be classified as
   action role-playing games, a genre on which the series has had a strong
   influence.^[1] Miyamoto himself disagreed with the role-playing label,
   and classified Zelda as "a real-time adventure game"; he said that he
   was "not interested in systems where everything in the game is decided
   by stats and numbers" but wanted "to preserve as much of that "live"
   feeling as possible", and felt that action games are better suited to
   convey to players.^[2]
   [220px-Zelda_clone_mockups.png] The Legend of Zelda often includes
   nonlinear gameplay and varying environments in an explorable world,
   similar to this illustration.

   Every game in the main Zelda series has consisted of three principal
   areas: an overworld which connects all other areas, in which movement
   is multidirectional, allowing the player some degree of freedom of
   action; areas of interaction with other characters (merely caves or
   hidden rooms in the first game, but expanding to entire towns and
   cities in subsequent games) in which the player gains special items or
   advice, can purchase equipment or complete side quests; and dungeons,
   areas of labyrinthine layout, usually underground, comprising a wide
   range of difficult enemies, bosses, and items. Each dungeon usually has
   one major item inside, which can be essential for solving many of the
   puzzles within that dungeon and often plays a crucial role in defeating
   that dungeon's boss, as well as progressing through the game. In nearly
   every Zelda game, navigating a dungeon is aided by locating a map,
   which reveals its layout, and a magic compass, which reveals the
   location of significant and smaller items such as keys and equipment.
   In later games, the dungeon includes a special "big key" that will
   unlock the door to battle the dungeon's boss enemy and open the item
   chest.

   In most Zelda games, the player's HP or life meter is represented by a
   line of hearts, each heart typically representing two hit points. At
   the start of the game the player only has three hearts; players can
   increase their max hearts by finding heart-shaped crystals called
   "Heart Containers". Full heart containers are usually received at the
   end of dungeons and dropped by dungeon bosses. Smaller "Pieces of
   Heart" are awarded for completing side quests or found hidden around
   the game world in various places, and require a certain number (usually
   four) to form a full heart container. Health can be replenished by
   picking up hearts left by defeated enemies or destroyed objects,
   consuming items such as potions or food, or going to a Great Fairy
   Fountain to have the Great Fairy heal Link completely. Occasionally the
   player will find fairies hidden in specific locations; these fairies
   can either heal Link immediately or be kept in empty bottles, and will
   revive the player the next time they die.

   The games pioneered a number of features that were to become industry
   standards. The original Legend of Zelda was the first console game with
   a save function that enabled players to stop playing and then resume
   later. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time introduced a targeting
   system that let the player lock the camera on to enemy or friendly
   non-player characters which simplified 3D combat.^[citation needed]

Inspiration

   [110px-Shigeru_Miyamoto_GDC_2007.jpg] Shigeru Miyamoto, series creator,
   was inspired by the hillsides, forests, and caves surrounding his
   childhood home in Sonobe, Japan.

   The Legend of Zelda was principally inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto's
   "explorations" as a young boy in the hillsides, forests, and caves
   surrounding his childhood home in Sonobe, Japan where he ventured into
   forests with secluded lakes, caves, and rural villages. According to
   Miyamoto, one of his most memorable experiences was the discovery of a
   cave entrance in the middle of the woods.^[3] After some hesitation, he
   apprehensively entered the cave, and explored its depths with the aid
   of a lantern. Miyamoto has referred to the creation of the Zelda games
   as an attempt to bring to life a "miniature garden" for players to play
   with in each game of the series.^[4]

   The story and setting were developed by Takashi Tezuka. Seeking to
   create a fairytale adventure game, Tezuka drew inspirations from
   fantasy books such as J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the
   Rings.^[5]^[6]^[7] According to Keiji Terui, who wrote the backstory in
   the first game's manual, the location named Death Mountain was
   initially a working title for the legend of the Triforce which was
   written with inspirations from the battles of medieval Europe.^[8]^[9]
   The Master Sword was introduced as Excalibur in the French version of A
   Link to the Past,^[10]^[11] which is regarded as reminiscent to the
   legend of King Arthur.^[12]^[7] Celtic mythology inspired the name of
   Link's steed, Epona, based on Epona, Celtic goddess of
   fertility.^[13]^[14]

   Hearing of American novelist, socialite and painter Zelda Fitzgerald,
   Miyamoto thought the name sounded "pleasant and significant".^[15]
   Paying tribute, he chose to name the princess after her, and titled it
   The Legend of Zelda. Link and the fairy were inspired by Peter Pan and
   Tinker Bell.^[16]^[17] When the series made the transition to 3D, the
   combat system of Ocarina of Time was based on the chanbara (samurai)
   style of Japanese sword fighting.^[18]

Audio

   [110px-Koji_Kondo_-_GDC_2007_cropped.jpg] Koji Kondo, the series's
   original composer

   Games in The Legend of Zelda series frequently feature in-game musical
   instruments, particularly in musical puzzles, which are
   widespread.^[19] Often, instruments trigger game events: for example,
   the recorder in The Legend of Zelda can reveal secret areas, as well as
   warp Link to the dungeon entrances. This warping with music feature has
   also been used in A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening. In Ocarina
   of Time, playing instruments is a core part of the game, with the
   player needing to play the instrument through the use of the game
   controller to succeed.^[20] Ocarina of Time is "[one of the] first
   contemporary non-dance title[s] to feature music-making as part of its
   gameplay",^[21] using music as a heuristic device and requiring the
   player to utilise songs to progress in the game^[22] – a game mechanic
   that is also present in Majora's Mask.^[23]

   "The Legend of Zelda Theme" is a recurring piece of music that was
   created for the first game. The composer and sound director of the
   series, Koji Kondo, initially planned to use Maurice Ravel's Boléro as
   the game's title theme, but was forced to change it when he learned,
   late in the game's development cycle, that the copyright for the
   orchestral piece had not yet expired. As a result, Kondo wrote a new
   arrangement of the overworld theme within one day.^[24]

   Up until Breath of the Wild, the Legend of Zelda series avoided using
   voice acting in speaking roles, relying instead on written dialogue.
   Series producer Eiji Aonuma previously stated that as Link is entirely
   mute, having the other characters speak while Link remains silent
   "would be off-putting".^[25] Instead of theme music for different
   locations, Breath of the Wild plays natural ambience around the player
   as main sounds, in addition to some minimalist piano music.^[26]

Setting

   Main article: Universe of The Legend of Zelda

   Maps of Hyrule
   Map of Hyrule, as seen in Ocarina of Time
   Map of Hyrule, as seen in Breath of the Wild (legend in Spanish)

   The Legend of Zelda takes place predominantly in a medieval Western
   Europe-inspired fantasy world called Hyrule,^[27]^[28] which has
   developed a deep history and wide geography over the series's many
   releases. Much of the backstory of the creation of Hyrule was revealed
   in the games A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, The Wind Waker,
   Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword, and A Link Between Worlds. Hyrule's
   principal inhabitants are pointy-eared, elf-like humanoids called
   Hylians, which include the player character, Link, and the eponymous
   princess, Zelda.

   The fictional universe established by the Zelda games sets the stage
   for each adventure. Some games take place in different lands with their
   own back-stories. Hytopia is a connected kingdom,^[29] Labrynna and
   Holodrum are different countries separate from the Kingdom of Hyrule,
   Termina and Lorule serve as parallel worlds,^[30] and Koholint is an
   island far away from Hyrule that appears to be part of a dream.^[31]

Story

   [220px-Trifuerza.svg.png] The Triforce is represented as three
   conjoined golden triangles.

   According to the in-game backstories, the world of Hyrule was created
   by the three golden goddesses: Din, Farore, and Nayru.^[32] Before
   departing, the goddesses left a sacred artifact called the Triforce,
   which could grant powers to the user. It physically manifests itself as
   three golden triangles in which each embodies one of the goddesses'
   virtues: Power, Courage, and Wisdom.^[33] However, because the Triforce
   has no will of its own and it can not judge between good and evil, it
   will grant any wish indiscriminately.^[34]^[35] Because of this, it was
   placed within an alternate world called the "Sacred Realm" or the
   "Golden Land" until one worthy of its power and has balanced virtues of
   Power, Wisdom, and Courage in their heart could obtain it, in its
   entirety. If a person is not of a balanced heart, the triforce part
   that the user mostly believes in will stay with that person and the
   remainder will seek out others. In order to master and control the
   triforce as a whole, the user must get the other parts found in other
   individuals and bring them together to reunite them. The Sacred Realm
   can itself be affected by the heart of those who enter it: those who
   are pure will make it a paradise, while those who are evil will
   transform it into a dark realm.^[36]

   In Skyward Sword, the Triforce was sought by the Demon King
   Demise,^[37] an eternal being that had conquered time itself.^[38]
   After a long battle against the goddess Hylia, guardian of the
   Triforce, Demise was sealed away within her temple.^[33]^[39] Hylia,
   placing the Hylians on a floating island in the sky called Skyloft to
   protect them, orchestrated a means to stop the demon from escaping:
   creating the Goddess Sword (later becoming the Master Sword) for her
   chosen hero^[40] and discarding her divinity to be reborn among the
   people of Skyloft.^[41] In time, Zelda and Link (the reborn Hylia and
   her predestined warrior) enacted the goddess's plan and Demise was
   destroyed, but he vowed that his rage would be reborn and forever
   plague those descended from Link and Zelda.^[42] Following the
   establishment of Hyrule Kingdom, Demise's prophecy came to fruition in
   Ocarina of Time, when Ganondorf's attempt to get the Triforce scattered
   it with him gaining the Triforce of Power. The Triforce of Wisdom ended
   up with the Hylian princesses descended from Zelda, each named after
   her, while the Triforce of Courage is passed to a youth named Link
   across generations. While the Triforces of Power and Wisdom have been
   part of the series since the original The Legend of Zelda, it was in
   Zelda II: The Adventure of Link that the Triforce of Courage was
   introduced, being obtained by Link at the end of his quest. The
   Triforce, or even a piece of it, is not always distributed as a whole.
   Such as in The Wind Waker, Link must find all the pieces (called
   Triforce Shards) of the Triforce of Courage before he can return to
   Hyrule. Even in the original The Legend of Zelda, Zelda breaks her
   Triforce of Wisdom into 8 pieces for Link to find, before she was
   captured by Ganon.

   The chronology of the Legend of Zelda series was a subject of much
   debate among fans until an official timeline was released within the
   Hyrule Historia collector's book, first released in Japan in December
   2011.^[45]^[46] Prior to its release, in a 2003 interview, series
   creator Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed the existence of an internal
   document which connected all the games, with series producer Eiji
   Aonuma later revealing in 2010 the confidential nature of this
   document, which only Miyamoto himself and the director of each game had
   access to.^[47]^[48]

   In-game content, marketing material, and developer statements once
   partially established a timeline of the released installments: the
   original The Legend of Zelda was followed by Zelda II: The Adventure of
   Link as a direct sequel, which takes place several years
   later;^[49]^[50] A Link to the Past is a prequel to the previous two
   games,^[51]^[52]^[53] and is followed by Link's Awakening;^[54]^[55]
   Ocarina of Time is a prequel to A Link to the Past and takes the story
   many centuries back - according to character designer Satoru Takizawa,
   it was meant to implicitly tell the story of the Imprisoning
   War,^[56]^[57] and was followed by Majora's Mask as a direct sequel,
   set a few months later;^[58] Four Swords, upon its release, was
   considered the oldest tale in the series's chronology, predating
   Ocarina of Time;^[59] The Wind Waker takes place in one of the parallel
   timelines that emerged from Ocarina of Time, more than a century later,
   in the "adult era";^[60]^[61] Four Swords Adventures, upon its release,
   was considered to be a direct sequel to Four Swords, set sometime after
   its events;^[59] The Minish Cap is a prequel to Four Swords, telling of
   the origins of villain Vaati and the creation of the Four Sword;^[62]
   Twilight Princess takes place in another of the parallel timelines that
   emerged from Ocarina of Time, more than a century later, in the "child
   era";^[60]^[61] Phantom Hourglass is a direct sequel to The Wind
   Waker,^[63] and is followed by Spirit Tracks, which is set about a
   century later on a land far away from the setting of The Wind
   Waker.^[64] Skyward Sword precedes The Minish Cap, telling the story of
   the creation of the Master Sword.^[65]^[66] A Link Between Worlds takes
   place six generations after A Link to the Past, and features the
   Triforce being reunited, and Ganon being resurrected;^[67] Tri Force
   Heroes is a direct sequel to A Link Between Worlds, which takes place
   several years later;^[68]^[69] Breath of the Wild and its direct
   sequel, Tears of the Kingdom take place after all previous games in the
   series, without specifying a direct connection to any of the three
   timeline branches.^[44]

   In the early 2000s, Nintendo of America released a timeline on the
   official website of the series as one of the possible interpretation of
   the events from all entries released up to that point, featuring a
   single protagonist named Link, the "Hero of Time" from its first
   adventure in Ocarina of Time. It was followed by Majora's Mask, A Link
   to the Past, Oracle of Seasons, Oracle of Ages, the original The Legend
   of Zelda, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, and finally Link's
   Awakening.^[70] In 2011, series translator Daniel Owsen revealed that,
   at one point, his coworkers at Nintendo of America and him conceived
   another complete timeline and intended to make it available online, but
   the Japanese series developers rejected the idea so that the placement
   of each game would be kept open to the imagination of the players.^[71]

   On December 21, 2011, to celebrate 25th anniversary of the series, the
   Hyrule Historia art book was published by Shogakukan, which contained
   an official timeline of the fictional chronology of the series up to
   that point.^[45] This timeline subsequently posits that following
   Ocarina of Time, it splits into three alternate routes: in one, Ganon
   is not defeated, leading into the Imprisoning War and A Link to the
   Past, Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages, Link's Awakening (A Link
   Between Worlds, Tri Force Heroes, and Echoes of Wisdom were released
   after the timeline), The Legend of Zelda and The Adventure of Link. The
   second and third, where Ganon is defeated by Link, lead to a split
   timeline between his childhood (where Zelda sends him back in time so
   he can use the wisdom he has gained to warn young Zelda of the
   horrifying fate of Hyrule) and adulthood (where adult Zelda lives on to
   try and rebuild her kingdom). His childhood continues with Majora's
   Mask, followed by Twilight Princess and Four Swords Adventures. The
   timeline from his adult life continues into Wind Waker, Phantom
   Hourglass and Spirit Tracks.^[45]

   In 2018, Nintendo revealed Breath of the Wild's timeline placement
   after all previous games in the series, without specifying a connection
   to any of the three timeline branches. Aonuma and Breath of the Wild
   director Hidemaro Fujibayashi justified the vague placement with the
   previous idea of keeping it open to players' imaginations.^[44]
   Nintendo moved Link's Awakening to take place before Oracle of Seasons
   and Oracle of Ages.^[44] In 2020, Nintendo released Hyrule Warriors:
   Age of Calamity, a gameplay-wise sequel to the 2014 spin-off game
   Hyrule Warriors marketed as a prequel to Breath of the Wild, being set
   100 years before,^[72] but the events of Age of Calamity diverged from
   the backstory established in Breath of the Wild, creating an alternate
   timeline separate from it.^[73]

Characters

   Main article: Characters of The Legend of Zelda

Link

   Main article: Link (The Legend of Zelda)

   The central protagonist of The Legend of Zelda series, Link is the name
   of various young male Hylians who characteristically wear a green tunic
   and a pointed cap, and are the bearers of the Triforce of Courage. In
   most games, the player can give Link a different name before the start
   of the adventure, and he will be referred by that given name throughout
   by the non-player characters (NPCs). Miyamoto said in a 2002 interview
   that he named the protagonist "Link" because the character is/was
   supposed to be the "link" between the player and the game world. The
   various Links each have a special title, such as "Hero of Time", "Hero
   of Winds" or "Hero of the Wild". Like many silent protagonists in video
   games, Link does not speak, only producing grunts, yells, etc., but he
   is not mute - dialogue from him is referenced second-hand by in-game
   characters, despite not being seen or heard by the player. Link is
   depicted as a silent protagonist so that the audience is able to have
   their own thoughts as to how their Link would answer the characters
   instead of him having scripted responses.

Princess Zelda

   Main article: Princess Zelda

   Princess Zelda is the princess of Hyrule and the guardian of the
   Triforce of Wisdom. Her name is present in many of her female ancestors
   and descendants. While most games require Link to save Zelda from
   Ganon, she sometimes plays a supporting role in battle, using magical
   powers and weapons such as Light Arrows to aid Link. With the exception
   of the CD-i games, she was not playable in the main series until Spirit
   Tracks, where she becomes a spirit and can possess a Phantom Knight
   that can be controlled by the player. Zelda appears under various other
   aliases and alter egos, including Sheik (in Ocarina of Time) and Tetra
   (in The Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass). In Skyward Sword, it is
   revealed that the Zelda of that game is a reincarnation of the goddess
   Hylia, whose power flows through the royal bloodline. The name "Zelda"
   derives from the American novelist Zelda Fitzgerald.^[74]

Ganon

   Main article: Ganon

   Ganon, also known as Ganondorf in his humanoid form, is the main
   antagonist and the final boss in the majority of The Legend of Zelda
   games. In the series, Ganondorf is the leader of a race of desert
   brigands called the Gerudo, which consists entirely of female warriors
   save for one man born every one hundred years. He is significantly
   taller than other human NPCs, but his looks vary between games, often
   taking the form of a monstrous anthropomorphic boar. His specific
   motives vary from game to game, but most often his plans include him
   kidnapping Princess Zelda and planning to achieve domination of Hyrule
   and presumably the world beyond it. To this end, he seeks the Triforce,
   a powerful magical relic. He often possesses a portion of the Triforce
   called the Triforce of Power, which gives him great strength, but it is
   often not enough to accomplish his ends, leading him to hunt the
   remaining Triforce pieces. Unlike Link, Zelda, and most other recurring
   characters, he is actually the same person in every game, with the
   exception of Four Swords Adventures, where he is a reincarnation of the
   original. In each game the battles with him are different and he fights
   using different styles. The game Skyward Sword indicates that Ganon is
   a reincarnation of an evil deity known as Demise.

1986–1997: 2D origins

   An overhead view of a young boy in a green tunic battling creatures.
   The Legend of Zelda, released in 1986 for the Nintendo Entertainment
   System, was the first game in the series - it featured an open world,
   and nonlinear gameplay.

   The Legend of Zelda, the first game of the series, was first released
   in Japan in February 1986, on the Famicom Disk System.^[75] A cartridge
   version for the Nintendo Entertainment System, using battery-backed
   memory, was released in 1987 in the United States on August 22, and in
   Europe on November 27. The game features a "Second Quest", accessible
   either upon completing the game, or by registering one's name as
   "ZELDA" when starting a new quest. The "Second Quest" features
   different dungeons and item placement, and more difficult enemies.^[76]
   A modified version of the original Famicom game, BS Zelda no Densetsu,
   was released for the Super Famicom's satellite-based expansion,
   Satellaview, in August 1995, in Japan. A second Satellaview game, BS
   Zelda no Densetsu MAP2 was released for the Satellaview in December the
   same year. Both games featured rearranged dungeons, an altered
   overworld, and new voice-acted plot-lines.^[77]

   The second game, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, was released for the
   Famicom Disk System in Japan in January 1987,^[75] and for the Nintendo
   Entertainment System in Europe in September and North America in
   December 1988. The game exchanged the top-down perspective for
   side-scrolling (though the top-down point of view was retained for
   overworld areas), and introduced RPG elements (such as experience
   points) not used previously or thereafter in the series. The Legend of
   Zelda and Zelda II were released in gold-colored cartridges instead of
   the console's regular grey cartridges. Both were re-released in the
   final years of the Nintendo Entertainment System with grey
   cartridges.^[78]

   Four years later, A Link to the Past returned to the top-down view
   (under a 3/4 perspective), and added the concept of an alternate
   dimension, the Dark World. The game was released for the Super NES in
   November 1991.^[75] A downloadable version of A Link to the Past^[79]
   and an exclusive modified version called BS Zelda no Densetsu Inishie
   no Sekiban^[80] were released on the Satellaview in Japan in March
   1997. A Link to the Past was re-released for the Game Boy Advance in
   2002. The SNES version was later re-released on the Wii Virtual Console
   in January 2007, on the Wii U Virtual Console, and on Nintendo Switch
   Online.

   Three Zelda-themed LCD games were created between 1989 and 1992. The
   Zelda version of Nintendo's Game & Watch series was released first in
   August 1989 as a dual-screen handheld electronic game similar in
   appearance to today's Nintendo DS. It was re-released in 1998 as a
   Toymax, Inc. Mini Classic and was later included as an unlockable extra
   in Game & Watch Gallery 4, a 2002 compilation for the Game Boy Advance.
   While the Game & Watch Zelda was developed in-house by Nintendo, the
   subsequent two LCD games were developed by third parties under license
   by Nintendo. In October 1989, The Legend of Zelda was developed by
   Nelsonic as part of its Game Watch line. This game was an actual
   digital watch with primitive gameplay based on the original Legend of
   Zelda. In 1992, Epoch Co. developed Zelda no Densetsu: Kamigami no
   Triforce for its Barcode Battler II console. The game employed
   card-scanning technology similar to the later-released Nintendo
   e-Reader.

   The next game, Link's Awakening, for Nintendo's Game Boy, is the first
   Zelda for a handheld, and the first set outside Hyrule and to exclude
   Princess Zelda. Link's Awakening was re-released, in full color, as a
   launch game for the Game Boy Color in 1998 as Link's Awakening DX. This
   remaster features additions such as an extra color-based dungeon and a
   photo shop that allows interaction with the Game Boy Printer. Link's
   Awakening DX was released on the 3DS' Virtual Console in June 2011. An
   HD remake of Link's Awakening was released for the Nintendo Switch in
   2019.^[81]^[82]

   Three video games were developed and released on CD-i in the early
   1990s as a product of a compromise between Philips and Nintendo, after
   the companies failed to develop a CD-ROM peripheral for the Super NES.
   Created independently with no observation by or influence from
   Nintendo, the games are Link: The Faces of Evil, Zelda: The Wand of
   Gamelon, and later, Zelda's Adventure. Nintendo never acknowledged them
   in the Zelda timeline, and they are considered to be in a separate,
   self-contained canon. These games are widely acknowledged to be the
   worst installments in the series, though have since gained a cult
   following in the form of internet memes.^[83]

1998–2001: Transition to 3D

   The child version of the game's protagonist, Link, stands in Hyrule
   field wearing his distinctive green tunic and pointed cap. In each
   corner of the screen are icons that display information to the player.
   In the upper left-hand corner, there are hearts, which represent Link's
   health, in the lower left-hand corner is a counter that displays the
   number of Rupees (the in-game currency) possessed by the player. There
   is a mini-map in the lower right-hand corner, and five icons in the
   upper right-hand corner, one green, one red, and three yellow, which
   represent the actions available to the player on the corresponding
   buttons of the N64 controller. Ocarina of Time, released in 1998 for
   the Nintendo 64, was the first 3D game in the series.

   After five years without a new game, the series made the transition to
   3D with Ocarina of Time for the Nintendo 64, which was released in
   November 1998. This game, initially known as Zelda 64, retains the core
   gameplay of the previous 2D games, and was very successful commercially
   and critically, considered by many critics and gamers to be the best
   video game of all time, and ranking highly on IGN and EGM's "greatest
   games of all time" lists, as well as scoring perfect scores in several
   video game publications.^[84] In February 2006, it was ranked by
   Nintendo Power as the best game released for a Nintendo console.^[85]
   The game was originally developed for the poorly selling, Japanese-only
   64DD, but was converted to cartridge format when the 64DD hardware was
   delayed.^[86] A new gameplay mechanic, lock-on targeting, is used in
   the game, which focuses the camera on a nearby target and alters the
   player's actions relative to that target.^[87] Such mechanics allow
   precise sword fighting in a 3D space. The game heavily uses
   context-sensitive button play, which enabled the player to control
   various actions with Link using only one button on the Nintendo 64's
   controller. Each action was handled slightly differently but all used
   the 'A' button to perform. For instance, standing next to a block and
   pressing 'A' made Link grab it (enabling him to push/pull it), but
   moving forwards into a block and pressing 'A' allowed Link to climb the
   block. The game featured the first appearance of Link's horse, Epona,
   allowing Link to travel quickly across land and fire arrows from
   horseback. Those who preordered the game received a gold-colored
   cartridge in a limited edition box with a golden plastic card affixed,
   reading "Collector's Edition".^[88] In some stores that had this
   "Collector's Edition" quickly sell out, a small and rare Zelda pin was
   given instead. It is the sword and shield emblem with "Zelda" written
   on it. Very few of them are known to remain. Ocarina of Time was
   re-released on the GameCube in 2002, when it was offered as a pre-order
   incentive for The Wind Waker in the U.S., Canada and Japan.^[89] It
   includes the cancelled 64DD expansion for Ocarina of Time known as Ura
   Zelda during development. Named Ocarina of Time Master Quest, the game
   was given reorganized dungeon layouts for greater difficulty.^[89]^[90]
   Europe continued to receive this "Two-Game Bonus Disc" free in every
   copy of The Wind Waker, except for the discounted Player's Choice
   version. Ocarina of Time was available through the Wii's Virtual
   Console service.^[91] Nintendo re-released it for the Wii U Virtual
   Console in July 2015. Ocarina of Time 3D for the 3DS, featuring remade
   graphics and stereoscopic 3D, was released in mid-June 2011. Ocarina of
   Time has been made available on the higher tier of Nintendo Switch
   Online in HD resolution.

   Ocarina of Time's follow-up, Majora's Mask, was released in April 2000.
   It uses the same 3D game engine as the previous game,^[92] and added a
   time-based concept, in which Link, the protagonist, relives the events
   of three days as many times as needed to complete the game's
   objectives. It was originally called Zelda Gaiden,^[93] a Japanese
   title that translates as Zelda Side story. Gameplay changed
   significantly; in addition to the time-limit, Link can use masks to
   transform into creatures with unique abilities. While Majora's Mask
   retains the graphical style of Ocarina of Time, it is also a departure,
   particularly in its atmosphere. It features motion-blur, unlike its
   predecessor. The game is darker in tone,^[92] dealing with death and
   tragedy in a manner not previously seen in the series, and has a sense
   of impending doom, as a large moon slowly descends upon the land of
   Termina to destroy all life. All copies of Majora's Mask are gold
   cartridges. A limited "Collector's Edition" lenticular cartridge label
   was offered as the pre-order incentive. Copies of the game that are not
   collector's editions feature a normal sticker cartridge label. Majora's
   Mask was available on the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console catalogues. The
   Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D was released for 3DS in North
   America, Europe, Japan, and Australia in February 2015. The Nintendo 64
   version was added to Nintendo Switch Online in February 2022; with
   this, all of the 3D games in the series have been re-released in HD
   resolution.

   Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages were released simultaneously for
   the Game Boy Color in 2001, and interact using passwords^[94] or a Game
   Link Cable.^[95] After one game has been completed, the player is given
   a password that allows the other game to be played as a sequel.^[94]
   They were developed by Flagship in conjunction with Nintendo, with
   supervision from Miyamoto. After the team experimented with porting the
   original The Legend of Zelda to the Game Boy Color, they decided to
   make an original trilogy^[96] to be called the "Triforce Series".^[97]
   When the password system linking the three games proved too
   troublesome, the concept was reduced to two games at Miyamoto's
   suggestion.^[98] These two games became Oracle of Ages, which is more
   puzzle-based, and Oracle of Seasons, which is more
   action-oriented.^[99] Both titles were later released on the 3DS
   Virtual Console and Nintendo Switch Online.

2002–2005: Introduction of Toon Link and multiplayer

   [220px-The_Legend_of_Zelda_Four_Swords_screenshot.png] Four Swords,
   released in 2002 for the Game Boy Advance, was the first multiplayer
   game in the series, and introduced a new cartoon art style.

   The Game Boy Advance release of A Link to the Past in 2002 featured a
   new game, Four Swords,^[75] the first multiplayer Zelda. This game
   introduced Toon Link, a name first used in Super Smash Bros. Brawl to
   refer to cartoon-based visual designs of Link. Four Swords Anniversary
   Edition^[100] was released in September 2011, as free DSiWare available
   until February 20, 2012.
   [220px-The_Legend_of_Zelda_The_Wind_Waker_screenshot.jpg] The Wind
   Waker, released in 2002 for the GameCube, was the first game in the
   series featuring cel shading.

   When Nintendo revealed the GameCube on August 24, 2000, the day before
   Nintendo's Space World 2000 exposition,^[101] a software demonstration
   showed a realistically styled real-time duel between Ganondorf and
   Link. Fans and the media speculated that the battle might be from a
   Zelda game in development at the time.^[102] At Space World 2001,
   Nintendo showed a cel-shaded Zelda game, later released as The Wind
   Waker in December 2002. Due to poor reception, nothing further was
   shown until a playable demonstration was ready. Miyamoto felt The Wind
   Waker would "extend Zelda's reach to all ages".^[103]^[104] The
   gameplay centers on controlling wind with a baton called the "Wind
   Waker" and sailing a small boat around an island-filled ocean,
   retaining similar gameplay mechanics as the previous 3D games in the
   series. The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition, released for the
   GameCube in 2003,^[105] included the original The Legend of Zelda,
   Zelda II, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, and a demo of The Wind Waker.
   The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD was released for Wii U in 2013.

   Four Swords Adventures was released for the GameCube in early 2004 in
   Japan and America, and January 2005 in Europe. Based on the handheld
   Four Swords, Four Swords Adventures was another deviation from previous
   Zelda gameplay, focusing on level-based and multiplayer gameplay. The
   game contains 24 levels and a map screen; there is no connecting
   overworld. For multiplayer features, each player must use a Game Boy
   Advance system linked to the GameCube via a Nintendo GameCube – Game
   Boy Advance link cable. The game features a single-player campaign, in
   which using a Game Boy Advance is optional. Four Swords Adventures
   includes two gameplay modes: "Hyrulean Adventure", with a plot and
   gameplay similar to other Zelda games, and "Shadow Battle", in which
   multiple Links, played by multiple players, battle each other. The
   Japanese and Korean versions include an exclusive third segment, "Navi
   Trackers" (originally designed as the stand-alone game "Tetra's
   Trackers"), which contains spoken dialogue for most of the characters,
   unlike other games in The Legend of Zelda series.

   In November 2004 in Japan and Europe, and January 2005 in America,
   Nintendo released The Minish Cap for the Game Boy Advance. In The
   Minish Cap Link can shrink in size using a mystical, sentient hat named
   Ezlo. While shrunk, he can see previously explored parts of a dungeon
   from a different perspective, and enter areas through
   otherwise-impassable openings. It was later released on the Wii U
   Virtual Console.

2006–2011: Motion and touch-based swordplay

   A boy in a green tunic holds a shield while swinging his sword towards
   an enemy. Twilight Princess was the first game in the series with
   motion controls, in which the player controls Link's sword using the
   Wii Remote (GameCube version pictured).

   In November 2006, Twilight Princess was released as the first Zelda
   game on the Wii, and later in December as the last Nintendo-published
   game for the GameCube, the console for which it was originally
   developed. The Wii version features motion controls and a reversed
   world where everything that is in the west on the GameCube is in the
   east on the Wii. The display is mirrored in order to make Link
   right-handed to make use of the Wii Remote feel more natural for the
   majority of players. The game chronicles the struggle of a young adult
   Link to confront the troubles of the "Twilight Realm", a mysterious
   force that appears around and interacts with Hyrule. When he enters
   this realm, he is transformed into a wolf, and loses the ability to use
   his sword, shield or other items, but gains other abilities such as
   sharpened senses from his new form. Twilight Princess includes an
   incarnation of Link's horse, Epona, for fast transportation, and
   features mounted battle scenarios including boss battles that were not
   seen in previous games. Twilight Princess diverted from the cel-shading
   of Wind Waker, integrating graphics featuring more detailed textures,
   giving the game a darker atmosphere. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight
   Princess HD released for Wii U in 2016.^[106]

   At 2006 Game Developers Conference, a new title Phantom Hourglass for
   the Nintendo DS was shown. It revealed traditional top-down Zelda
   gameplay optimised for the DS's features, with a cel-shaded 3D
   graphical style similar to The Wind Waker for Gamecube. The game is a
   direct sequel to The Wind Waker.^[107] Phantom Hourglass was released
   in June 2007, for Japan and October for North America and Europe. It
   was later released on the Wii U Virtual Console.

   The next Legend of Zelda game for the DS, Spirit Tracks, was released
   in December 2009. In this game, the "spirit tracks", railroads which
   chain an ancient evil, are disappearing from Hyrule. Zelda and Link go
   to the 'Spirit Tower' (the ethereal point of convergence for the
   tracks) to find out why, but villains steal Zelda's body for the
   resurrection of the Demon King. Rendered disembodied, Zelda is left a
   spirit, and only Link (and a certain few sages) can see her. Together
   they go on a quest to restore the spirit tracks, defeat the Demon King,
   and return Zelda to her body. Using a modified engine of that used in
   Phantom Hourglass, the notably new feature in this game is that the
   Phantom Guardians seen in Phantom Hourglass are, through a series of
   events, periodically controllable. It was the first time in the series
   that both Link and Zelda work together on the quest. It was later
   released on the Wii U Virtual Console.

   A new Zelda game for Wii was in development since the end of
   2000s.^[108] The new title was revealed at E3 2010 as Skyward Sword,
   but its release was delayed to 2011.^[109] The game, the earliest in
   the Legend of Zelda timeline, reveals the origins of Hyrule, Ganon
   (here known as Demise), and many elements featured in previous games;
   it uses Wii's MotionPlus feature as well. It was released in November
   2011; the first run included a 25th Anniversary CD of fully
   orchestrated music from various Zelda games, including Skyward Sword.
   It was made available for download on Wii U in September 2016. An HD
   remaster, with optional button-only controls, was released for Nintendo
   Switch in 2021.^[110]

2013–present: Open-world emphasis

   In 2013, Nintendo released A Link Between Worlds for the Nintendo 3DS,
   a sequel to A Link to the Past.^[111]^[112] Progression is more
   open-ended than previous titles, with the possibility of completing
   many of the game's dungeons in any order. Certain dungeon obstacles
   require the use of rented or purchased items.

   Tri Force Heroes, a cooperative multiplayer game, was released for the
   3DS in October 2015.^[113] It features the same Link as A Link Between
   Worlds but lacks open-world gameplay.
   An in-game screenshot of the protagonist Link, paragliding across a
   vast world. Breath of the Wild, released in 2017 for the Wii U and
   Nintendo Switch, returned the series to fully open-world and nonlinear
   gameplay.

   While Nintendo had showcased a Wii U demo reel at E3 2011 that depicted
   Link fighting a monster in HD^[114] and the first original HD Zelda
   game was scheduled for a 2015 release, it was delayed.^[115] The title
   was finally revealed at E3 2016 as Breath of the Wild, and the game was
   released in March 2017, as the last Nintendo-published game for the Wii
   U and a launch title for the Nintendo Switch.^[116]^[117] Similar to
   the original The Legend of Zelda, players are given little instruction
   and can explore the world freely. The world is designed to encourage
   exploration and experimentation and the main story quest can be
   completed in a nonlinear fashion.

   A Breath of the Wild sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, was released on the
   Switch in May 2023.^[118]^[119] New to Tears of the Kingdom are the
   battery-powered Zonai devices, which the player can use for combat,
   propulsion, exploration, and more. The game also features the new
   abilities to fuse materials together, ascend through ceilings, reverse
   objects' movement through time, and autobuild structures.

   Echoes of Wisdom, which features Zelda as the main protagonist, was
   released in September 2024.^[120]

Other games

Cancelled games

   Throughout the lifespan of The Legend of Zelda series, a number of
   games (including main series games as well as re-releases and
   spin-offs) in varying states of completeness have had their releases
   cancelled. Perhaps the earliest of these was Gottlieb's The Legend of
   Zelda Pinball Machine (cancelled in 1993). After securing a license
   from Nintendo to produce two Nintendo-franchise-based pinball machines,
   pinball designer Jon Norris was tasked with designing the table. Before
   it was completed, Gottlieb decided to repurpose the game with an
   American Gladiators theme. Licensing for this version ultimately fell
   through and the game was released as simply Gladiators in November
   1993.^[121]

   In 1998, Nintendo cancelled Ura Zelda, the Ocarina of Time expansion
   disk for the 64DD^[122] due to poor sales figures for the 64DD
   peripheral.^[123] In 2002, Nintendo released a GameCube bonus disc
   called The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Master Quest.^[122] It
   contains emulated versions of Ocarina of Time and Ocarina of Time
   Master Quest, which Aonuma and Miyamoto each confirmed is Ura
   Zelda.^[123]^[124]

   In 2001, under license from Nintendo, Capcom cancelled the release of
   The Legend of Zelda: Mystical Seed of Courage for Game Boy Color.
   Working with Capcom's subsidiary Flagship, Yoshiki Okamoto was
   originally tasked with designing a series of three Zelda games for the
   Game Boy Color.^[125] Referred to as the "Triforce Series",^[126] the
   games were known as The Legend of Zelda: The Mysterious Acorn: Chapter
   of Power, Chapter of Wisdom, and Chapter of Courage in Japan^[127] and
   The Legend of Zelda: Mystical Seed of Power, Mystical Seed of Wisdom,
   and Mystical Seed of Courage in the US.^[128] The games were to
   interact using a password system,^[126] but the limitations of this
   system and the difficulty of coordinating three games proved too
   complicated, so the team scaled back to two games at Miyamoto's
   suggestion.^[129]^[130] The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons was
   adapted from Mystical Seed of Power, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of
   Ages was adapted from Mystical Seed of Wisdom, and Mystical Seed of
   Courage was cancelled.^[126]

   Before its 2006 release, both Link and Samus from the Metroid series
   were planned to be playable characters for the Wii version of Marvel:
   Ultimate Alliance, but they did not make the final release because they
   were not Marvel characters.^[131]

   In 2011, an unnamed Zelda 25th Anniversary Compilation was cancelled.
   To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the series, Nintendo of America
   originally had planned to release a compilation of games together for
   the Wii, similar to the collector's edition disc released for the
   GameCube in 2003. Nintendo of Japan's president Satoru Iwata and
   Shigeru Miyamoto decided against releasing it, believing it would be
   too similar to the Super Mario 25th Anniversary collection released in
   2010.^[132]

   Retro Studios had two Zelda games in development. One was an untitled
   game starring a Sheikah in a story that explores the origins of the
   Master Sword.^[133]^[134] Another one was titled Heroes of Hyrule and
   it starred Goron, Zora, and Rito who set out to rescue
   Link.^[134]^[135]

Spin-off games

   As the franchise has grown in popularity, several games have been
   released that are set within or star a minor character from the
   universe of The Legend of Zelda but are not directly connected to the
   main The Legend of Zelda series. Both map versions of the game BS Zelda
   no Densetsu for the Satellaview (released in August and December 1995)
   could be considered spin-offs due to the fact that they star the "Hero
   of Light" (portrayed by either the Satellaview's male or female avatar)
   as opposed to Link as the protagonist of Hyrule.^[citation needed] A
   third Satellaview game released in March 1997, BS Zelda no Densetsu
   Inishie no Sekiban (BS The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets)
   could also be considered a spin-off for the same reason.^[citation
   needed] Other spin-off games include Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy
   Rupeeland for the Nintendo DS, an RPG released in September 2006 in
   Japan (Summer of 2007 in the UK) to star supporting character Tingle. A
   second Tingle game is Tingle's Balloon Fight DS for the Nintendo DS.
   Here Tingle again stars in this spin-off arcade style platformer,
   released in April 2007 only in Japan and available solely to Platinum
   Club Nintendo members.

   In addition to games in which Link does not star as the protagonist,
   games such as the shooter game, Link's Crossbow Training (for the Wii),
   have been considered spin-offs due to the lack of a traditional "Save
   Hyrule" plot-line. Released in November 2007 as a bundle with the Wii
   Zapper, this game allows players to assume the identity of Link as he
   progresses through a series of tests to perfect his crossbow
   marksmanship. Color Changing Tingle's Love Balloon Trip was released in
   Japan in 2009 as a sequel to Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland.

   Hyrule Warriors, a crossover game combining the setting of Nintendo's
   The Legend of Zelda series and the gameplay of Tecmo Koei's Dynasty
   Warriors series, was released in North America in September 2014 for
   Wii U. Hyrule Warriors Legends, a version for the Nintendo 3DS
   containing more content and gameplay modifications, was released in
   March 2016.

   To commemorate the launch of the My Nintendo loyalty program in March
   2016, Nintendo released My Nintendo Picross: The Legend of Zelda:
   Twilight Princess, a Picross puzzle game developed by Jupiter for
   download to the Nintendo 3DS.^[136]^[137]

   Cadence of Hyrule, developed by Brace Yourself Games and released in
   June 2019, is an officially licensed crossover of Zelda with Crypt of
   the NecroDancer.^[138]

   Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, developed by Koei Tecmo, shares the
   hack-and-slash style of the spin-off game Hyrule Warriors.^[139] Age of
   Calamity was released in November 2020.^[140]^[72]

   A new Zelda-themed variant of Vermin was included on the limited
   edition Game & Watch: The Legend of Zelda unit, released in 2021. This
   special edition of the Game & Watch also included The Legend of Zelda,
   The Adventure of Link, and Link's Awakening.

   The Legend of Zelda series has received outstanding levels of acclaim
   from critics and the public. Ocarina of Time, Skyward Sword, Breath of
   the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom have each received a perfect 10/10
   score by British Edge magazine.^[210] All four plus Wind Waker also
   received a 40/40 score (10/10 by four reviewers) by Japanese Famitsu
   magazine,^[211]^[212] making Zelda one of the few series with multiple
   perfect scores. Ocarina of Time was even listed by Guinness World
   Records as the highest-rated video game in history, citing its
   Metacritic score of 99 out of 100.^[213] Computer and Video Games
   awarded The Wind Waker and Twilight Princess a score of
   10/10.^[214]^[215] A Link to the Past has won Gold Award from
   Electronic Gaming Monthly. In Nintendo Power's Top 200 countdown in
   2004, Ocarina of Time took first place, and seven other Zelda games
   placed in the top 40.^[216] Twilight Princess was named Game of the
   Year by X-Play, GameTrailers, 1UP, Electronic Gaming Monthly, Spacey
   Awards, Game Informer, GameSpy, Nintendo Power, IGN, and many other
   websites. The editors of review aggregator websites GameRankings, IGN
   and Metacritic have all given Ocarina of Time their highest aggregate
   scores.^[217] Game Informer has awarded The Wind Waker, Twilight
   Princess, Skyward Sword, A Link Between Worlds and Breath of the Wild
   with scores of 10/10. Phantom Hourglass was named DS Game of the Year
   by IGN and GameSpy.^[218]^[219] Airing in December 2011, Spike TV's
   annual Video Game Awards gave the series the first ever "Hall of Fame
   Award", which Miyamoto accepted in person.^[220] Ocarina of Time and
   its use of melodic themes to identify different game regions has been
   called a reverse of Richard Wagner's use of leitmotifs to identify
   characters and themes.^[221] Ocarina of Time was so well received that
   sales increased for real ocarinas.^[222] IGN praised the music of
   Majora's Mask for its brilliance despite its heavy use of MIDI. It has
   been ranked the seventh-greatest game by Electronic Gaming Monthly,
   whereas Ocarina of Time was ranked eighth.^[223]^[224] The series won
   GameFAQs Best Series Ever competition.^[225]

   As of September 2024, The Legend of Zelda franchise has sold over 156.1
   million copies,^[n 9] with the original The Legend of Zelda being the
   fourth best-selling NES game of all time.^[230]^[231] The series was
   ranked as the 64th top game (collectively) by Next Generation in
   1996.^[232] In 1999, Next Generation listed the Zelda series as number
   1 on their "Top 50 Games of All Time", commenting that Zelda series had
   always more gameplay and innovations than most other titles in their
   series.^[233] According to British film magazine Empire, with "the most
   vividly-realised world and the most varied game-play of any game on any
   console, Zelda is a solid bet for the best game series ever".^[234]

   The Legend of Zelda franchise has garnered the most Game of the Year
   nominations in the history of the Academy of Interactive Arts &
   Sciences' D.I.C.E. Awards with eight (Ocarina of Time,^[235] Majora's
   Mask,^[236] The Wind Waker,^[237] Twilight Princess,^[238] Skyward
   Sword,^[239] A Link Between Worlds,^[240] Breath of the Wild,^[241] and
   Tears of the Kingdom^[242]); two of them, Ocarina of Time^[235] and
   Breath of the Wild,^[243] would go on to win the top honor during their
   respective awards ceremonies.

Legacy

   Multiple members of the game industry have expressed how Zelda games
   have impacted them, including Rockstar Games founder and Grand Theft
   Auto director, Dan Houser, who said that Zelda and Mario games on
   Nintendo 64 greatly influenced them in developing Grand Theft Auto
   series, as well in other 3D games in general.^[244] Rockstar founder
   and Grand Theft Auto director Sam Houser also cited the influence of
   Zelda, describing Grand Theft Auto III as "Zelda meets
   Goodfellas".^[245] Ōkami director Hideki Kamiya (Capcom, PlatinumGames)
   said that he has been influenced by The Legend of Zelda series in
   developing the game, citing A Link to the Past as his favorite game of
   all time.^[246] Soul Reaver and Uncharted director, Amy Hennig (Crystal
   Dynamics and Naughty Dog), cited Zelda as inspiration for the Legacy of
   Kain series, noting A Link to the Past's influence on Blood Omen and
   Ocarina of Time's influence on Soul Reaver.^[247] Soul Reaver and
   Uncharted creator, Richard Lemarchand (Crystal Dynamics and Naughty
   Dog), also cited A Link to the Past's approach to combining gameplay
   with storytelling as inspiration for Soul Reaver.^[248] Wing Commander
   and Star Citizen director, Chris Roberts (Origin Systems and Cloud
   Imperium Games), cited Zelda as an influence on his action role-playing
   game, Times of Lore.^[249]

   Dark Souls series creator Hidetaka Miyazaki named A Link To The Past as
   one of his favorite role-playing video games.^[250] Miyazaki also
   described The Legend of Zelda as a sort of textbook for 3D action
   games.^[251] Ico director Fumito Ueda cited Zelda as an influence on
   Shadow of the Colossus.^[252] Peter Molyneux (Lionhead Studios and
   Microsoft Studios) stated that the Twilight Princess is one of his
   favorite games and an influence for the Fable series.^[253] Darksiders
   director David Adams (Vigil Games) cited Zelda as an influence on his
   work.^[254] Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed director Raphael
   Lacoste cited The Wind Waker as an influence on Assassin's Creed IV:
   Black Flag.^[255] CD Projekt Red cited the Zelda series as an influence
   on The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.^[256] Majora's Mask served as the primary
   influence on Alex Hall's web series Ben Drowned.^[257] Final Fantasy
   and The 3rd Birthday director Hajime Tabata cited Ocarina of Time as
   inspiration for the open world of Final Fantasy XV.^[258]

Cross-overs

   The Legend of Zelda series has crossed over into other Nintendo and
   third-party video games, most prominently in the Super Smash Bros.
   series of fighting games published by Nintendo. Link appears as a
   fighter in Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64, the first entry in
   the series, and is part of the roster in all subsequent releases in the
   series as well. Zelda (who is able to transform into Sheik as well),
   Ganondorf, and Young Link (the child version of Link from Ocarina of
   Time) were added to the player roster for Super Smash Bros. Melee, and
   appeared in all subsequent releases except for "Young Link" (who is
   later replaced by "Toon Link" from The Wind Waker, in subsequent
   releases Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS
   and Wii U). Both Young Link and Toon Link appear in the fifth
   installment, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Other elements from the
   series, such as locations and items, are also included throughout the
   Smash Bros. series. Outside of the series, Nintendo allowed for the use
   of Link as a playable character exclusively in the GameCube release of
   Namco's fighting game Soulcalibur II.^[259]
     * Link, using a design based on Skyward Sword, appears as a playable
       character in Mario Kart 8 via downloadable content (DLC), along
       with a "Hyrule Circuit" racetrack themed on The Legend of Zelda
       series.^[260] The first pack is named after the series. In a
       post-launch update for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Link and his vehicle
       received alternate styles based on Breath of the Wild.^[261]
     * In the Wii U version of Sonic Lost World, a DLC stage based on The
       Legend of Zelda series was released in March 2014, named "The
       Legend of Zelda Zone". It was built around the core gameplay
       mechanics of Sonic Lost World, with some elements from the Zelda
       series, including a heart-based vitality meter, rupee collection,
       and a miniature dungeon to explore.^[262]

In other media

TV series

   See also: The Super Mario Bros. Super Show! § Format

   A 13-episode American animated TV series, adapted by DiC and
   distributed by Viacom Enterprises, aired in 1989.^[263] The animated
   Zelda shorts were broadcast each Friday, instead of the usual Super
   Mario Bros. cartoon which was aired during the rest of the
   week.^[264]^[265] The series loosely follows the two NES Zelda games
   (the original The Legend of Zelda and The Adventure of Link), mixing
   settings and characters from those games with original creations.^[266]
   The show's older incarnations of both Link and Zelda appeared in
   various episodes of Captain N: The Game Master during its second
   season.^[267]

   A live-action television series had been in development around 2015, as
   reported from an anonymous Netflix employee to The Wall Street Journal.
   The program was a joint effort between Netflix and Nintendo, and was
   said to be aimed as a family-friendly version of Game of Thrones.^[268]
   Further details of this series went sparse until 2021 when Adam Conover
   gave an interview regarding his College Humor period. There, the
   College Humor team had been planning a skit that would have combined
   Star Fox with Fantastic Mr. Fox and had even had talked to Miyamoto on
   the project. Conover said that they were told about a month into the
   project that Nintendo had requested they stop all work on the project
   as a result of the leak related to the live-action Zelda show;
   Nintendo, already protective of its IP, had pulled many external
   projects including the live-action show.^[269]

Print media

   Valiant Comics released a short series of comics featuring characters
   and settings from the Zelda cartoon as part of their Nintendo Comics
   System line. Manga adaptations of many entries in the series, including
   A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Oracle of Seasons
   and Oracle of Ages, Four Swords Adventures, The Minish Cap, Phantom
   Hourglass, and Twilight Princess have been produced under license from
   Nintendo, primarily written and drawn by Japanese artist duo Akira
   Himekawa. These adaptations do not strictly follow the plot of the
   games from which they are based and may contain additional story
   elements.

   A number of official books, novels, and gamebooks have been released
   based on the series as well. The earliest was Moblin's Magic Spear,
   published in 1989 by Western Publishing under their Golden Books Family
   Entertainment division and written by Jack C. Harris. It took place
   sometime during the first game. Two gamebooks were published as part of
   the Nintendo Adventure Books series by Archway, both of which were
   written by Matt Wayne. The first was The Crystal Trap (which focuses
   more on Zelda) and the second was The Shadow Prince. Both were released
   in 1992. A novel based on Ocarina of Time was released in 1999, written
   by Jason R. Rich and published by Sybex Inc. under their Pathways to
   Adventure series. Another two gamebooks were released as part of the
   You Decide on the Adventure series published by Scholastic. The first
   book was based on Oracle of Seasons and was released in 2001. The
   second, based on Oracle of Ages, was released in 2002. Both were
   written by Craig Wessel. In 2006, Scholastic released a novel as part
   of their Nintendo Heroes series, Link and the Portal of Doom. It was
   written by Tracey West and was set shortly after the events of Ocarina
   of Time.

   In 2011, to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the series, an art
   book was published exclusively in Japan under the name Hyrule Historia
   by Shogakukan. It contains concept art from the series's conception to
   the release of Skyward Sword in 2011 and multiple essays about the
   production of the games, as well as an overarching timeline of the
   series. It also includes a prequel manga to Skyward Sword by Akira
   Himekawa. The book received an international release by publisher Dark
   Horse Comics in January 2013;^[270] it took the number one spot on
   Amazon's sales chart, taking the spot away from E. L. James's 50 Shades
   of Grey trilogy.^[271] Dark Horse released The Legend of Zelda: Art &
   Artifacts, a follow-up art book to Hyrule Historia containing
   additional artwork and interviews,^[272]^[273] in North America and
   Europe in February 2017.^[274]

Music

   Taking place in Cologne, Germany, on September 23, 2010, the video game
   music concert Symphonic Legends focused on music from Nintendo and,
   among others, featured games such as The Legend of Zelda. Following an
   intermission, the second half of the concert was entirely dedicated to
   an expansive symphonic poem dedicated to the series. The 35-minute epic
   tells the story of Link's evolution from child to hero.^[275]^[276]

   To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the series in 2011, Nintendo
   commissioned an original symphony, The Legend of Zelda: Symphony of the
   Goddesses. The show was originally performed in the fall of 2011 in Los
   Angeles and consists of live performances of much of the music from the
   series.^[277] It has since been scheduled for 18 shows so far
   throughout the United States and Canada.^[277]^[278] Nintendo released
   a CD, The Legend of Zelda 25th Anniversary Special Orchestra CD.
   Featuring eight tracks from live performances of the symphony, the CD
   is included alongside the special edition of The Legend of Zelda:
   Skyward Sword for the Wii. Nintendo later celebrated The Legend of
   Zelda's 30th anniversary with an album which was released in Japan in
   February 2017.^[279]

Merchandise

   The Legend of Zelda-themed Monopoly board game was released in the
   United States in September 2014.^[280] A Clue board game in the style
   of The Legend of Zelda series was released in June 2017.^[281] A
   UNO-styled The Legend of Zelda game was released in February 2018,
   exclusively at GameStop in North America.^[282] A limited edition Zelda
   25th anniversary 3DS was released in December 2011, in Australia.^[283]

Film

   In 2007, Imagi Animation Studios, which had provided the animation for
   TMNT and Astro Boy, created a pitch reel for a computer-animated The
   Legend of Zelda film. Nintendo did not accept the studio's offer due to
   the memory of the failure of the 1993 live-action film adaptation of
   Super Mario Bros.^[284] In 2013, Aonuma said that, if the development
   of a film began, the company would want to use the opportunity to
   embrace audience interaction in some capacity.^[285]^[286] In June
   2023, it was said that Nintendo was close to closing a deal with
   Illumination and Universal Pictures to produce a film adaptation of the
   franchise following the success of their film, The Super Mario Bros.
   Movie,^[287] but Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri denied these reports
   later that month.^[288]

   By November 2023, Nintendo was developing a live-action Legend of Zelda
   film with Sony Pictures, which will co-finance and distribute the
   project worldwide.^[289] Wes Ball has been attached to direct the film,
   and Shigeru Miyamoto and Avi Arad will be producing alongside Ball and
   his producing partner Joe Hartwick Jr. through their Oddball
   Entertainment company.^[290] Although the casting had not been
   announced, Patricia Summersett, who had previously done voice work for
   Princess Zelda, said that she would like to reprise her role for the
   character.^[291]^[292] Hunter Schafer has also expressed interest in
   playing Zelda.^[293]
