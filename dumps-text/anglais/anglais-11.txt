10 Blurred Lines around the Reality of the Slender Man Legends

   We all know that the Slender Man is nothing more than a pure urban
   legend created online in 2009 on an Internet forum. However, since
   then, it has taken on a life of its own, even being connected with
   several attempted murders as well as a spate of suicides and a possible
   mass suicide attempt.

   While nobody is arguing that the Slender Man is real (at least in the
   physical sense), the belief in him by some has made the consequences of
   the legend very real for some. Here are ten very unsettling points
   about the legend and reality of the Slender Man.

10 Very Definite Origins

   Unlike many other legends and myths, the origins of the Slender Man can
   be traced to the exact date of its creation. At some point on June 10,
   2009, the Internet forum Something Awful unleashed two photographs.
   They were created by user Victor Surge (whose real name was eventually
   revealed to be Eric Knudsen). He had created them in response to a
   challenge by the forum’s admin—to create “paranormal images” that might
   make people believe they were genuine.

   The first picture, dating from 1983, showed a group of children looking
   upset and frightened. In the background is a discreet, extraordinarily
   tall, faceless man. The caption read: “We didn’t want to go, we didn’t
   want to kill them, but its persistent silence and outstretched arms
   horrified us and comforted us at the same time!” That quote was
   attributed to the unknown photographer, who was “presumed dead.”

   The second picture was dated three years later, in 1986. It showed
   children looking altogether happier while playing in a park.
   Discreetly, though, the same tall figure can be seen lurking in the
   background. The caption informed those who viewed the picture that it
   was “one of two recovered photographs from the Stirling City Library
   blaze.” It also stated that the photo was taken “the day which fourteen
   children vanished” and even referenced “Slender Man.” This time the
   photographer was “named” as Mary Thomas, who had been missing since
   June 1986.

   These two pictures not only gave birth to the Slender Man legends, but
   they also captivated thousands upon thousands of people almost
   immediately.^[1]

9 A Legend Made by “The People”

   Although Knudsen was responsible for the Slender Man’s creation, it
   would be the many followers of Creepypasta who would truly bring him to
   life. As more and more people became aware of Slender Man and added
   their own details and little pieces of the backstory, the legend grew.

   He was often depicted with a white, featureless face and was slim,
   abnormally tall, and often with tentacles coming from his back. He also
   became associated with abandoned buildings, often in the wilderness or
   the woods. Some details added later even claimed that the Slender Man
   could teleport from one place to another. Those who were interested in
   the Slender Man even “agreed” signs that he was near and watching you.
   Such signs as sudden paranoia, nosebleeds, and intense nightmares.

   In fact, this creation of a legend by the audience themselves is the
   subject of our next point. How this growth can be monitored and studied
   by those who study myths and folklore of the past.^[2]

8 See a Legend Grow and Develop

   Myths, Fables, Legends, and Fairy Tales

   Many who study legends, folklore, and mythology have looked at the
   Slender Man legends as a way of being able to document its growth and
   reach. And in doing so, they look to understand how legends of the past
   might have developed and grown in a similar way. For example, there is
   a collective element to the growth of the Slender Man legend, as we
   examined above. What’s more, slight details change depending on who is
   telling the tale or who the audience might be. Indeed, the more
   accounts that were retold of the Slender Man (online as opposed to
   orally, in this case), the more the legend and the backstory grew.

   The Slender Man legend had very quickly taken on a life of its own,
   much like myths and folklore of the past. However, several years after
   his creation, the Slender Man became “real” in a much grittier way.^[3]

7 The Slender Man Stabbing

   On May 31, 2014, the Slender Man, or at least the consequences of the
   legend, spilled over into the real world in a very dramatic way. On the
   morning in question, two 12-year-old girls, Anissa Weier and Morgan
   Geyser, attempted to murder their friend, Payton Leutner, by stabbing
   her multiple times in the woods. After being left for dead, she
   eventually stumbled out and was discovered by a passing cyclist.

   The girls were arrested a short time later. When questioned, Weier
   claimed they had launched the attack in order to please the Slender
   Man. What’s more, they also believed they knew where the Slender Man
   lived (an old house in the Nicolet National Forest), a location they
   were on their way to when they were arrested.

   For all intents and purposes, it could be argued that for the attackers
   and their victim alike, the Slender Man, or the consequences of him,
   were very real. Incidentally, Weier was released from a mental health
   facility in the summer of 2021. Geyser, on the other hand, remains
   incarcerated. Payton Leutner recovered from the nineteen stab wounds
   she received from her “friends.”^[4]

   Following the attempted murder of Payton Leutner, several copycat cases
   occurred, all with various connections to the Slender Man legends. For
   example, only weeks later, in June 2014, in Hamilton County, Ohio, a
   13-year-old girl attacked her mother with a knife. In the investigation
   that followed, it was discovered that she had an “obsession” with the
   Slender Man.

   Several months after that, in September 2014, in Port Richey, Florida,
   a 14-year-old girl set fire to her family home. According to reports,
   she was ‘inspired’ by the Slender Man to do so. Incidentally, all of
   those inside escaped the burning building, and the young girl was
   arrested the following morning.

   Even the murders of two police officers and a member of the public in
   Las Vegas in the summer of 2014, followed by the suicide of the alleged
   killer and his wife, was connected to the Slender Man after neighbors
   told the media that he would often dress up as the Internet legend and
   parade around his house and yard.^[5]

5 Suicides Connected to the Slender Man

   In the summer of 2015, The New York Times published an article
   detailing the suicides of multiple young people between the ages of 12
   and 24 who had committed suicide on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South
   Dakota in the previous six months alone. What is particularly
   interesting about this wave of suicides is that the article also
   claimed that “several officials with knowledge of the cases said that
   at least one of the youths who committed suicide was influenced by
   Slender Man.”

   What is further interesting about the alleged connections to the
   Slender Man legends and these tragic deaths are legends of the
   reservation itself. They speak of a spirit named the Tall Man or
   Walking Sam. What this spirit did was to encourage those he chose to
   visit to take their own lives. It is perhaps a coincidence that there
   are similarities between the legends of the Slender Man and these
   Native American legends. However, the coming together of them within
   this reservation’s community very well might have resulted in tragic
   consequences.^[6]

4 Aborted Mass Suicide and Connections to Native American Legends

   A particularly grim account tells of a narrowly aborted mass suicide at
   the same reservation mentioned above. According to the story, multiple
   teenagers suddenly set out to a specific spot in the woods and started
   preparing ropes by tying them to the branches of the trees. They were
   clearly planning on committing suicide, hanging themselves together as
   a group.

   The local pastor on the reservation, John Two Bulls, heard of the
   morose plans and immediately set out to the location. He, fortunately,
   managed to halt the proceedings and seemingly bring the group out of
   whatever mass-trance they appeared to have been in.

   Rumblings from the reservation claimed that the cause of the attempted
   mass suicide was a result of the visitation of Walking Sam. Given the
   publicity that the Slender Man was receiving at this stage, it is
   perhaps easy to understand how some in the media connected the legend
   of the suicide spirit and this new urban legend. ^[7]

3 “Lacy” – A Truly Bizarre Account

   Nick Redfern – The Slenderman Mysteries

   Paranormal author and researcher Nick Redfern relayed a particularly
   intriguing account that was told to him. The witness—who he gave the
   name “Lacy”—would claim to have had several real-life encounters with
   the Slender Man, although not physical encounters.

   She would claim that she had been researching the Slender Man for
   several months. Then, one evening, her laptop (which was on sleep mode)
   suddenly switched on of its own accord. To her shock, an image of a
   faceless creature was on the screen. Within a few seconds, it was gone.
   She told herself she must have imagined it. However, two nights later,
   the laptop once more switched on of its own accord. When it did, the
   face appeared again, only this time it was much clearer.

   Things went quiet for several weeks, and Lacy had almost forgotten the
   incidents. That was until her laptop came on again. This time, a
   strange voice came from the device stating, “we are friends.” It was at
   this point that Lacy shut the laptop down and ceased her research into
   the Slender Man legends.

   It is easy (and perhaps right) to suggest that what Lacy experienced,
   at best, were hallucinations brought on by her intense interest in and
   subconscious fear of the Slender Man legends. It is interesting to note
   once more, though, that the fine line in a person believing in a legend
   suddenly “making it real” is indeed delicate in the extreme.^[8]

2 Intense Internet Debate

   What If Slender Man Was Real?

   What If Slender Man Was Real?
   Watch this video on YouTube

   As we might imagine, a fierce debate ensued following the attempting
   stabbing and the copycat cases that followed. And while it concentrated
   on the Slender Man at first, it soon moved on to the Internet and the
   influence it has on children in general. For example, in the Waukesha
   School District, where the attempted murder of Payton Leutner took
   place, Creepypasta Wiki was blocked. For their part, the administrators
   of the website claimed that the stabbing was an “isolated incident.”
   They also claimed their website was a literary one and not one that
   condoned murder.

   Ultimately, it was reasoned that all manner of films, TV programs, and
   video games that children had access to did not result in such
   atrocious attacks. In short, the problem was with the attackers
   themselves as opposed to the apparent catalyst. Although the debate
   originally had momentum, the more it went on, the less sway it had.^[9]

1 A Contemporary Equivalent of the Boogeyman

   Folklore – The Boogie Man

   Folklore - The Boogie Man

   There is little doubt that the Slender Man is the Boogeyman of the
   modern age. If you talk to anyone in the western world under the age of
   20, it is almost certain they will know who the Slender Man is. They
   might not know the history or even how they heard of him, but the fact
   is, they know. And although they understand—at least for the most
   part—that he is nothing more than an urban legend, he is without a
   doubt in their collective subconscious.

   There are certainly very definite similarities between the Slender Man
   and the Boogeyman. Both are on the prowl for children, for example, and
   both have grim abodes in out-of-the-way locations, often in the woods.

   Of course, where the legend of the Slender Man goes from here remains
   to be seen. Perhaps he will still be spoken in hundreds of years by
   spooked youngsters around the world as much as he is today.^[10]
