   Is there a minimum vertical spacing between items in ggplot2 legend?

   I am trying to reduce the space between legend keys. This code seems to
   suggest there is an absolute minimum (i.e. 0.001 pt).
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, col = as.factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(legend.key.spacing.y = unit(0.001, "pt"))

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, col = as.factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(legend.key.spacing.y = unit(10, "pt"))

     * r
     * ggplot2

       Could you clarify what's the issue? Also be aware that
       legend.spacing.y sets the spacing between legends, whereas
       legend.**key**.spacing.y sets the spacing between the keys or
       items.

       Yes, I get the difference between legend.spacing.y and
       legend.key.spacing.y. The publisher wants less space between the
       key items.

     * The negative point thing worked like a charm. But jesus, It would
       be nice for that to be described somewhere.

   You can use legend.key.height within theme():
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, col = as.factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(legend.key.height = unit(0.001, 'mm')
        )
