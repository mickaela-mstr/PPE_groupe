   ESPN's Top 100 Athletes: Simone Biles (1:05)

   Check out the athletic feats of Simone Biles, one of the greatest
   gymnasts in history and No. 7 on ESPN's list of the top 100 athletes of
   the past 25 years. (1:05)

   The greatest athlete of the 21st century? That's easy. It has to be Tom
   Brady, the quarterback of the greatest dynasty America's favorite sport
   has ever seen, a seven-time Super Bowl champ and five-time Super Bowl
   MVP. Yep. Tom Brady.

   Except. Except it has to be Lionel Messi, the best player in the
   world's favorite sport, an eight-time Ballon d'Or winner as the
   footballer of the year. Yep, definitely Messi.

   Except ... no ... LeBron James, right? Four-time NBA champ, four-time
   Finals MVP, four-time regular-season MVP, 20-time All-NBA, most points
   scored in NBA history. No athlete has dominated the public conversation
   like LeBron has. He has to be No. 1.

   Except, what about Serena Williams? Winner of 23 Grand Slam titles, the
   Serena Slam (holding all four major titles at the same time) and four
   Olympic gold medals. And she got her final Grand Slam event win while
   pregnant, putting her career on hold while she was at her most
   dominant.

   Except, if you are going to pick a tennis player, what about Roger
   Federer? He transformed an entire sport with his artistry, his chess
   game on the court, his blazing forehand. He won 20 Grand Slam titles
   and became the most beloved tennis player of all time. Gotta be Fed.

   Yeah, except Rafael Nadal won 22 Grand Slam titles and Novak Djokovic
   has won 24. You have to pick one of them over Federer.

   Hmm. Maybe this isn't so easy. We didn't even mention the Olympians:
   Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps and Katie Ledecky and Simone Biles. Or
   Kobe. Gotta throw Kobe Bryant into the discussion. Or Lewis Hamilton.
   Or Peyton Manning. Or Floyd Mayweather. Or Tiger. Geez, almost forgot
   about Tiger Woods.

   Yes, ranking the top 100 most accomplished athletes since 2000 wasn't
   quite so easy after all -- but it sure was fun. Twenty-five years ago,
   the ESPN SportsCentury project ranked the top 100 North American
   athletes of the 20th century. Michael Jordan came in first, followed by
   Babe Ruth, Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown and Wayne Gretzky. (Ruth should have
   been No. 1, but hey, I'm a baseball writer.) We also ranked a horse:
   Secretariat came in at No. 35.

Your League, Your Rules

   Create a league and customize league size, scoring and rules to play in
   the league you want to play in.

   Create a league today!

   With so many transcendent athletes over the past 25 years, we thought
   it was time to do another ranking. I promise you there are no horses
   this time (sorry, American Pharoah). In considering the best athletes
   of the 21st century, however, we have expanded our choices beyond North
   America. ESPN editions from around the globe contributed to the
   nominations and voting process, as well as the individual sport list
   rankings that will follow.

   Voters were instructed to consider only an athlete's performance since
   2000. So, for Barry Bonds: He won seven MVP awards, but only four of
   those came after 2000, as did 317 of his 762 home runs. Or Ken Griffey
   Jr.: He played until 2010, but all of his best seasons came in the
   1990s. Tiger won 13 of his 15 majors from 2000 on, so he's in good
   shape. Other athletes, such as Patrick Mahomes or Nikola Jokic or
   Shohei Ohtani, obviously have more greatness ahead of them, so we'll
   see how high their accomplishments so far get them on the list.

   In the end, we received more than 70,000 votes from ESPN contributors
   to create our top 100.

   Let the arguments begin. -- David Schoenfield, ESPN senior writer

1. Michael Phelps, swimming

   Key accomplishments: Record 28-time Olympic medalist, 23-time Olympic
   gold medalist, most gold medals at a single Olympics when he won eight
   at Beijing in 2008

   At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Phelps earned a historic eight gold
   medals, more than any athlete in a single Olympics, while breaking
   world records in seven of his eight races. Throughout the Games, fans
   and members of the media tried to crack the code on what made Phelps --
   who eventually won 23 Olympic gold medals and became the most decorated
   Olympian of all time -- so unbeatable. His mother, Debbie Phelps, was
   in Beijing, and often fielded their questions. Was it his size-14 feet?
   His extra-long arms? His breakfast regimen? "No," Debbie answered
   repeatedly. "It's his hard work." -- Alyssa Roenigk

2. Serena Williams, tennis

   Key accomplishments: 23-time major champion (second most by any player
   all time), women's record 365 major match wins, 73 career titles are
   fifth most by a woman in the Open era

   There is little that Williams didn't achieve during her record-setting
   career, including winning 23 major titles. But it might have been her
   last one that was the most improbable. She needed to win one more Grand
   Slam to break the tie with Steffi Graf for most in the Open era (which
   began in 1968) -- a mark Williams said she had been "chasing for a
   really long time" -- and remained in the 2017 Australian Open draw even
   after finding out she was pregnant shortly before competition began.
   She was in peak Serena form, never dropping a set en route to a final
   showdown with her sister Venus. She defeated Venus to take sole
   ownership of the record.

   Williams played in four more major finals after her return from
   maternity leave and a complicated childbirth. She didn't win another
   title. "The way I see it, I should have had 30-plus Grand Slams,"
   Williams wrote in Vogue in a 2022 essay announcing her impending
   retirement. "I didn't get there ... But I showed up 23 times, and
   that's fine. Actually it's extraordinary." -- D'Arcy Maine

3. Lionel Messi, soccer

   Key accomplishments: 10-time LaLiga champion, seven-time Copa del Rey
   winner, four-time Champions League winner, six-time Champions League
   top scorer, 17-time FIFA FIFPRO World 11, World Cup winner, two-time
   Copa America winner, two-time FIFA World Cup Golden Ball winner,
   eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, record goal scorer for Barcelona and
   Argentina

   Messi winning the World Cup in Argentina in 2022 was perhaps the
   biggest Hollywood ending that soccer has ever seen. After losing the
   2014 final, it looked like it would never happen for Messi, who had won
   everything else in the game for club and country, but the crowning
   moment of his career finally arrived at age 34. He scored twice in the
   final as Argentina beat France on penalties, sparking an outpouring of
   emotion and celebrations around the globe. "This guy transcends
   rivalries -- even between Brazil and Argentina," Brazil legend Ronaldo
   said. "I saw Brazilians and people all over the world rooting for
   Messi. It's a fitting finale for a genius who has marked an era." --

   [greyline.png] [240715_top-100_inlines_004.jpg]

4. LeBron James, basketball

   Key accomplishments: NBA 75th Anniversary team, NBA's all-time scoring
   leader, 20-time All-Star, 19-time All-NBA selection, six-time
   All-Defense, four-time MVP, four-time Finals MVP, four-time NBA
   champion, three-time All-Star Game MVP

   The "48 special" game happened 17 years ago this spring. That's when
   James scored 29 of the last 30 points for the Cleveland Cavaliers in a
   double-overtime upset Game 5 road win against the Detroit Pistons in
   the Eastern Conference finals. The 48-point game was a mesmerizing
   performance that stands as one of the classic games of this century ...
   and it probably doesn't even rank in the top 10 of James' playoff
   performances. It might not be one of his top three conference finals
   games. This is what James' greatness rests on: No one has ever been
   this good for this long. That long-ago night in the Palace of Auburn
   Hills is merely one of 29 40-point games James has in the playoffs
   alone.

   That win paved the way to his first Finals, starting a run of 10
   appearances in 14 years. During that stretch he won four NBA titles,
   four MVPs and four Finals MVPs with three different teams, as well as
   two Olympic gold medals. He also won at least one road game in 29
   consecutive playoff series. He has scored in double figures in 1,222
   consecutive regular-season games -- the last time he didn't, his son
   Bronny, now his Laker teammate, was 2 years old. Volume isn't a vogue
   way to measure achievement in the NBA anymore, and it lends credence to
   those who want to push James down all-time lists. It's the only side of
   the argument to take against James, who has essentially renamed the
   NBA's record book for himself. -- Brian Windhorst
     * LeBron's path to 40,000 points

   [greyline.png] [top-100_inlines_005.jpg]

5. Tom Brady, football

   Key accomplishments: Seven-time Super Bowl champion, five-time Super
   Bowl MVP, three-time NFL MVP, two-time AP Offensive POY, 15-time Pro
   Bowler, three-time first-team All-Pro, NFL record for career passing
   yards/TDs

   When Brady was asked which of his seven Super Bowl rings was his
   favorite, he was fond of answering: "The next one." That sums up the
   player whom Bill Belichick referred to as the "ultimate winner" who
   often played his best when the stakes were highest. Belichick noted how
   Brady entered the NFL as a sixth-round pick "with little to no fanfare"
   and left "as the most successful player in league history." Said
   Belichick: "His relentless pursuit of excellence drove him on a daily
   basis. His work ethic and desire to win were both motivational and
   inspirational to teammates and coaches alike." -- Mike Reiss

6. Roger Federer, tennis

   Key accomplishments: 20-time major champion, 369 majors wins, eight
   Wimbledon titles (most by a man all time), 103 tour singles titles
   (second most by man in Open era)

   It's not unusual for a professional athlete to feel emotional during
   their final match or game before retiring. But what is unusual is when
   everyone else in the competition is equally emotional about it. Such
   was the case for Federer during the last match of his career at the
   Laver Cup -- an event he co-founded -- in 2022. Having previously
   announced a doubles match alongside Rafael Nadal would be his swan
   song, Nadal -- his fiercest of rivals for nearly 20 years -- cried
   right alongside him when it was over, as did Novak Djokovic, Andy
   Murray, the rest of their European teammates and even Jack Sock and
   Frances Tiafoe, their opponents from the World team. "I think we are
   all going to be forever grateful to be a part of the GOAT's final
   match," Sock said later. -- D'Arcy Maine
     * Roger Federer is retiring from tennis -- his mark on the sport is
       indelible

   [greyline.png] [240715_top-100_inlines_007.jpg]

7. Simone Biles, gymnastics

   Key accomplishments: Seven-time Olympic medalist (tied for most by
   American gymnast), four Olympic gold medals (2016, tied for most by
   female gymnast at single Games)

   Since winning her first national title in 2013, Biles has gone
   undefeated in all-around competition in every meet she has competed in,
   a staggering achievement in a sport that used to age-out athletes in
   their teens. Now 27, Biles punctuated her return to gymnastics after
   taking two years off following the Tokyo Games by winning U.S. trials
   by an astounding 5.5 points. In her third Olympics in Paris, Biles can
   become the first gymnast to win all-around gold in nonconsecutive
   Olympics. She also has five skills that bear her name -- including a
   vault with the highest difficulty level in women's gymnastics. --

8. Tiger Woods, golf

   Key accomplishments: 13 major wins (most of any player during span), 11
   major wins as world No. 1 golfer (nine more than any other player all
   time)

   Even after a record-breaking career in which Woods won 82 times on the
   PGA Tour, including 15 major championships, and was ranked the No. 1
   golfer in the world for 281 consecutive weeks and 683 overall, golf
   fans are still left wondering what the Hall of Famer might have
   accomplished had injuries and self-inflicted problems off the course
   not hampered him over the past 15 years. That's a testament to Woods'
   greatness on the course, where he won 131 times around the world. He
   won his first major at age 21 and brought youth and energy to a sport
   that desperately needed it with his fist pumps and club twirls. -- Mark

9. Usain Bolt, track

   Key accomplishments: Eight-time Olympic gold medalist, 100m
   world-record holder, only sprinter to win Olympic 100m and 200m titles
   at three consecutive Olympics

   Their legs are a blur. What's in focus is Bolt's expressive mug as he
   surges ahead in the 100-meter semifinal at the 2016 Rio Olympics, his
   fourth and final Games. In the photo, the now 37-year-old Jamaican is
   looking back, smiling, almost taunting the three men giving chase. The
   race is not over -- and yet it is. The image was a sensation at the
   time and has endured as one of the most indelible of Bolt's career,
   which saw him set his first world record in the 100 at 21. His 2009
   world record in the 100 (9.58 seconds) still stands today. -- Alyssa
   Roenigk

   [greyline.png] [240715_top-100_inlines_010.jpg]

10. Kobe Bryant, basketball

   Key accomplishments: NBA 75th Anniversary team, Basketball Hall of
   Famer, five-time champion, two-time Finals MVP, 2007-08 MVP, 18-time
   All-Star, 15-time All-NBA selection, 12-time All-Defense, four-time
   All-Star Game MVP

   For all of the accomplishments Bryant amassed, the five championships
   chief among them, and all of the otherworldly scoring feats -- nine
   straight 40-point games in 2003, four straight 50-point games in 2007,
   the 81-point night against Toronto, the 60-point send-off against Utah
   -- his lasting achievement was inspiration. The Lakers legend's
   self-described "Mamba mentality" has transcended basketball, and sports
   for that matter, a branded way of life that fans and admirers of Bryant
   aspire to reach. It promises that with enough drive, enough work,
   enough will and enough focus, you too can shape your existence the way
   Bryant did.

   After a horrific helicopter crash in 2020 killed Bryant, his daughter
   Gianna and seven others, Bryant's impact continues to be felt
   posthumously. His name is as relevant as ever in the NBA, with
   countless players paying homage to the shooting guard by wearing Nos. 8
   and 24 and the league renaming the All-Star MVP trophy in his honor.
   "He's like our generation's Jordan," Brooklyn Nets guard Cam Thomas
   told ESPN last season. "How the other guys liked Jordan, that's how we
   are with Kobe." -- Dave McMenamin

11. Novak Djokovic, tennis

   Key accomplishments: 24-time Grand Slam singles champion; record 422
   weeks as No. 1; 375 Grand Slam match wins; third in men's singles
   titles (98), wins (1,110) in Open era

   Less than two months after being stunned in the Wimbledon final by
   Carlos Alcaraz, Djokovic refused to postpone history again and earned
   his record-breaking 24th men's major title at the 2023 US Open. After
   escaping a five-set challenge in the third round, Djokovic didn't lose
   another set and defeated Daniil Medvedev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the
   final. At 36, he became the oldest man to win the US Open, and tied
   Margaret Court's record for the most major titles in history. To many,
   the feat secured his position as the sport's greatest of all time, but,
   like a true competitor, he was far from satisfied. "I don't put any
   number right now in my mind on how many Slams I want to win," he said
   hours later. -- D'Arcy Maine

   [greyline.png] [240715_top-100_inlines_011.jpg]

12. Rafael Nadal, tennis

   Key accomplishments: 22-time Grand Slam singles champion, ATP Tour
   title in 19 straight seasons, 209 weeks as world No. 1, fourth-most
   men's singles wins in Open era

   While Nadal has had success on all surfaces throughout his career, he
   was rightfully deemed the "King of Clay" because of his dominance on
   the dirt. From 2005 to 2007, he had an 81-match win streak on the
   surface -- still the longest stretch on a single surface by any man in
   the Open era. No one in history has won more singles titles at an
   individual Slam than Nadal, the winner of 14 French Open titles, in
   Paris. He has an undefeated record in the final at the tournament, and
   his reign has been so legendary and unprecedented that a statue was
   erected in his honor in 2021 -- while he was still playing at the
   event. Federer called Nadal's supremacy at the French Open "one of the
   greatest achievements in sport." -- D'Arcy Maine

13. Cristiano Ronaldo, soccer

   Key accomplishments: Five-time Ballon d'Or winner, five-time Champions
   League winner, three-time Premier League winner, two-time LaLiga
   winner, two-time Serie A winner, record for most international goals

   Ronaldo's story is one of a supremely talented athlete, but with a
   drive and will to win to match. His career is best summed up by one of
   his own quotes: "If you don't believe you are the best, then you will
   never achieve all that you are capable of." Ronaldo has shown that
   belief throughout more than two decades at the top of world soccer and
   often proved it to be true. "He is the best," said his former Real
   Madrid manager Jose Mourinho. "I saw Maradona a couple of times. I
   never saw Pele. But Cristiano is amazing. This man is the best.
   Cristiano is a goal machine. There will never be another Ronaldo." --

14. Stephen Curry, basketball

   Key accomplishments: NBA 75th Anniversary team, four-time NBA champion,
   2022 Finals MVP, 10-time All-Star, nine-time All-NBA, 2022 All-Star
   Game MVP, two-time scoring leader, career leader in 3-pointers made

   Curry had been reluctant to call himself the greatest shooter of all
   time until he broke the career 3-point scoring record. Once he achieved
   that milestone in December 2021, he wasn't so shy about it anymore.
   Curry has changed the way basketball is played -- at every level of the
   sport. Nowadays you'll find kids in high school gyms going through the
   same pregame shooting routine Curry does. And in the NBA, offenses are
   built around 3-point shooting like never before.

   If the way he revolutionized the game isn't enough to solidify his
   standing in the NBA -- and among great athletes around the world -- his
   résumé is. After winning his first Finals MVP in 2022, to go along with
   his four titles, 10 All-Star appearances, nine All-NBA teams and two
   MVPs, Curry asked: "What are they going to say now?" -- Kendra Andrews

15. Katie Ledecky, swimming

   Key accomplishments: 10-time Olympic medalist, seven-time Olympic gold
   medalist, record 21 world championship gold medals, world records in
   800m free and 1,500m free

   "I was expecting a lot faster." That was Ledecky's response to winning
   the 1,500-meter freestyle by 20 seconds at Olympic trials in June, in
   the fastest time clocked this year. For more than a decade, Ledecky has
   owned the race known as the "swimmer's mile," which was added to the
   Olympic lineup in 2020. The 27-year-old is expected to win gold again
   in Paris, where she is also the favorite in the 400 free, 800 free and
   4x200-meter relay. Since first breaking the world record in the 1,500
   free in 2013, she has shaved 16 seconds off her time while also winning
   more Olympic and world championship gold than any woman in history. --

16. Tim Duncan, basketball

   Key accomplishments: NBA 75th Anniversary team, Basketball Hall of
   Famer, four-time NBA champion, 13-time All-NBA selection, 13-time
   All-Defense, 14-time All-Star, two-time MVP, two-time Finals MVP

   The first 2½ seasons of Duncan's stellar career came before the turn of
   the century, but that didn't stop him from cementing his spot near the
   top of this list. Even without a Rookie of the Year and his first NBA
   title, Duncan's run in the early 2000s banked him both of his MVP
   awards. He earned the first in 2001-02 with a career-best average of
   25.5 points, along with 12.7 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per
   game. The Big Fundamental was also one of the best defenders the league
   has seen, earning his final All-Defensive team nod in 2015 at 38 years
   old. -- Andrew Lopez

17. Shaquille O'Neal, basketball

   Key accomplishments: NBA 75th Anniversary team, Basketball Hall of
   Famer, four-time champion, three-time Finals MVP, 1999-2000 MVP,
   nine-time All-Star, eight-time All-NBA, two-time All-Defense

   When Phil Jackson took a then 27-year-old O'Neal out to dinner during
   training camp ahead of the 1999-2000 Lakers season, the Zen Master
   challenged the center with a lofty objective. "I told him that he
   should make it his goal to be the MVP," Jackson wrote in 2016. "In
   fact, I suggested to him that, by the time he retired, they should
   rename the trophy the Shaq Award!"

   O'Neal went on to win three MVPs during the ensuing campaign: He was
   named co-MVP of the All-Star Game along with Tim Duncan for posting 22
   points, 9 rebounds and 3 blocks in a win for the West; he was
   regular-season MVP after averaging 29.7 points, 13.8 rebounds, 3.8
   assists and 3.0 blocks; and he was NBA Finals MVP after averaging 38
   points on 61.1% shooting, 16.7 rebounds and 2.7 blocks in a six-game
   series win over the Indiana Pacers to capture the first of his three
   titles with the Lakers and four overall. The league never named the
   trophy after O'Neal, but he did pick up the moniker "Most Dominant
   Ever," which isn't a bad consolation prize. -- Dave McMenamin

18. Patrick Mahomes, football

   Key accomplishments: Three-time Super Bowl champion, three-time Super
   Bowl MVP, two-time NFL MVP, two-time First Team All-Pro, six-time Pro
   Bowler

   Mahomes not only had one of the NFL's best passing seasons ever in
   2018, but he did it in his first year as a starter. That season he
   became only the second quarterback to throw for 5,000 yards and 50
   touchdowns, joining the Broncos' Peyton Manning, who did it in 2013.
   Mahomes put himself on a fairly easy pace in both statistical
   categories with a scorching start. He had 13 touchdown passes in the
   first three games and threw for more than 300 yards in eight of the
   first nine. He had two six-TD games that season and hasn't had one
   since. -- Adam Teicher

19. Lewis Hamilton, auto racing

   Key accomplishments: Seven-time Formula One champion (joint record with
   Michael Schumacher), 104 race victories (record), 104 pole positions
   (record), 199 podiums (record)

   He is the most successful driver in Formula One history, but Hamilton's
   story is about so much more than numbers. The first and only Black
   driver to race in F1, Hamilton has described his path to the top as a
   "lonely journey," but continues to commit his energy, time and money to
   increasing diversity in his sport. "I'm winning all of these races, but
   it doesn't actually mean anything unless you do something with the
   platform it provides you," he said after securing his seventh title in
   2020. The next chapter in his remarkable story starts in 2025 when he
   moves to F1's most famous team, Ferrari. -- Laurence Edmondson

20. Aaron Donald, football

   Key accomplishments: 10-time Pro Bowler, eight-time first-team All-Pro,
   three-time Defensive POY (tied for most all time), HOF All-2010s Team,
   2014 Defensive ROY

   Donald went into his eighth NFL season with many significant
   achievements on the field for the Rams: Defensive Rookie of the Year,
   three NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards and seven Pro Bowls to
   start his career. The one thing he was missing? A Super Bowl ring. He
   and the Rams won that during the 2021 season, beating the Cincinnati
   Bengals in a game that went down to the wire. On fourth down in a
   three-point game, Donald pressured Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow and
   forced an incomplete pass to essentially end the game. Donald's
   celebration will be remembered, too: He ran around with his arms
   outstretched and then pointed at his left ring finger, where his first
   Super Bowl ring would go. -- Sarah Barshop

21. Diana Taurasi, basketball

   Key accomplishments: Three-time WNBA champion, two-time Finals MVP,
   five-time Olympic gold medalist, 2009 WNBA MVP, 10-time All-WNBA first
   team, 2004 Rookie of the Year, WNBA's leading career scorer and 3-point
   shooter, three-time NCAA champion, two-time Final Four Most Outstanding
   Player, 2003 Wade Trophy winner

   Taurasi was born in 1982, when the NCAA tournament began for women.
   Twenty years later, she won the first of three consecutive NCAA titles
   with UConn. Now, 22 years after that, she's still going at 42 as the
   oldest active player in the WNBA. The only player in the league to hit
   10,000 points, Taurasi has spent her entire career with the Phoenix
   Mercury and has led the WNBA in scoring five times. Playing in her
   sixth Olympics this summer, she is revered for her longtime leadership
   of Team USA as well as the Mercury, and for her unwavering swagger. --

22. Sidney Crosby, hockey

   Key accomplishments: NHL 100 Greatest, two-time Richard Trophy,
   two-time Ross Trophy, two-time Hart Trophy, three-time Lindsay Award,
   three-time Stanley Cup champion (two-time Conn Smythe), 1,596 points
   (10th all time)

   Crosby's teammate Kris Letang recalled how, in Game 6 of the Stanley
   Cup Final against the San Jose Sharks, Crosby vowed that he and Letang
   would team up on the "biggest goal" of the night. They wound up
   connecting for a game winner that secured Pittsburgh's fourth Cup in
   franchise history. Letang was understandably stunned by Crosby's
   fortune-telling prowess on such a large stage. But Crosby impresses in
   the smaller moments, too. Former linemate Conor Sheary recalled Crosby
   assuring him when they were paired together that Sheary was "there for
   a reason and to play my game." It was the sort of calming presence
   Sheary needed from Crosby and a gesture he has never forgotten. --

23. Kevin Garnett, basketball

   Key accomplishments: NBA 75th Anniversary team, Basketball Hall of
   Famer, 2008 NBA champion, 2003-04 MVP, 2007-08 Defensive Player of the
   Year, 13-time All-Star, 12-time All-Defense team, eight-time All-NBA
   selection, 2003 All-Star Game MVP

   Garnett was famously loyal to Minnesota, leading the Timberwolves to
   their first playoff series victories when he piloted them to the 2004
   Western Conference finals. But despite winning his lone MVP award that
   season, it was in Boston where he would cement himself in history. He
   and Ray Allen teamed up with Paul Pierce to usher in a new big three
   era in the NBA and lead the Celtics to the 2008 title, plus another NBA
   Finals appearance two seasons later. Garnett bellowing "Anything is
   possible!" in the aftermath of the Celtics' Game 6 victory over their
   archrivals, the Los Angeles Lakers, has become an indelible
   championship moment. -- Tim Bontemps

   World Series champion, 703 HR (fourth)

   They called him The Machine. Pujols' swing was direct and to the point:
   power emanating from his lower half, firing through hands he used with
   the precision of a surgeon, his bat a weapon that placed him among the
   game's greatest right-handed hitters ever. Rogers Hornsby, Hank Aaron,
   Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio, Albert Pujols. He belongs. A 13th-round
   draft pick who will be a first-ballot Hall of Famer in 2028, Pujols'
   lone ding is an end-of-career fade with the Angels. In 12 seasons with
   the Cardinals, he was undeniable. -- Jeff Passan

25. Floyd Mayweather, boxing

   Key accomplishments: 50-0 record (27 KOs) from 1996 to 2017,
   five-division world champion, longtime pound-for-pound No. 1

   Mayweather won world titles in five weight classes and dominated the
   pound-for-pound rankings from 2005 to 2015. His immaculate defense,
   with a trademark shoulder roll technique to block punches, along with
   sublime footwork, blurring hand speed and pinpoint accuracy helped him
   beat the best of his era -- Manny Pacquiao, Oscar De La Hoya, Canelo
   Alvarez, Miguel Cotto, Ricky Hatton and Juan Manuel Marquez, among
   others.

   His decision win over Pacquiao generated more than $600 million in 2015
   and remains the biggest fight in decades. Mayweather's bout against
   former MMA champion Conor McGregor in 2017 also generated more than
   $600 million, second most all time. Mayweather's wealth of boxing
   talent made him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2012, 2014, 2015
   and 2018 (according to Forbes). -- Nick Parkinson

   ESPN's Top 100 Athletes: Randy Moss

   Check out the athletic feats of Randy Moss, one of the greatest NFL

   the past 25 years.

26. Peyton Manning, football

   Key accomplishments: Hall of Famer (2021), two-time Super Bowl
   champion, five-time NFL MVP (most all time), 14-time Pro Bowler,
   seven-time First Team All-Pro.

   Manning already had a Hall of Fame career when he arrived in Denver in
   2012 -- 11 Pro Bowl selections, five first-team All-Pro selections,
   nine 4,000-yard passing seasons and a Super Bowl win in his 14 years
   with the Colts. He signed with the Broncos after a missed season in
   2011, his fourth neck surgery and a bit of uncertainty about whether
   physically he could play at the level he wished. His four years in
   Denver answered those questions with four AFC West titles, two Super
   Bowl trips and a Super Bowl win.

   His masterpiece might have been the 2013 season, when the Broncos broke
   the league's scoring record with 606 points and Manning set records
   with 5,477 passing yards and 55 touchdowns, including seven in the
   season opener. The Broncos topped 40 points six times and 50 points
   three times. Current Dolphins associate head coach and former Broncos
   assistant Eric Studesville said: "I've never seen anything like Peyton
   and those guys that year. I don't think anybody has. That was just an
   all-time great with the ball in his hands doing all-time great things
   at a level nobody else has been to.'' -- Jeff Legwold

27. Randy Moss, football

   Key accomplishments: Hall of Famer (2018), six-time Pro Bowler,
   four-time First Team All-Pro, 156 career TD receptions (second all
   time).

   At 6-foot-4 and with a 47-inch vertical jump, Moss could reach or jump
   over the tallest defensive backs who tried to cover him -- hence the
   phrase "You got Mossed." But with speed that was measured below 4.3
   seconds in the 40 during a private workout before the 1998 draft, Moss
   also could run away from the fastest defenders, be it on deep routes or
   even on what would now be called "bubble screens." Other factors
   contributed to his success as well, but the league had never before
   seen a player like Moss. -- Kevin Seifert

28. Nikola Jokic, basketball

   Key accomplishments: 2023 NBA champion, 2023 Finals MVP, three-time
   MVP, six-time All-Star, five-time All-NBA selection, 2023 Western
   Conference finals MVP.

   Before the Clippers would blow a 3-1 lead in the second round against
   Denver inside the bubble in 2020, Doc Rivers was asked who Jokic
   reminded him most of. Rivers couldn't pick just one legendary big man.
   "He has all the footwork and the moves of an [Hakeem] Olajuwon," Rivers
   said. "The lanky and goofy intelligence of Kevin McHale. ... He's the
   best passing big that I've seen, I think, ever. [And] I know [Bill]
   Walton was one of [the best ever]." Rivers might have actually
   undersold Jokic. This was before the Nuggets superstar won three MVP
   awards, a championship and a Finals MVP. At 29, Jokic continues to
   annually put up numbers the league hasn't seen from a big man since
   Wilt Chamberlain, and he's far from done. -- Ohm Youngmisuk

29. Michael Schumacher, auto racing

   Key accomplishments: Seven-time Formula One champion (joint record with
   Hamilton), 91 race victories, 68 pole positions, 155 podiums (all
   second all time).

   "The toughest rival I ever had," Fernando Alonso said of Schumacher,
   voicing a feeling shared by most who raced against him. At the start of
   the new millennium Schumacher had no equal. Ruthless and unforgiving on
   track, his passion and drive off it helped turn Ferrari into the most
   dominant team F1 had ever seen. The combination of his generational
   racing talent and his blinding desire to win at all costs made him
   enthralling and controversial in equal measure and helped him end a
   21-year wait for a championship at Ferrari, winning five straight to
   kick off the 2000s. -- Nate Saunders

30. Mike Trout, baseball

   Key accomplishments: Three-time MVP (tied for second most all time),
   11-time All-Star, nine-time Silver Slugger, 2012 AL Rookie of The Year,
   active career leader in WAR (86.1 per Baseball-Reference).

   Only three hitters have piled up more WAR since the century began than
   Trout, and all of them had more than a decade head start on him when he
   launched, fully formed, into the majors at age 19, two years after
   going 25th in the 2009 draft. That's how quickly Trout leaped into the
   conversation about the game's historical elite. As perhaps the first
   star whose greatness was sharpened by contemporary analytics, Trout's
   all-around dominance was on display from the start.

   At 32, Trout has won three MVP awards and finished in the top five of
   balloting seven other times. Injuries have slowed his momentum, but if
   Trout can string together a few more healthy campaigns, the kid from
   Millville, New Jersey, could yet transcend his status as the best of
   his generation and challenge for the crown of best ever, period. --

   Key accomplishments: Three-time Cy Young winner, 2014 MVP, 10-time
   All-Star, five ERA titles, Triple Crown winner, Gold Glove winner, 2020
   World Series champion, no-hitter in 2014.

   Early in the 2016 season, then-San Francisco Giants ace Madison
   Bumgarner said of his great West Coast rival: "Are we watching the best
   ever at his best?" Maybe so. During his peak from 2011 to 2017, Kershaw
   went 118-41 with a 2.10 ERA. Even as he has battled injuries, he has
   remained effective: His career 2.48 ERA is the lowest for a starting
   pitcher since 1920 and his winning percentage is the highest since 1900
   for a pitcher with 2,000 innings. The Los Angeles Dodgers lefty has
   never been the hardest thrower, but he is a perfectionist who once went
   nearly four seasons without allowing a home run on his curveball. --

   Key accomplishments: Six-time FIFA World Player of the Year, Brazil's
   top goal scorer all time, record World Cup goal scorer, Golden Ball
   winner at 2007 Women's World Cup, Golden Boot winner at 2007 Women's
   World Cup.

   There might be a temptation for Marta to stay on for one last crack at
   the World Cup on home ground in 2027, but as it stands the Paris
   Olympics will be her last try at a world title with the Brazilian
   national team. Not having such an honor does not put the slightest dent
   in her legacy. Marta is quite simply the most important player in the
   history of women's soccer. There will never be another Marta. Gliding
   past opponents, beating keepers with a wand of a left foot, Marta came
   from nowhere -- a poor family in a remote part of Brazil -- to
   legitimize the sport in places where it struggled to be taken
   seriously. The inspirer of millions of dreams, the one who showed that
   the women's game can be an art form. -- Tim Vickery

   Key accomplishments: Two-time MVP (2012-13, last player to win
   consecutive MVPs), Triple Crown winner in 2012, 12-time All-Star,
   seven-time Silver Slugger, four batting titles, 2003 World Series
   champion.

   Cabrera arrived in the major leagues at 20, found himself batting
   cleanup in the World Series, whacked an opposite-field home run off
   Roger Clemens and charted a course that would end two decades later
   with 3,174 hits. Cabrera's spray chart was a thing of beauty, with dots
   denoting his hits in all corners of the stadium -- and 511 over the
   fence. He managed to hit for power without sacrificing his innate
   bat-to-ball skill, and he peaked in 2012, when he became the first
   hitter in 45 years to win batting, home run and RBI titles in the same
   season. -- Jeff Passan

34. Tamika Catchings, basketball

   Key accomplishments: 2012 WNBA champion and Finals MVP, four-time
   Olympic gold medalist, 2011 WNBA MVP, five-time WNBA Defensive Player
   of the Year, 10-time WNBA All-Defensive first team, seven-time All-WNBA
   First Team, WNBA career steals leader, 2002 WNBA Rookie of the Year,
   Basketball Hall of Famer.

   Skilled as Catchings was, she is likely remembered for her motor more
   than any other great women's basketball player. That's evident in her
   constant presence on WNBA All-Defensive teams. Catchings was the No. 3
   draft pick in 2001 because she was coming off a knee injury that cut
   short her senior season at Tennessee. She sat out that WNBA season but
   rewarded the Indiana Fever for their patience by becoming the face of
   the franchise. Nothing shows Catchings' impact more than this: The
   Fever missed the playoffs just twice in her 15-season career but
   haven't been back to the postseason since she retired in 2016. --

35. Dwyane Wade, basketball

   Key accomplishments: NBA 75th Anniversary team, Basketball Hall of
   Famer, three-time NBA champion, 2006 Finals MVP, 13-time All-Star,
   eight-time All-NBA selection, three-time All-Defense, 2010 All-Star
   Game MVP.

   Who could forget that four-game Finals run Wade had? He averaged 30
   points, 8 rebounds and 4 assists on 60% shooting ... in the 2011 NBA
   Finals the Miami Heat lost to the Dallas Mavericks. The brilliance of
   Wade's career was perhaps dimmed a tad because he teamed up with LeBron
   James and Chris Bosh at the peak of his powers. And the 2011 Finals
   will always be remembered for James' stumbles and not Wade's singular
   brilliance that was essentially wasted. But his career was spectacular
   and his 2006 Finals four-game run -- 39.3 points and 8.3 rebounds on
   50% shooting (and 73 free throws) -- to lead the Heat to the first of
   three titles is legendary.

   In the two seasons before James arrived in Miami, Wade won the scoring
   title and twice finished in the top five of the MVP voting. He
   willingly took a step back for James, an act that undoubtedly helped
   the Heat jell and win back-to-back titles even if it meant the end of
   his time at the top of those lists. It was a team-first act he paired
   with a willingness to come off the bench in the 2008 Olympics for the
   Redeem Team. He still stands as one of the greatest shooting guards of
   all time, the best shot-blocking guard in NBA history and a
   flag-carrying member of the iconic 2003 draft class. -- Brian Windhorst

36. Maya Moore, basketball

   Key accomplishments: Four-time WNBA champion, two-time Olympic gold
   medalist, 2014 WNBA MVP, 2013 Finals MVP, five-time All-WNBA First
   Team, 2011 WNBA Rookie of the Year, two-time NCAA champion, 2010 Final
   Four Most Outstanding Player, three-time Wade Trophy winner.

   Moore was part of a 90-game winning streak and two perfect seasons at
   UConn. Then as the WNBA's No. 1 pick in 2011, she helped the Minnesota
   Lynx become a dynasty. Moore was known for her smooth shot, her clutch
   play and the fact that winning followed wherever she went. In six of
   her eight WNBA seasons, the Lynx reached the Finals. But Moore's career
   ended before expected as she stopped playing at age 29 following the
   2018 season to focus on social justice issues. She worked tirelessly to
   help free her future husband, Jonathan Irons, whose prison conviction
   was reversed in 2020. Moore officially retired in January 2023. --

37. Ichiro Suzuki, baseball

   Key accomplishments: 2001 AL Rookie of the Year and AL MVP, 10-time
   All-Star, 10-time Gold Glove Award winner, AL batting titles in 2001
   and 2004.

   His most famous play is his "Star Wars" throw from his rookie season.
   His most famous record is the 262 hits he registered in 2004. He was 27
   when he came to Seattle and he still finished with more than 3,000 hits
   -- indeed, more career hits, if you include his Japanese totals, than
   Pete Rose. The iconic Ichiro hit starts with the pull of the sleeve in
   the batter's box, the bat held high in front of him, then comes
   outracing the ball to first base. "No single number could ever explain
   a human as thrilling, as unusual, and as wonderful as Ichiro," wrote
   sports columnist Joe Posnanski. -- David Schoenfield

38. Barry Bonds, baseball

   Key accomplishments: Since Jan. 1, 2000: 317 home runs (MLB-record 73
   in 2001), 1,128 walks, four consecutive MVPs (2001-04), six-time
   All-Star, five-time Silver Slugger, two batting titles.

   Bonds is the best living baseball player, and never was he better than
   the eight seasons he played this century. In that time, he smashed the
   single-season home run record, got on base at a 51.7% clip -- a figure
   last reached in an individual year by Ted Williams in 1957 -- and came
   as close as anyone to mastering the art of hitting. Bonds' steroid use
   has kept him out of the Hall of Fame, but those who witnessed him play
   know: 21st-century Bonds was the closest we've seen to Babe Ruth. --

39. Kevin Durant, basketball

   Key accomplishments: NBA 75th Anniversary team, two-time champion,
   two-time Finals MVP, 14-time All-Star, two-time All-Star Game MVP,
   2013-14 MVP, 10-time All-NBA, four-time scoring leader, 2007-08 Rookie
   of the Year.

   "I'm Kevin Durant. You know who I am. Y'all know who I am." That was
   Durant's conclusion to a lengthy answer about pesky Patrick Beverley's
   defense against him (with a whole lot of help, as Durant noted) early
   in a 2019 playoff series. Durant's point: He had proved himself as one
   of the best scorers to ever play the game, a four-time scoring champion
   who had won the previous two NBA Finals MVPs, a blend of size and skill
   that had never been seen before. Then he averaged 41.5 points the rest
   of that series as the Warriors finished off the Clippers. As he has
   bounced from team to team, there has been one constant about KD's
   identity: When he's healthy, he has always been impossible to guard. --

40. Justin Verlander, baseball

   Key accomplishments: 2011 AL MVP, three-time Cy Young winner, nine-time
   All-Star, two-time World Series champion, 2006 AL Rookie of the Year,
   top 15 in career strikeouts, three no-hitters.

   Will Verlander be baseball's last 300-game winner? He'll have to coax
   40 more wins out of his Hall of Fame-bound arm, but if it's ever going
   to happen again, it'll be Verlander who does it. A true throwback to
   the days when ace pitchers held sway in the big leagues, Verlander has
   combined dominance and durability in a way that harkens back to the
   days of Tom Seaver, Bob Gibson and Nolan Ryan. With 260 wins and
   3,300-plus strikeouts under his belt and more on the way, this is what
   Verlander always wanted to be. "I love being a pitcher," Verlander said
   in 2018. "When I first started playing baseball, I always envisioned
   myself as a pitcher. I idolized Nolan Ryan, that old-school grit." --

41. Dirk Nowitzki, basketball

   Key accomplishments: NBA 75th anniversary team, Basketball Hall of
   Famer, 2011 NBA champion, 2011 Finals MVP, 2006-07 MVP, 14-time
   All-Star, 12-time All-NBA selection.

   Nowitzki revolutionized the way the NBA game is played, a pioneer as a
   sweet-shooting 7-footer who thrived as a perimeter threat. But the big
   German is best remembered for an iconic post move he developed midway
   through his career. It was his most lethal weapon when Nowitzki
   shattered "soft Euro" stereotypes by leading the Dallas Mavericks to
   their lone title. His one-legged fadeaway is captured on the statue
   that stands outside the American Airlines Center and has the
   inscription "Loyalty never fades away" -- a nod to Nowitzki's
   record-setting 21-year run with one franchise. "The Dirk fade," as it's
   commonly called, is recreated by stars throughout the league on a
   regular basis. -- Tim MacMahon

42. Giannis Antetokounmpo, basketball

   Key accomplishments: NBA 75th anniversary team, 2021 NBA champion, 2021
   Finals MVP, two-time MVP, 2019-20 Defensive Player of the Year,
   eight-time All-Star, 2021 All-Star Game MVP, seven-time All-NBA
   selection, five-time All-Defense, 2016-17 Most Improved Player.

   When the Milwaukee Bucks selected a skinny kid from Greece who had been
   playing basketball for only two years with the 15th pick in the 2013
   draft, it was impossible to predict how his arrival would alter the
   franchise's trajectory for the next decade. Antetokounmpo transformed
   himself from an unknown but promising prospect into one of the most
   dominant power forwards in history at both ends of the floor --
   culminating in a 50-point game in the 2021 NBA Finals to clinch the
   franchise's first championship in 50 years. The fact that he ordered 50
   chicken nuggets the next day to celebrate only endeared him to
   Milwaukee fans even more. -- Jamal Collier

43. Alex Rodriguez, baseball

   Key accomplishments: Since Jan. 1, 2000: Three-time AL MVP (2003, 2005,
   2007), 11-time All-Star, seven-time Silver Slugger, 2009 World Series
   champion, 548 HR (second most since 2000).

   A-Rod helped usher in the golden era of the jumbo-sized shortstop, a
   position long reserved for skilled fielders who couldn't hit. A gifted
   batsman, Rodriguez mashed for power and average to all fields. His
   abundance of talent was unassailable. He also drew the longest steroid
   suspension in baseball history, coloring his achievements and cooking
   his reputation. History will see Rodriguez as one of the most talented
   players ever, but as is the case with all performance-enhancing drug
   users, the distinction comes with an invisible asterisk. -- Jeff Passan

44. Mikaela Shiffrin, skiing

   Key accomplishments: Three-time Olympic medalist, two-time Olympic gold
   medalist, record 96 World Cup wins, 59 World Cup slalom victories (most
   in a single discipline).

   On March 11, 2023, Shiffrin chased down a record that, for 34 years,
   consumed the minds and careers of countless ski racers and became the
   winningest alpine skier in history. She won her 87th World Cup race
   that day, eclipsing the longstanding record held by Swedish legend
   Ingemar Stenmark, which many considered to be unbreakable. She did it,
   of course, quickly, reaching 87 wins nearly three years quicker than
   Stenmark and by winning at least one race in all six World Cup
   disciplines -- the only woman or man ever to do so.

   But what's most remarkable about Shiffrin's feat is that she won 24
   races and two of her five World Cup overall titles after skiing the
   most disappointing races of her career at the 2022 Beijing Olympics and
   having people question whether her best years were behind her. --

45. David Ortiz, baseball

   Key accomplishments: Since Jan. 1, 2000: Hall of Famer, three-time
   World Series champion, 2013 World Series MVP, 10-time All-Star,
   seven-time Silver Slugger, 531 HR (third most since 2000).

   Above everything, Big Papi will be remembered for feasting in the
   biggest of moments. As the game's greatest designated hitter, Ortiz had
   Cooperstown numbers -- 541 career homers and a .931 OPS -- but that's
   only the tip of Papi's boisterous iceberg. He had 17 career playoff
   homers as part of three championship Boston Red Sox clubs and hit .455
   over 14 World Series games. That includes 2013, when, at age 37, he
   went 11-for-16 with two homers and eight walks in the Fall Classic
   against a St. Louis Cardinals team that could not get him out.

   After Ortiz was elected to the Hall of Fame, longtime teammate Dustin
   Pedroia said of him, "From day one, in a big moment, everything was in
   slow motion. He found a way to come through in moments where you dream
   of as a kid. He did it every single time." -- Bradford Doolittle

46. Max Scherzer, baseball

   Key accomplishments: Three-time Cy Young winner, two-time World Series
   champion, eight-time All-Star, top 10 all time in strikeouts, threw two
   no-hitters in 2015.

   Scherzer pitched the most dominant back-to-back games in MLB history.
   On June 14, 2015, he pitched a 16-strikeout one-hitter, allowing only a
   bloop single. In his next start, he lost a perfect game when he hit the
   27th batter. He has had a record-tying 20-strikeout game, postseason
   heroics and one of the greatest months ever in June 2019 (6-0, 1.00
   ERA, 68 strikeouts) -- which he accomplished with a broken nose. He
   threw 98 mph while mixing in four other pitches. Most of all, though,
   the lasting image will be his intensity, notably his stomping around on
   the mound after recording another strikeout. -- David Schoenfield

47. Jimmie Johnson, auto racing

   Key accomplishments: Seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion (tied for
   most all time with Dale Earnhardt and Richard Petty), only driver to
   win five straight titles (2006-10).

   The challenge when it comes to covering Johnson's career is having to
   continuously find new ways to express, "Hey y'all, this guy, he's
   really great at racing stock cars, isn't he?!" And that's only the
   second-best compliment I can give to the man who won seven NASCAR Cup
   Series titles, equaling Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt, including
   five in a row, a mark of which The King and The Intimidator never came
   close.

   But Johnson's most mind-bending accomplishment is that he won those
   Cups even as the system that awarded them was seemingly and repeatedly
   rigged against him. The paddock called it "Jimmie Proofing" as his
   septet of titles were earned via three different points systems and
   four postseason format variations, all while steering three wildly
   different generations of race cars. Meanwhile, he somehow has remained
   true to his SoCal desert town, trailer park roots -- as kind and humble
   as he was fast and unbeatable. -- Ryan McGee

48. Thierry Henry, soccer

   Key accomplishments: 2000 Euros winner, two-time Premier League winner,
   LaLiga winner, two-time FA Cup winner, Champions League winner, Copa
   del Rey winner, Club World Cup winner.

   Henry revolutionized the role of the No. 9 in soccer. Tall, quick,
   physical, intelligent, determined, arrogant and charismatic, he
   represented a new kind among strikers. One of the greatest sportsmen of
   his generation, he won pretty much everything possible and scored
   unforgettable goals during his career. But his most amazing feat is
   undoubtedly going the whole Premier League season unbeaten with Arsenal
   in 2004. He was outstanding in that campaign, leading his team to an
   achievement never repeated since in modern English football.

   "I believe Thierry was on the same level as Pele and Maradona,
   definitely. He was an exceptional football player, but as well a
   combination of a modern player, huge physical talent, technical talent,
   but as well special intelligence. He was one of the greatest players
   I've ever seen," his former coach Arsène Wenger said. -- Julien Laurens

   Reina winner, six-time Champions League winner, two-time Champions
   League final MVP, World Cup winner, World Cup final MVP, World Cup
   Golden Ball, Ballon d'Or winner, the Best FIFA Women's Player winner.

   Bonmatí's 2022-23 campaign is unrivaled in women's soccer. She won the
   top prizes in club and international football -- the Champions League
   with Barcelona and the World Cup with Spain -- and was named the MVP in
   both finals. She's a midfielder who can do everything: dictate games,
   beat players, create chances and score. That success with Barça and
   Spain saw her crowned the best player in the world as she was awarded
   both the Ballon d'Or trophy and named the Best FIFA Women's Player for
   the first time in her career. -- Sam Marsden

50. Zinedine Zidane, soccer

   Key accomplishments: European Championship winner, Champions League
   winner, LaLiga winner, Intercontinental Cup winner.

   Zidane transformed soccer into a form of art. His elegance with the
   ball, his incredible technical ability and his skills made him a
   magician. He will also be remembered forever for netting two goals in
   the 1998 World Cup final, of course, but probably even more for scoring
   the most beautiful goal in a Champions League final ever. His volley
   with Real Madrid against Bayer Leverkusen in 2002 was the purest you
   will ever see, and with his weak foot as well.

   "Playing alongside him was just incredible. There were games where
   opponents could not get close to him, could not get the ball off him.
   The ball used to be glued to feet. Even at training, he would be
   unplayable at times!" his former teammate Robert Pires said. -- Julien

51. Steve Nash, basketball

   Key accomplishments: NBA 75th Anniversary team, Basketball Hall of
   Famer, two-time MVP, eight-time All-Star, seven-time All-NBA, five-time
   assists leader.

   Before words like "efficiency" and "pace" became as common part of the
   NBA parlance as "slam dunk" and "pick-and-roll," there was a diminutive
   guard from Canada who, as a contemporary of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille
   O'Neal in the late 1990s through early 2000s, ended up with as many
   regular-season MVPs as the two of them combined. Under the
   revolutionary tutelage of coach Mike D'Antoni with the Phoenix Suns,
   Nash won the award in 2005 and 2006 as the point guard on the heralded
   "7 Seconds or Less" teams that made it to three Western Conference
   finals in six years. While Nash never won a ring, he maximized his
   talents as a 6-foot-3 point guard, shooting 50% overall, 40% from 3 and
   90% from the free throw line in four seasons and leading the league in
   assists five times. -- Dave McMenamin

   Key accomplishments: Since Jan. 1, 2000: five-time Gold Glove winner,
   two-time Platinum Glove winner, four-time All-Star, 455 HRs in career
   (fifth most since 2000); Hall of Famer.

   The lore of Beltre has grown since his retirement following the 2018
   season and placed him alongside Mike Schmidt and Brooks Robinson among
   the game's best third basemen. No one at third played more games than
   Beltre, a testament to his willingness to grit through pain. He manned
   the position with grace and consistency, two tenets that apply to the
   rest of his game. Beltre's counting stats never screamed superstar, he
   never won an MVP and his allergy to walks limited his ceiling. But
   that's all ancillary to the truth of who Adrian Beltre was: the
   ultimate ballplayer's ballplayer. -- Jeff Passan

53. Derek Jeter, baseball

   Key accomplishments: Since Jan. 1, 2000: two-time World Series champ,
   2000 World Series MVP, Hall of Famer, 2,658 hits (fifth-most since
   2000), 141 postseason hits (most since 2000), 12-time All-Star.

   Few players have had as many iconic moments: The Jeffrey Maier home run
   last century, the flip, the dive, Mr. November, the home run for hit
   No. 3,000, the walk-off single in his final game. He did it all in the
   pressure cooker of New York, playing for the sport's most fabled
   franchise. Jeter's legend cannot be separated from the pinstripes he
   wore: Before he joined the Yankees, they hadn't won a World Series in
   18 years; with him, they won five. He has been retired 10 years now and
   we still hear Yankee Stadium PA announcer Bob Sheppard: "Now batting
   for the Yankees ... No. 2 ... Derek ... Jeter." -- David Schoenfield

54. Alex Ovechkin, hockey

   Key accomplishments: NHL 100 Greatest, Stanley Cup champion (Conn
   Smythe), second all time with 853 goals, NHL-record 312 power-play
   goals, nine-time Richard Trophy, three-time Hart Trophy and Lindsay
   Award, 2006 Calder Trophy, 2008 Art Ross Trophy.

   There isn't a player in the NHL who has commanded a slap shot like
   Ovechkin in his career. Even if Father Time has begun catching up in
   some areas, the pure power behind his signature shot remains.
   Ovechkin's success scoring 853 goals (to date) has come in large part
   because of how he uses a big frame (6-foot-2) to add velocity and power
   behind a shot that can exceed 100 mph. When Ovechkin puts his weight
   behind a puck -- particularly from his favorite right-circle spot --
   it's a howitzer for any goalie to stop. No wonder so many have failed
   to keep Ovi from lighting the lamp. -- Kristen Shilton

   Key accomplishments: Ballon d'Or winner, six-time Champions League

   most-capped player, joint-most trophies won with Real Madrid.

   "I'd like to ask you to never retire." As news conference questions go,
   it was unconventional, but the Italian journalist's plea -- after
   Modrić's Croatia was eliminated from Euro 2024 -- was met with
   applause, echoing the sentiment. Everybody loves Modrić. "As well as
   being a top player, one of the best in the world, he's even more
   spectacular as a person," Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. More
   than any other player, Modrić was fundamental in creating Madrid's
   relentless winning culture over the past decade. There's no one
   standout moment -- bar, perhaps, leading underdogs Croatia to a World
   Cup final in 2018 -- but rather year after year of consistent
   excellence. -- Alex Kirkland

   Reina winner, three-time Champions League winner, Champions League
   Player of the Season winner, World Cup winner, two-time Ballon d'Or
   winner, two-time The Best FIFA Women's Player winner.

   Putellas' career has been a battle on and off the pitch. On the pitch,
   she has transformed Spanish soccer, playing a part in Barça winning
   three Champions Leagues in four years and Spain becoming world
   champions. Off the pitch, she led the fight against the Spanish
   Football Federation for improved working conditions. She has become an
   icon in Barcelona, where her image has filled huge advertising boards
   in the city centre, and she is known as La Reina. "She is the captain
   and the queen of Barcelona for a reason," teammate Lucy Bronze said
   after Putellas' goal in the 2024 Champions League final. "She showed
   today why she is a back-to-back Ballon d'Or winner." -- Sam Marsden

57. Calvin Johnson, football

   Key accomplishments: Hall of Famer, six-time Pro Bowler, three-time
   first-team All-Pro, HOF All-2010s Team, single-season receiving yards
   record.

   Known as Megatron, Johnson was at the peak of his powers in 2012.
   That's when he set an NFL single-season record with 1,964 receiving
   yards, breaking Jerry Rice's record of 1,848 that had stood since 1985.
   "It was an unbelievable thing to play with a guy like that. I think
   from day one, I knew that I was throwing to a Hall of Famer as long as
   he stayed healthy," Matthew Stafford, Johnson's quarterback during the
   receiver's last seven seasons with the Detroit Lions, told ESPN in
   2021. "He was a special player and a great person, a great teammate."
   At 6-foot-5 and 237 pounds, Johnson possessed a 42½-inch vertical leap
   that allowed him to outjump defenders in video game fashion. -- Eric

   All-Pro, three-time Defensive POY (tied for most all-time), HOF
   All-2010s Team, only player with 20-plus sacks in multiple seasons.

   Watt won three NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards in his career,
   but his most dominant season came in 2014. He had 20.5 sacks, the
   second time he'd done that in his career, as well as 59 solo tackles,
   29 tackles for loss, four forced fumbles and an 80-yard interception
   return for a touchdown. Watt had another defensive touchdown that
   season, and he had three offensive touchdowns. He won his second NFL
   Defensive Player of the Year award that season and finished second to
   quarterback Aaron Rodgers in MVP voting. Watt received 13 of 50 MVP
   votes that season, the most by a defender since Lawrence Taylor won the
   award in 1986. -- Sarah Barshop

   Series winner, 11-time All-Star, 523 saves and 29 postseason saves
   (both most since 2000).

   Rivera was inevitability personified. Thriving in baseball's most
   mercurial of roles -- the ninth-inning reliever -- he emerged from the
   bullpen to the pounding tones of Metallica's "Enter Sandman" night
   after night, year after year. Every time he did so, dread-filled
   Yankees opponents knew the bell was tolling -- for them. Armed with one
   pitch -- a cutter that righty hitters waved at and lefty hitters could
   not barrel up -- Rivera became New York's closer in 1997 and never put
   up anything but stellar seasons on his way to a 2.21 lifetime ERA and
   record 652 saves. For all of that, he was better than anyone in the
   postseason, posting a 0.70 ERA and 42 saves over 96 playoff games. --

   First Team, 2008 WNBA Rookie of the Year, 2020 WNBA Defensive Player of
   the Year, two-time NCAA champion, two-time Final Four Most Outstanding
   Player, 2007 Wade Trophy winner.

   Parker was known for being able to play any position, but at 6-foot-4
   she was lethal as a post player with a diverse skill set. In college,
   Parker led Tennessee to coach Pat Summitt's last two NCAA titles, in
   2007 and 2008. The No. 1 WNBA draft pick by the Sparks in 2008, Parker
   had an epic first pro season: She was MVP and Rookie of the Year (no
   other player has done that) and won Olympic gold. She spent 13 of her
   16 WNBA seasons with the Sparks, but won WNBA titles with Los Angeles,
   Chicago and Las Vegas. -- Michael Voepel

61. Ray Lewis, football

   Key accomplishments: Hall of Famer (2018), 12-time Pro Bowler,
   eight-time first-team All-Pro, only player with 40 sacks and 30
   interceptions since sacks became official in 1982.

   Lewis redefined the middle linebacker position as a three-down defender
   who made plays from sideline to sideline. His ability to make teammates
   around him better established a storied tradition of defense in
   Baltimore. From 2000 to '12, the Ravens' defense ranked among the top
   three in the NFL in seven of the 10 seasons in which Lewis played at
   least six games. "Before we get to his play, Ray is the greatest leader
   in team sports history," said Shannon Sharpe, a Hall of Fame tight end
   who won a Super Bowl with Lewis in 2000. "No one is even close." --

62. Shohei Ohtani, baseball

   Key accomplishments: Two-time MVP, 2018 Rookie of the Year, three-time
   All-Star, two 40-HR seasons, 38-19 record as pitcher (3.01 career ERA),
   top-five Cy Young finish.

   When ESPN runs the sequel to this exercise in 2050, Ohtani is the
   likeliest candidate from baseball to rate worthy of the top 10. His
   first seven years in MLB have been transcendent. What before him was
   taken as fact -- that nobody can hit and pitch at a high enough level
   to warrant doing both -- is now null. Ohtani arrived from Japan with a
   freighter of hype and only exceeded it, stretching the definition of
   what a baseball player can be. "Shohei," Dodgers president of baseball
   operations Andrew Friedman said, "is arguably the most talented player
   who's ever played this game." -- Jeff Passan

63. Allyson Felix, track

   Key accomplishments: 11-time Olympic medalist, seven-time Olympic gold
   medalist, record 18-time world championship medalist.

   Five Olympics. Eleven medals. Greatest U.S. runner in Olympic history.
   But a closer look at Felix's seven Olympic gold medals reveals another
   side to her success. In a sport defined by individual success, she
   might also be the greatest teammate in history. Felix won six of her
   seven Olympic gold medals as part of relays: two in the 4x100 meters
   and four in the 4x400. Her only individual gold came at the 2012 London
   Games in the 200 meters after taking silver in the previous two
   Olympics. That Felix experienced so much of her success while
   supporting her teammates comes as no surprise.

   In the years since she retired from the sport, she has been an
   outspoken advocate for Black women's maternal health care and pay
   equity and protections for women athletes after childbirth. -- Alyssa

64. Mia Hamm, soccer

   Key accomplishments: Two-time World Cup winner, two-time Olympic gold
   medalist, two-time NCAA Division I champion, three-time ESPYS winner,
   U.S. Soccer Hall of Famer.

   Hamm is perhaps the first global superstar to emerge out of women's
   soccer, and she was a reluctant one at that. But on the field, in
   contrast, she played with the confidence and killer instinct you'd
   expect from one of the world's greatest goal scorers. She had a knack
   for exceptional ball control and precision in her shots. That's why she
   still is the No. 2 goals leader for the USWNT, with 158 international
   goals. -- Caitlin Murray

65. Kylian Mbappé, soccer

   Key accomplishments: World Cup winner, seven-time Ligue 1 winner,
   four-time French Cup winner.

   Currently the best soccer player in the world, Mbappé has followed the
   path of an absolute prodigy of the game. He made his professional debut
   at 16, scored his first goal at 17, played for France at 18 and won the
   World Cup at 19! His move from PSG to Real Madrid this summer will take
   him to new heights and will strengthen even more his status as the heir
   of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.

   In 2018, he took the world by storm and became the second teenager in
   history alongside Pelé to score in a World Cup final. In 2022, he made
   more World Cup history with his hat trick in the World Cup final loss
   against Argentina. "He is just a phenomenon. He is such a generational
   talent. You just don't see many players like him. He is only 25, but
   his career is already amazing," Thierry Henry said about his
   compatriot. -- Julien Laurens

66. Jon Jones, MMA

   Key accomplishments: UFC light heavyweight and heavyweight champion,
   youngest fighter to win a UFC championship, most wins in UFC light
   heavyweight history (20), most wins in UFC title fights (15), tied for
   most successful title defenses in UFC history (11), longest unbeaten
   streak in UFC history (19), UFC Hall of Famer.

   There's a reason UFC president Dana White calls Jones the greatest
   mixed martial artist to ever live. In a sport where the margin between
   victory and defeat is razor thin, Jones has managed to go 16 years
   without being defeated by an opponent (his only "loss" came via
   controversial DQ to Matt Hamill in 2009).

   After becoming the youngest fighter to win a UFC championship in 2011,
   Jones went dominant on a litany of Hall of Fame caliber fighters for
   the next four years, with impressive wins over the likes of Daniel
   Cormier, Quinton "Rampage" Jackson, Lyoto Machida, Vitor Belfort and
   Rashad Evans. Not only did he beat them, but he did so by playing to
   his opponent's strengths and then running roughshod over them. The
   résumé is undeniable, and the accolades are still piling up. -- Andreas

67. James Harden, basketball

   Key accomplishments: NBA 75th Anniversary team, 2017-18 MVP, 10-time
   All-Star, seven-time All-NBA selection, three-time scoring leader,
   two-time assists leader, 2011-12 Sixth Man of the Year.

   Harden will go down as one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history,
   but The Beard and his step-back were nearly unstoppable from 2017 to
   2020. He started his scoring spree with an MVP season in 2017-18,
   averaging 30.4 points, 8.8 assists and 5.4 rebounds. And he was even
   better the following season, averaging 36.1 points in 2018-19 -- the
   eighth-highest average in NBA history. Only Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin
   Baylor and Michael Jordan have averaged more points in a single season.
   He then averaged 34.3 points in 2019-20 to win his third consecutive
   scoring title. His scoring overshadows his other elite skill as a
   passer. Harden is the only player in NBA history to win three scoring
   titles and two assist titles. -- Ohm Youngmisuk

68. Phil Mickelson, golf

   Key accomplishments: Six major victories, became oldest major champion
   all-time at 2021 PGA Championship (first to win major after turning
   50).

   While history continues to define Mickelson's legacy after he recruited
   golfers to the Saudi Arabian-funded LIV Golf League, there's no denying
   he was once among the most popular players in the world. The golfer
   known as Lefty broke an 0-for-46 drought in majors when he captured the
   2004 Masters. He mesmerized fans with his incredible short game and won
   them over with a shy grin and thumbs-up gestures. He became the sport's
   oldest major champion at age 50 when he won the 2021 PGA Championship
   -- and was a pariah in his sport less than a year later. -- Mark

69. Jason Kidd, basketball

   Key accomplishments: NBA 75th Anniversary Team, Basketball Hall of
   Famer, 2011 NBA champion, eight-time All-Star, eight-time All-Defense,
   five-time All-NBA selection, four-time assists leader.

   If not for Shaquille O'Neal and Tim Duncan and the Lakers and Spurs
   dynasties of the early 2000s, Kidd might've had another championship
   and an MVP on his illustrious résumé. During his first two seasons in
   New Jersey, Kidd was at the peak of a career that saw him finish as one
   of the game's most elite passers and versatile triple-double threats.
   Kidd made teammates better everywhere he went, which was never more
   evident than during his first season in New Jersey in 2001-02, when he
   turned the Nets around from 26 wins the season before to 52 wins,
   leading to the franchise's first Finals appearance.

   Kidd, though, finished second in MVP voting to Duncan before being
   swept in the Finals by O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. The following season,
   Kidd got the Nets back to the Finals only to lose in six games to
   Duncan and the Spurs. He would finally get a championship ring playing
   alongside Dirk Nowitzki in Dallas in 2011. -- Ohm Youngmisuk

70. Andrés Iniesta, soccer

   Key accomplishments: World Cup winner, two-time European Championship
   winner, four-time Champions League winner, nine-time LaLiga winner,
   Ballon d'Or runner-up.

   On July 11, 2010, Iniesta changed Spanish football forever. In the
   116th minute of the World Cup final in Johannesburg, South Africa --
   the game, tied at 0-0, had gone to extra time -- Iniesta collected a
   pass from Cesc Fabregas inside the penalty box, and coolly fired the
   bouncing ball low past Netherlands goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg. Cue
   euphoria. Spain won the game 1-0, lifted the World Cup for the first
   time, and Iniesta instantly became the most popular man in the country.
   An elegant, skillful playmaker, he was also a key member of one of the
   best club sides of the modern era, Pep Guardiola's Barcelona. -- Alex

71. Manny Pacquiao, boxing

   Key accomplishments: Since Jan. 1, 2000: 35-6-2 pro record,
   multidivision world champion, held world titles in 2000s, 2010s and
   2020s.

   Pacquiao was unknown when he first fought in the U.S in 2001, but he
   became a record eight-division world champion. His all-attack, buzz saw
   style, with punches thrown from all angles, overwhelmed ring greats
   such as Marco Antonio Barrera, Erik Morales, Oscar De La Hoya and
   Miguel Cotto.

   His fight against Floyd Mayweather took five years to finally happen,
   and while it didn't deliver the entertainment boxing fans were
   expecting, it generated more than $600 million in total revenue.
   Pacquiao also had a memorable feud with Juan Manuel Marquez, winning
   the first three fights and losing the fourth by KO. Pacquiao recovered
   from that defeat in 2012 to win six more welterweight title fights by
   2019. -- Nick Parkinson

72. Shaun White, snowboarding

   Key accomplishments: Three-time Olympic gold medalist in halfpipe
   (2006, 2010, 2018), 15-time X Games medalist.

   White stood at the top of the halfpipe at the 2018 Olympics and
   prepared to take his third and final run. He was in second place behind
   two-time silver medalist Ayumu Hirano, who had just landed back-to-back
   1440s. White knew he needed to land the combo to best Hirano, but four
   months earlier, he'd crashed attempting to learn a cab double cork 1440
   and suffered horrific injuries that required 62 stitches in his face
   and landed him in intensive care.

   White hadn't attempted the trick since, and he'd never landed
   back-to-back 14s. But in a move that embodied White's competitive
   nature and the spirit of action sports, he went for the combo, rode
   away clean and won his third Olympic gold in the event. "Before my last
   run, I was like, 'OK, I can live with second,'" White said that night.
   "But I realized at that moment, I didn't have to." -- Alyssa Roenigk

73. Mookie Betts, baseball

   Key accomplishments: 2018 MVP, two-time World Series winner (2018 with
   the Boston Red Sox, 2020 with the Los Angeles Dodgers), seven-time
   All-Star, six-time Gold Glove, six-time Silver Slugger, won batting
   title in 2018.

   It was a hot, sweltering day early in spring training. The Red Sox were
   coming off a 2018 World Series title and the training staff had players
   running a cone drill. Most took it slow and leisurely. One did not.
   Maybe that helps explain why Betts is perhaps the perfect ballplayer --
   a remarkable hitter for average and power, a right fielder who can
   execute the impossible throw (ask Tony Kemp), an athlete who can move
   to shortstop mid-career. A Harvard analysis from 2021 named Betts the
   best all-around player in MLB history: Yes, Betts is good at
   everything. -- David Schoenfield

   three-time Olympic gold medalist, three-time WNBA MVP, two-time WNBA
   Defensive Player of the Year, seven-time All-WNBA First Team,
   Basketball Hall of Famer.

   Leslie was a high school phenom in Inglewood, California, who played
   collegiately at USC and professionally for the Los Angeles Sparks. But
   she made a global impact on the game, winning four Olympic gold medals
   (three since 2000) and was the national team's mainstay in the post her
   entire USA Basketball career. Leslie led the Sparks to the 2001 and
   2002 WNBA titles and the 2003 Finals. Leslie, Sheryl Swoopes and Lauren
   Jackson are the WNBA's only three-time MVPs. She is the modern model
   for her position; fittingly, the Hall of Fame/WBCA honor for women's
   college centers was named the Lisa Leslie Award in 2018. -- Michael

75. Xavi Hernandez, soccer

   Key accomplishments: World Cup winner, two-time European Championship
   winner, two-time Champions League winner, eight-time LaLiga winner.

   Xavi had so many career highs that it's impossible to pick just one.
   You might choose Barcelona's famous 6-2 win at rivals Real Madrid, Xavi
   playing a part in four of the goals. Or his performance in the 2009
   Champions League final, supplying the pass for Lionel Messi's headed
   opening goal. You could pick Barcelona's dominant 3-1 win over
   Manchester United in 2011. For a game that summed up an era, you'd
   highlight Spain's 4-0 demolition of Italy at Euro 2012, the apotheosis
   of their tiki-taka short-passing style, which Xavi personified. But
   let's choose an entire season: Xavi's imperial 2008-09, when the
   midfielder -- arguably the game's best-ever passer -- registered a
   staggering 20 assists in 35 LaLiga matches. -- Alex Kirkland

76. Georges St-Pierre, MMA

   Key accomplishments: UFC Hall of Famer, UFC welterweight and
   middleweight champion, nine UFC welterweight title defenses.

   Arguably no fighter in UFC history bridged the gap better from the
   sport's "older days" to its modern form. Particularly from 2006 to
   2013, St-Pierre represented everything mixed martial arts was looking
   for. He was essentially perfect in those years, winning 14 of 15 bouts,
   including 12 title fights. At one point, he won 33 consecutive rounds.
   He was solely responsible for an explosion of fan interest in Canada
   and was one of the promotion's biggest stars globally. His style was
   ahead of its time, known for blending a variety of skills seamlessly
   together. He is also remembered as one of the most outspoken critics of
   performance-enhancing drugs during his era. -- Brett Okamoto

   Key accomplishments: Eight-time Olympic medalist, three-time Olympic
   gold medalist, record five 100-meter world titles, oldest sprinter (35
   in 2022) to win world title.

   One day after Usain Bolt's win in the 100 meters at the 2008 Beijing
   Olympics, Fraser-Pryce became the first woman from the Caribbean to win
   Olympic gold in the event. Four years later, she defended her title in
   the 100 (as did Bolt), further cementing Jamaica's reputation as a
   sprinting powerhouse. Only 5 feet tall and typically sporting rainbow
   locks, the "Pocket Rocket'' has medaled in track and field's fastest
   race in the past four Games. In Paris, her fifth and final Olympics,
   Fraser-Pryce will line up once more with the goal of reclaiming her
   title as the fastest woman alive. -- Alyssa Roenigk

   ever boxing world champion at age 49, 20 middleweight title defenses,
   two-division world champion

   Hopkins' otherworldly longevity saw him fittingly call himself "The
   Alien" late in a 28-year professional career. He made a record 20 world
   middleweight title defenses (1996-2005) and stopped Oscar De La Hoya
   with a body shot to become undisputed champion in 2004. The
   Philadelphia native's ring IQ and exceptional conditioning allowed him
   to win world titles well into his 40s. In 2011, Hopkins outpointed Jean
   Pascal for the light heavyweight title to become the oldest boxing
   world champion at 46 years old. Two years later, Hopkins won back a
   light heavyweight title, and in 2014, at age 49, he defeated light
   heavyweight champion Beibut Shumenov. -- Nick Parkinson

   MVP, 2018 HR Derby champion at Nationals Park

   He was on the cover of Sports Illustrated at 16 with the headline
   "Baseball's Chosen One" and has somehow managed to live up to the hype,
   including some of the best postseason numbers of all time. He even
   helped make baseball fun again -- from his all-out style of play to his

   Key accomplishments: Three-time Grand Slam singles champion, finished
   in top 10 for nine consecutive years (2008-16), two-time Olympic gold
   medalist in singles.

   Once a part of the sport's Big Four, Murray was essentially removed
   from the conversation as Federer, Nadal and Djokovic emerged in a
   league of their own. But even while his tally of three major
   championships pales in comparison to those of his top peers, there was
   perhaps no victory more memorable than Murray's first title at
   Wimbledon in 2013. A year after coming devastatingly close to winning
   his home Slam, a determined Murray held off Djokovic in three
   convincing sets to win his maiden major title. Never one to be able to
   hide his emotions, Murray openly sobbed on the court after the victory,
   proving just how much it meant to him. The BBC called the achievement
   "the Holy Grail" for British sport. -- D'Arcy Maine

   Swoopes, a key part of the Houston Comets' dynasty, won the last of her
   four WNBA titles in 2000 and was the league's MVP in 2000, 2002 and
   2005. Known for three-level scoring, she was also one of the best
   disrupters of passing lanes in women's hoops history, which helped lead
   to her being honored as the WNBA's best defensive player in 2000, 2002
   and 2003. Two of her three Olympic golds came in 2000 and 2004, and she
   played in the WNBA until age 40. -- Michael Voepel

   Key accomplishments: Seven-time Olympic medalist, three-time Olympic
   gold medalist, six-time individual all-around world champion.

   Over an eight-year period from 2009 to 2016, Uchimura dominated men's
   gymnastics, going undefeated in all-around competition, winning
   back-to-back Olympic titles and leading the Japanese team to gold at
   the Rio Games. He retired from the sport in 2022 with a reputation for
   pairing extreme difficulty with unmatched consistency and flawless
   execution and is widely considered to be the GOAT of men's gymnastics.

   In one of his most memorable all-around performances, Uchimura averaged
   higher than a 9.0 execution score on every apparatus to take the
   all-around title at the 2011 world championships in Tokyo, which were
   held seven months after an earthquake and tsunami devastated northeast

   MVP, 2005-06 Rookie of the Year, six-time steals leader, five-time
   assists leader.

   Paul has run thousands of pick-and-rolls to perfection and dished the
   ball out for nearly 12,000 assists, but his greatest accomplishment
   might have been transforming the LA Clippers from annual punching bags
   to perennial playoff contenders while orchestrating the unforgettable
   Lob City teams. Before Paul's arrival in Los Angeles, the franchise had
   made the postseason just seven times in its history.

   Paul's Clippers made the playoffs six consecutive times as he delivered
   some of the most scintillating alley-oops in NBA history to Blake
   Griffin and DeAndre Jordan. Clippers fans won't forget Paul's Game

   three-time Olympic silver and one-time bronze medalist, three-time WNBA
   MVP, 2007 WNBA Defensive Player of the Year, seven-time All-WNBA first
   team, two-time WNBA All-Defensive first team, Basketball Hall of Famer.

   Jackson is the best women's basketball player from Australia, and one
   of the best from anywhere. Drafted No. 1 by the Seattle Storm at age 19
   in 2001, she is one of three players to be a three-time WNBA MVP. She
   led the Storm to the 2004 and 2010 league titles, and her 2007 and 2006
   seasons are the top two in player efficiency rating in WNBA history.
   Jackson was known for her powerful inside presence offensively and
   defensively. Her WNBA career ended after the 2012 season because of
   injury issues, but she later resumed her career in Australia and has
   made her fifth Olympic team this year at age 43. -- Michael Voepel

85. Kawhi Leonard, basketball

   Key accomplishments: Two-time Finals MVP, two-time NBA champion,
   six-time All-Star, five-time All-NBA selection, two-time Defensive
   Player of the Year.

   Not even an LA Clippers tenure marred by injuries can diminish a legacy
   that only a handful of players in history can match or top. Leonard is
   one of 12 players to ever win two NBA Finals MVP trophies. None of
   them, however, led a Canadian team to the country's first NBA
   championship. In leading Toronto to the title in 2019, Leonard cemented
   himself as one of the game's most clutch players when healthy in the
   playoffs. He delivered one of the most legendary buzzer-beaters in
   playoff history when his twisting corner jumper softly bounced on the
   rim four times and in to eliminate Philadelphia in Game 7 of the
   Eastern Conference semifinals that season.

   Even during his five-year Clippers tenure, Leonard has shown signs of
   dominance when healthy. He just has to finish a postseason healthy
   again, something he hasn't done since the 2020 bubble. -- Ohm

86. Venus Williams, tennis

   Key accomplishments: Seven-time major singles champ, five-time
   Wimbledon champ, 270 major match wins (fifth most by a woman in the
   Open era), a record 89 career major appearances in singles.

   The elder Williams sister burst onto the tennis scene as an
   enthusiastic and joyful teenager, and likely would have won many more
   titles if not for the arrival of Serena. While Williams' results have
   been remarkable, and she has the most major titles among active women
   on tour, she has been equally influential off the court as a champion
   for gender equality in tennis and beyond.

   While advocating for equal pay at Wimbledon, Williams asked tournament
   officials at a meeting a simple question: "Would you want your daughter
   or your sister or your mother or your wife or a loved one to be a woman
   paid less?'" Wimbledon started offering equal prize money for men and
   women in 2007. Williams called the achievement "the best moment of my
   career" in 2023. -- D'Arcy Maine
     * Venus Williams is out of 2023 Wimbledon, but her status remains
       legendary

87. Ronaldo Nazário, soccer

   Key accomplishments: Two-time FIFA World Cup winner, two-time Ballon
   d'Or winner, two-time Copa América winner, three-time FIFA World Player
   of the Year, Golden Ball winner 1998 men's World Cup, Golden Boot
   winner 2002 men's World Cup.

   The original Ronaldo was probably the fastest, most powerful striker
   running with the ball in the history of the game, capable of variations
   at pace and able to slow down, keep his head still and shoot at goal
   with cool precision. All of these virtues were best seen in the 20th
   century -- but the 21st came up with the best storyline. Twice his knee
   collapsed beneath him and he was left howling in gruesome pain. Many
   thought the second time was the end of his career.

   In the buildup to the 2002 World Cup, Inter Milan, his Italian club,
   could not get him fit. Brazil took charge, and he took the tournament
   by storm, carrying a side that nearly failed to qualify all the way to
   a memorable triumph. It is one of the great comeback stories in the
   history of sport. -- Tim Vickery

88. Roy Halladay, baseball

   Key accomplishments: Since Jan. 1, 2000: Hall of Famer, two-time Cy
   Young winner (one of seven players to win Cy Young in both American and
   National leagues), eight-time All-Star, two no-hitters.

   Halladay was the product of a bygone era in which a pitcher endeavored
   to finish what he started. Never gifted with overwhelming velocity,
   Halladay killed with paper cuts. He walked hitters at an almost
   identical rate to Greg Maddux and logged 220-plus-inning seasons like
   they were nothing. His right arm got the glory, but it was Halladay's
   brain -- his innate sense of how to pitch to every hitter -- that won
   him 203 games. When he died in a plane crash in 2017, a profound
   sadness spread through the sport. The great pitching artisan was gone,
   never to be replicated. -- Jeff Passan

89. Annika Sorenstam, golf

   Key accomplishments: Since Jan. 1, 2000: Eight major wins (most during
   span); earned 54 of her 72 career LPGA Tour victories, competed in PGA
   Tour event in 2003.

   It's not only that the Swedish-born golfer won 97 times around the
   world, captured 10 major championships and is the only woman to card a
   59 in a professional tournament. Or that Sorenstam won 11 times in 2002
   -- the most on the LPGA Tour in nearly 40 years -- and became the first
   woman to play in a PGA event in more than a half-century when she
   competed in the Bank of America Colonial Tournament in 2003. It's that
   when Sorenstam retired from full-time competitive play at age 38 in
   2008, she still had some of her best golf in front of her. During her
   Hall of Fame career, Sorenstam set scoring records for 72- and 54-hole
   tournaments. -- Mark Schlabach

90. A'ja Wilson, basketball

   Key accomplishments: Two-time WNBA champion, 2023 Finals MVP, 2020
   Olympic gold medalist, two-time WNBA MVP, two-time WNBA Defensive
   Player of the Year, 2018 WNBA Rookie of the Year, three-time All-WNBA
   first team, two-time WNBA All-Defensive first team, 2017 NCAA champion
   and Final Four Most Outstanding Player, 2018 Wade Trophy winner.

   Wilson helped lead her hometown South Carolina Gamecocks to their first
   Final Four in 2015 and first NCAA title in 2017. The No. 1 pick in
   2018, she was drafted by the newly relocated Las Vegas Aces and has
   been a perfect fit there. She recently became the franchise's leading
   career scorer and will participate in her second Olympics. She is
   favored to win a third WNBA MVP award and is on track to have the best
   player efficiency rating in league history. She turns 28 in August but
   already has a statue outside her college arena. -- Michael Voepel

91. Aaron Rodgers, football

   Key accomplishments: Four-time NFL MVP, 10-time Pro Bowler, four-time
   first-team All-Pro, HOF All-2010s team, Super Bowl XLV MVP, 475 pass
   TDs (Packers' career leader).

   Of all the superlatives and milestones that can be used to explain
   Rodgers' greatness, here's one that often gets overlooked. He's the
   NFL's career leader in touchdown-to-interception ratio (475 TDs, 105
   INTS). In that way, he was the anti-Brett Favre, yet he carried on
   Favre's remarkable run of success in Green Bay before getting traded to
   the Jets. Packers coach Matt LaFleur perhaps described Rodgers' impact
   best when he said near the end of Rodgers' run with the Packers: "A lot
   of people have been rewarded, quite frankly, because of his ability to
   go out there and play." -- Rob Demovsky
     * Aaron Rodgers' timeline with Packers, ending in trade to Jets

   [greyline.png] [240715_top-100_inlines_092.jpg]

92. Pedro Martinez, baseball

   Key accomplishments: Since Jan. 1, 2000: Hall of Famer, 2000 Cy Young
   Winner, four-time All-Star, three-time ERA title, 2004 World Series
   winner, 2000 and 2002 strikeout leader.

   Before Martinez and his 2004 Boston teammates ended the franchise's
   epic World Series title drought, every Red Sox star had to field
   endless questions about the "Curse of the Bambino." One of Martinez's
   answers summed up how a short, skinny righty could become one of the
   most dominant hurlers ever: "I don't believe in damn curses. Wake up
   the damn Bambino and have me face him. Maybe I'll drill him in the
   a--." From 1997 to 2003, the height of one of baseball's most explosive
   offensive eras, Martinez was as good as any pitcher has ever been,
   going 118-36 with a 2.20 ERA, 213 ERA+ and over 250 strikeouts per
   season and winning three Cy Young Awards. -- Bradford Doolittle

   [greyline.png] [240715_top-100_inlines_093.jpg]

93. Rory McIlroy, golf

   Key accomplishments: 122 weeks spent as world No. 1 golfer, 26 PGA Tour
   victories (including four major wins), a Masters victory shy of
   completing career Grand Slam.

   After McIlroy won his first two major championships, the 2011 U.S. Open
   and 2012 PGA Championship, by eight strokes and then added two more
   majors in a three-week span in 2014, The Guardian of London declared
   that it was "the dawning of a new era." There's no question McIlroy has
   been one of the most consistent and popular golfers of his generation.
   He has won 40 times, including 26 times on the PGA Tour. He is a
   three-time PGA Tour Player of the Year and a five-time winner of the DP
   World Tour's Race to Dubai. However, McIlroy's nearly 10-year drought
   in the four majors since capturing the 2014 PGA Championship leaves him
   a step below legends such as Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer
   and others. Unless, of course, McIlroy still has a few more victories
   coming. -- Mark Schlabach

94. Ronaldinho, soccer

   Key accomplishments: FIFA World Cup winner, Ballon d'Or winner, Copa
   América winner, two-time FIFA World Player of the Year, two-time LaLiga
   winner.

   If longevity were not a factor in defining the greatest of all time,
   then Ronaldinho would certainly be a candidate for his feats in his
   first three years with Barcelona. Between 2003 and 2006, there was no
   better show in soccer. There have been few, if any, more talented
   players in the history of the global game, and all too briefly
   Ronaldinho captivated with his childlike glee at his own achievements,
   reminding so many of why they fell in love with the sport in the first
   place. A disappointing 2006 World Cup was a turning point, and he
   appeared to grow weary of the sacrifices needed to stay at the top
   level. But those three years were unforgettable. -- Tim Vickery
     * Ronaldinho's 'what ifs' are irrelevant, just celebrate one of the
       greatest ever

   [greyline.png] [240715_top-100_inlines_095.jpg]

95. Zlatan Ibrahimović, soccer

   Key accomplishments: 511 career goals, scored at least one Champions
   League goal with six teams, 12 league titles with five European clubs,
   named to UEFA's team of the year four times, Sweden's leading career
   scorer, represented Sweden at six major tournaments.

   "I can't help but laugh at how perfect I am." There has never existed
   an athlete who was as good as Zlatan Ibrahimović said he was, but the
   6-foot-5 striker did as well as anyone could -- and for as long as
   anyone could -- at approaching that level. He was the purest scorer
   this side of Cristiano Ronaldo; he put the ball in the net at least
   once in four different decades, and he kept improving into his 30s. He
   scored at least 30 goals in all competitions six times between 2011 and
   2019, peaking with an incredible 50-goal campaign with PSG in 2015-16.
   He was the personification of artistry and brute force at the same
   time. -- Bill Connelly

96. Darrelle Revis, football

   Key accomplishments: Hall of Famer (2023), seven-time Pro Bowler,
   four-time first-team All-Pro, HOF All-2010s team.

   Revis took man-to-man coverage to a new level in 2009 when the Jets'
   coaching staff made the unconventional decision to put him on the
   opponents' top receiver with no safety help. He was on his own island,
   so to speak, spawning the "Revis Island" moniker. The result was one of
   the best cornerback seasons in history. Revis held Andre Johnson, Randy
   Moss (twice) and Terrell Owens (twice) -- all Hall of Famers -- under
   35 receiving yards. He did the same to Torry Holt, Steve Smith Sr.,
   Reggie Wayne and Chad "Ochocinco" Johnson. He finished with six
   interceptions and a staggering 31 passes defended, earning the first of
   four first-team All-Pro selections. -- Rich Cimini
     * 'Revis Island' resonates long after Hall of Famer's retirement

   [greyline.png]

   [240715_top-100_inlines_097.jpg]

97. Virat Kohli, cricket

   Key accomplishments: ODI World Cup champion, T20 World Cup champion,
   two-time T20 World Cup Player of the Tournament, 2023 ODI World Cup
   Player of the Tournament, two-time ICC Cricketer of the Year, most
   centuries in ODI history (50), second-highest scorer in T20Is,
   third-highest scorer in ODIs, India's most successful Test captain.

   Kohli won the World Cup early in his career, but he was at risk of
   fading away into mediocrity in the early 2010s. A fierce fitness-driven
   approach -- the kind that was uncommon in cricket then -- coupled with
   unrelenting drive catapulted him from "talent" to titan. The fire
   within translates onto the field. The Indian batter is the ultimate
   competitor and has won games on willpower alone. The intensity of his
   passion sparks fear in the opposition and bedlam in the stands. Kohli
   wasn't born to be the best; he just willed himself to be. -- Shubi Arun

98. Connor McDavid, hockey

   Key accomplishments: Five-time Art Ross Trophy winner, three-time Hart
   Trophy winner, seven 100-point seasons in first nine NHL seasons, 2024
   Conn Smythe winner.

   It could be daunting to be touted as The Next One behind Edmonton
   Oilers legend Wayne Gretzky. McDavid isn't like the rest, though.
   Edmonton's captain has embraced that spotlight as Gretzky's heir
   apparent. It was fitting when McDavid broke a record Gretzky set in
   1987-88 with his 32nd assist of the 2024 postseason during Edmonton's
   run to a Stanley Cup Final. McDavid had long been an exceptional
   playmaker in his own right, but the way he carried the Oilers back from
   a 3-0 series deficit in the Final to force a decisive Game 7 was
   spectacular. And it rightly earned McDavid a Conn Smythe Trophy in the
   losing effort. -- Kristen Shilton

99. Ed Reed, football

   Key accomplishments: Hall of Famer (2019), nine-time Pro Bowler,
   five-time first-team All-Pro, HOF All-2000s team, 2004 Defensive Player
   of the Year.

   Reed was the ultimate defensive game changer of his generation. In
   2004, he set an NFL record by returning an interception 106 yards for a
   touchdown against the Browns. Four years later, he broke his own record
   with a 107-yarder against the Eagles. Reed is the only player in NFL
   history to score touchdowns off a punt return, blocked punt,
   interception and fumble recovery.

   "You see the safety's out in the middle of the field and have a
   wide-open throw on the right. The next thing you know he's intercepting
   it," former Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger said. "Where did he
   come from? It's impossible. That's what made it such a challenge. He
   made the impossible possible." -- Jamison Hensley

   Key accomplishments: Hall of Famer (2021), nine-time Pro Bowler,
   three-time first-team All-Pro, HOF All-2000s team, 2009 Defensive
   Player of the Year.

   Woodson's career was a three-act play. In Oakland, as a Heisman
   Trophy-winning No. 4 pick, he was a hard-partying, hard-playing Hall of
   Fame talent. In Green Bay, he became a Hall of Famer. And with his
   return to the Raiders, he became a legend, making the switch from wild
   youngster at cornerback to sage vet at free safety. And if he lost a
   step, it was one precious few others ever had. "It was a beautiful
   transition," Woodson said, "if you will." And his first NFL coach, Jon
   Gruden, most certainly would. The slower-paced lifestyle of Green Bay
   helped Woodson, well, slow down and center himself. "And he met and
   married the right woman and had kids," Gruden said. -- Paul Gutierrez

Methodology

   Experts in individual sports were asked to vote to rank the top
   athletes in their sport since Jan. 1, 2000 (no accomplishments before
   this date were to be considered). Those votes pared down pools in each
   sport to lists of 10 to 25 athletes each, which constituted the overall
   candidate pool for the top athletes of the 21st century so far. Each
   voter was presented two randomly selected names and asked to pick which
   one has had the better career in the 21st century. Across repeated,
   randomized head-to-head matchups, more than 70,000 votes were cast at
   this stage, and using an Elo rating system, the list was pared down
   from 262 to 100. That list was then evaluated by a panel of experts for
   any inconsistencies or oversights, resulting in the top 100 ranking
   seen here.
