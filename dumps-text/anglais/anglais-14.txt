birth of a legend

   When the Romans first came to northern Scotland in the first century
   A.D., they found the Highlands occupied by fierce, tattoo-covered
   tribes they called the Picts, or painted people. From the carved,
   standing stones still found in the region around Loch Ness, it is clear
   the Picts were fascinated by animals, and careful to render them with
   great fidelity. All the animals depicted on the Pictish stones are
   lifelike and easily recognizable—all but one. The exception is a
   strange beast with an elongated beak or muzzle, a head locket or spout,
   and flippers instead of feet. Described by some scholars as a swimming
   elephant, the Pictish beast is the earliest known evidence for an idea
   that has held sway in the Scottish Highlands for at least 1,500
   years—that Loch Ness is home to a mysterious aquatic animal.

   In Scottish folklore, large animals have been associated with many
   bodies of water, from small streams to the largest lakes, often labeled
   Loch-na-Beistie on old maps. These water-horses, or water-kelpies, are
   said to have magical powers and malevolent intentions. According to one
   version of the legend, the water-horse lures small children into the
   water by offering them rides on its back. Once the children are aboard,
   their hands become stuck to the beast and they are dragged to a watery
   death, their livers washing ashore the following day.

   The earliest written reference linking such creatures to Loch Ness is
   in the biography of Saint Columba, the man credited with introducing
   Christianity to Scotland. In A.D. 565, according to this account,
   Columba was on his way to visit a Pictish king when he stopped along
   the shore of Loch Ness. Seeing a large beast about to attack a man who
   was swimming in the lake, Columba raised his hand, invoking the name of
   God and commanding the monster to "go back with all speed." The beast
   complied, and the swimmer was saved.

   Daily Mail newspaper headline of Loch Ness The Loch Ness Monster has
   been headline news all over the world for more than 60 years.
   Daily Mail

   When Nicholas Witchell, a future BBC correspondent, researched the
   history of the legend for his 1974 book The Loch Ness Story, he found
   about a dozen pre-20th-century references to large animals in Loch
   Ness, gradually shifting in character from these clearly mythical
   accounts to something more like eyewitness descriptions.

a 20th-century sensation

   The modern legend of Loch Ness dates from 1933, when a new road was
   completed along the shore, offering the first clear views of the loch
   from the northern side. One April afternoon, a local couple was driving
   home along this road when they spotted "an enormous animal rolling and
   plunging on the surface." Their account was written up by a
   correspondent for the Inverness Courier, whose editor used the word
   "monster" to describe the animal. The Loch Ness Monster has been a
   media phenomenon ever since.

   Public interest built gradually during the spring of 1933, then picked
   up sharply after a couple reported seeing one of the creatures on land,
   lumbering across the shore road. By October, several London newspapers
   had sent correspondents to Scotland, and radio programs were being
   interrupted to bring listeners the latest news from the loch. A British
   circus offered a reward of £20,000 for the capture of the beast.
   Hundreds of boy scouts and outdoorsmen arrived, some venturing out in
   small boats, others setting up deck chairs and waiting expectantly for
   the monster to appear.

   The excitement over the monster reached a fever pitch in December, when
   the London Daily Mail hired an actor, film director, and big-game
   hunter named Marmaduke Wetherell to track down the beast. After only a
   few days at the loch, Wetherell reported finding the fresh footprints
   of a large, four-toed animal. He estimated it to be 20 feet long. With
   great fanfare, Wetherell made plaster casts of the footprints and, just
   before Christmas, sent them off to the Natural History Museum in London
   for analysis. While the world waited for the museum zoologists to
   return from holiday, legions of monster hunters descended on Loch Ness,
   filling the local hotels. Inverness was floodlit for the occasion, and
   traffic jammed the shoreline roads in both directions.

   The bubble burst in early January, when museum zoologists announced
   that the footprints were those of a hippopotamus. They had been made
   with a stuffed hippo foot—the base of an umbrella stand or ashtray. It
   wasn't clear whether Wetherell was the perpetrator of the hoax or its
   gullible victim. Either way, the incident tainted the image of the Loch
   Ness Monster and discouraged serious investigation of the phenomenon.
   For the next three decades, most scientists scornfully dismissed
   reports of strange animals in the loch. Those sightings that weren't
   outright hoaxes, they said, were the result of optical illusions caused
   by boat wakes, wind slicks, floating logs, otters, ducks, or swimming
   deer.

Saw Something, They Did

   Nevertheless, eyewitnesses continued to come forward with accounts of
   their sightings—more than 4,000 of them, according to Witchell's
   estimate. Most of the witnesses described a large creature with one or
   more humps protruding above the surface like the hull of an upturned
   boat. Others reported seeing a long neck or flippers. What was most
   remarkable, however, was that many of the eyewitnesses were sober,
   level-headed people: lawyers and priests, scientists and school
   teachers, policemen and fishermen—even a Nobel Prize winner.

   In the 1950s, a local doctor named Constance Whyte began collecting
   these eyewitness accounts, along with sketches of what the people had
   seen, finally publishing them in 1957 as a book entitled More Than a
   Legend. Noting that many of her friends had been subjected to ridicule
   and contempt, Whyte said her goal in writing the book was "the
   vindication of many people of integrity who had reported honestly what
   they had seen in Loch Ness." (To hear recent personal anecdotes, see
   Eyewitness Accounts.)

   Whyte's book inspired a new generation of monster hunters, including
   Tim Dinsdale, who on his first visit to the loch in 1960 took an
   intriguing film of something moving across the loch—and promptly gave
   up his career as an aeronautical engineer to devote his life to
   pursuing the monster. The next year, a group of dedicated amateurs
   formed the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau, keeping a constant vigil on
   the loch from an observation post on the northern shore.

   But perhaps the most important effect of Whyte's book was to turn the
   tide of public opinion. Long dismissed as fodder for "silly season"
   press reports, Nessie was finally considered a subject worthy of
   serious scientific investigation. In the span of a decade, beginning in
   1958, four separate expeditions were launched, first by the BBC, then
   by three respected British universities: Oxford, Cambridge, and the
   University of Birmingham. Rather than scanning the surface with
   binoculars and cameras, as the amateur investigators had, these
   expeditions came equipped with sonar, a military technology that used
   sound to search the underwater environment. Though the expeditions
   found nothing conclusive, in each case the sonar operators detected
   large, moving underwater objects they could not explain. (To learn how
   sonar works, see Experiment with Sonar.)

   In 1987, Operation Deep Scan, the most ambitious sonar survey of Loch
   Ness, found three unexplained underwater targets.

high-tech searches

   The use of technology to search the loch reached a new level in the
   1970s, when a series of expeditions was sponsored by the Boston-based
   Academy of Applied Science, whose members included many technically
   skilled people with ties to MIT. The Academy's approach was to set a
   trap for the monster by combining sonar and underwater photography for
   the first time. Under the leadership of Robert Rines, a lawyer trained
   in physics, the team pointed a sophisticated form of sonar, called side
   scan sonar, out into Loch Ness from a point near the shore. Nearby they
   placed an underwater camera taking pictures every 45 seconds as a
   strobe light illuminated the depths with a bright flash. The system
   paid off one night in 1975. At the same moment the sonar was
   registering a large, moving object, the underwater camera was taking
   pictures of an object that looked, after development and computer
   enhancement, like the flippers of an aquatic creature.

   Rines' discovery won the support of two reputable scientists: Harold
   "Doc" Edgerton, the legendary MIT scientist who had invented side scan
   sonar and strobe photography; and Sir Peter Scott, one of Britain's
   most respected naturalists. With Edgerton and Scott behind him, Rines
   was given an opportunity to present his evidence at a hearing at the
   House of Commons in London. Never had the possibility of the Loch Ness
   Monster been taken so seriously.

   Almost immediately, however, critics began to raise questions about the
   evidence. Could the suggestive sonar traces be the result of human
   error? Had the flipper photos been altered to improve their appearance?
   Just as damaging to Rines' case was Peter Scott's bold pronouncement
   about the identity of the creature. Based on the flipper photos and the
   eyewitness sightings, Scott concluded that Nessie was a plesiosaur, an
   ancient reptile that was thought to have gone extinct along with the
   dinosaurs some 65 million years ago. The idea was just too far-fetched
   for professional zoologists to take seriously.

   British naturalist, helped create the popular image of Nessie as an

   Although zoologists have yet to conduct the full-scale investigation
   Rines hoped to trigger, the loch continues to yield intriguing sonar
   hits. In 1987, an expedition called Operation Deep Scan used a flotilla
   of 20 sonar-equipped boats to sweep the loch with a curtain of sound;
   the operation yielded three underwater targets that could not be
   explained. In the early 1990s, the BBC's Nicholas Witchell helped
   organize Project Urquhart, the first extensive study of the loch's
   biology and geology. Although they weren't looking for monsters, the
   expedition's sonar operators detected a large, moving underwater target
   and followed it for several minutes before losing it. And during the
   1997 expedition featured in NOVA's Loch Ness film, Rines and his
   longtime colleague Charles Wyckoff detected yet another puzzling
   underwater target. According to the expedition's sonar expert, marine
   biologist Arne Carr, it was a moving target, appeared to be biological
   in nature, and was about 15 feet long—the size of a small whale.

Famous Photo Falsified?

   In the 65 years since the birth of the modern legend, dozens of people
   have come forward with photographs purporting to show the monster. Most
   were quickly dismissed as either outright frauds or images of ordinary
   objects mistaken for monsters. But one photo stood above the rest.
   Taken in 1934, it shows what appears to be the slender neck of an
   animal rising from the surface of the water. From the moment it was
   published in the London Daily Mail, it became the very image of the
   Loch Ness Monster and, for many, the strongest evidence that Nessie
   actually exists.

   The "surgeon's photo," published in 1934, became the very image of the
   Loch Ness Monster.

   One reason the photograph had such an impact on the Loch Ness legend
   was that it came from such a credible source. The photo was sold to the
   Daily Mail by a London physician named R. Kenneth Wilson, who said he
   had taken the picture when he noticed a commotion in the water as he
   was driving up from London to photograph birds with a friend near
   Inverness. Few believed that such a respected doctor could be party to
   a deception.

   source—a respected London doctor named R. Kenneth Wilson.

   But in 1994, 60 years after the photo was first published, newspapers
   around the world reported the claim that the "surgeon's photo" was a
   fake, part of an elaborate plot to dupe the Daily Mail. The man behind
   the story was a former English art teacher named Alastair Boyd, who had
   become an avid student of Loch Ness lore after he and his wife had had
   their own sighting of a large animal in the loch in 1979. Years later,
   a friend of Boyd's named David Martin discovered an old newspaper
   clipping in which Ian Wetherell (the son of Marmaduke Wetherell of
   hippo foot fame) claimed the surgeon's photo was a hoax. The article
   had attracted little attention when it was published in 1975, but two
   details caught Boyd's eye.

   First, Wetherell said the plot had involved a man named Maurice
   Chambers—the very same man that Dr. Wilson said he had driven up from
   London to visit in 1934. Second, Wetherell mentioned that the surgeon's
   photograph included the scenery of Loch Ness in the background. In
   fact, the familiar Nessie photo includes only the protruding neck and
   the water around it. Boyd knew that the original photo had included a
   bit of the far shoreline in the background, because he had rediscovered
   the uncropped version in the late '80s. But that full photo had been
   published only once, in 1934. So how could Wetherell have known this
   detail? "Either he had a very long memory, or he took the picture,"
   Boyd says.

   surgeon's photo uncropped The full, uncropped surgeon's photo,
   published only once in 1934, was rediscovered by Boyd more than 50
   years later.

   Ian Wetherell had died by the time Boyd and Martin read the article,
   but they were able to track down his step-brother, Christian Spurling,
   in the south of England. Spurling, 93 and near death, confessed.
   Unhappy with the way he was treated by the Daily Mail after the hippo
   foot fiasco, Duke Wetherell had set out to get his revenge, enlisting
   his son and step-son in the plot. First Spurling built a model monster
   by grafting a head and neck onto the conning tower of a toy submarine.
   Then Wetherell and his son Ian drove up to the loch and staged the
   photograph, taking care to include the actual Loch Ness scenery in the
   background. Finally, to conceal his own role in the hoax, Wetherell
   persuaded Dr. Wilson, through their common friend Chambers, to have the
   photo developed and sell it to the Daily Mail as his own. The plot
   worked better than any of them could have imagined.

   Not everyone accepts the Spurling story. American journalist Richard
   Smith, for example, notes that toy experts question whether the toy
   submarines of the 1930s could have performed as described, and he
   wonders why Boyd waited until after Spurling's death to reveal his
   confession. But in the aftermath of Boyd's 1994 bombshell, most people
   now believe the surgeon's photo was yet another Loch Ness hoax.

   The 93-year-old stepson of Marmaduke Wetherell told Boyd he made the
   monster in the picture by grafting a plastic wood neck to a toy
   submarine.

   Does that finally disprove the monster's existence? Not at all, says
   Boyd. One of the great ironies of the Loch Ness story is that the man
   who brought down the most famous piece of evidence remains a firm
   believer in Nessie. "I am so convinced of the reality of these
   creatures that I would actually stake my life on their existence," he
   told NOVA. "I trust my eyesight ... I used to make my living teaching
   people how to observe, and I know that the thing I saw was not a log or
   an otter or a wave, or anything like that. It was a large animal. It
   came heaving out of the water, something like a whale. I mean, the part
   that was actually on the surface when it stopped rolling through was at
   least 20 feet long. It was totally extraordinary. It's the most amazing
   thing I've ever seen in my life, and if I could afford to spend the
   rest of my life looking for another glimpse of it, I would."
