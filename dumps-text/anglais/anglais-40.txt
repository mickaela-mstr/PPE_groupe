   Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an
   American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the
   "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural
   figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his world
   record music achievements and publicized personal life made him a
   global figure. Through songs, stages, and fashion, he proliferated
   visual performance for singers in pop music, and popularized street
   dance moves including the moonwalk (which he named), the robot, and the
   anti-gravity lean.

   As part of the Jackson family, Michael at age six made his public debut
   in 1964 with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon, as a
   member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). The Jackson 5
   signed with Motown in 1968 and achieved worldwide success with Michael
   as lead singer. Jackson became a global solo star with the release of
   Off the Wall (1979). His groundbreaking music videos from his 1982
   album Thriller are credited with breaking racial barriers and
   transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool, as well
   as aiding the popularization of MTV. Jackson cemented his position as a
   global superstar with Bad (1987), the first album to produce five US
   Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles. Dangerous (1991), one of the most
   successful albums of the 1990s, saw Jackson venture into a multitude of
   sounds and experimentation.^[nb 1]

   From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and
   speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior,
   and lifestyle. He was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family
   friend in 1993. In 2005, Jackson was tried and acquitted of further
   child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. In 2009,
   while was preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, he
   died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal
   physician Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary
   manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered reactions around the world,
   creating unprecedented surges of internet traffic and a spike in sales
   of his music. His televised memorial service, held at the Staples
   Center in Los Angeles, was estimated to have been viewed by more than
   2.5 billion people.

   Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with
   estimated sales of over 500 million records worldwide.^[nb 2] He had 13
   Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles (the chart's fourth-highest of any
   artist) and was the first artist to have a top-ten single on the
   Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. Jackson's inductions
   include the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice), the National Rhythm &
   Blues Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall
   of Fame and the Dance Hall of Fame (making him the only recording
   artist to be inducted). His honors include 13 Grammy Awards, as well as
   the Grammy Legend.

   Jackson's childhood home in Gary, Indiana, pictured in March 2010

   Michael Joseph Jackson^[3]^[4] was born in Gary, Indiana, on August 29,
   1958.^[5]^[6] He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family,
   a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house
   on Jackson Street.^[7]^[8] His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née
   Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a
   country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears.^[9] She
   was a Jehovah's Witness.^[10] His father, Joseph Walter "Joe" Jackson,
   a former boxer, was a crane operator at US Steel and played guitar with
   a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's
   income.^[11]^[12] Joe's great-grandfather, July "Jack" Gale, was a US
   Army scout; family lore held that he was also a Native American
   medicine man.^[13] Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya,
   and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and
   Randy).^[11] A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after
   birth.^[14]

   In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed
   by their father which included Jackie, Tito and Jermaine—as backup
   musicians playing congas and tambourine.^[15]^[16] Michael said his
   father told him he had a "fat nose",^[17] and physically and
   emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often
   sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings
   rehearsed, ready to punish any mistakes.^[10]^[18] Joe acknowledged
   that he regularly whipped Michael.^[19] Katherine said that although
   whipping came to be considered abuse, it was a common way to discipline
   children when Michael was growing up.^[20]^[21] Jackie, Tito, Jermaine
   and Marlon denied that their father was abusive and said that the
   whippings, which had a deeper impact on Michael because he was younger,
   kept them disciplined and out of trouble.^[22] Michael said that during
   his youth he was lonely and isolated.^[23]

   Later in 1965, Michael began sharing lead vocals with Jermaine, and the
   group's name was changed to the Jackson 5.^[24] In 1965, the group won
   a talent show; Michael performed the dance to Robert Parker's 1965 song
   "Barefootin'" and sang the Temptations' "My Girl".^[25] From 1966 to
   1968, the Jacksons 5 toured the Midwest; they frequently played at a
   string of black clubs known as the Chitlin' Circuit as the opening act
   for artists such as Sam & Dave, the O'Jays, Gladys Knight and Etta
   James. The Jackson 5 also performed at clubs and cocktail lounges,
   where striptease shows were featured, and at local auditoriums and high
   school dances.^[26]^[27] In August 1967, while touring the East Coast,
   they won a weekly amateur night concert at the Apollo Theater in
   Harlem.^[28]
   [220px-Jackson_5_tv_special_1972.JPG] Michael Jackson (center) as a
   member of the Jackson 5 in 1972. The group were among the first African
   American performers to attain a crossover following.^[29]

   The Jackson 5 recorded several songs for a Gary record label, Steeltown
   Records; their first single, "Big Boy", was released in 1968.^[30]
   Bobby Taylor of Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers brought the Jackson 5 to
   Motown after they opened for Taylor at Chicago's Regal Theater in 1968.
   Taylor produced some of their early Motown recordings, including a
   version of "Who's Lovin' You".^[31] After signing with Motown, the
   Jackson family relocated to Los Angeles.^[32] In 1969, Motown
   executives decided Diana Ross should introduce the Jackson 5 to the
   public — partly to bolster her career in television — sending off what
   was considered Motown's last product of its "production line".^[33] The
   Jackson 5 made their first television appearance in 1969 in the Miss
   Black America pageant, performing a cover of "It's Your Thing".^[34]
   Rolling Stone later described the young Michael as "a prodigy" with
   "overwhelming musical gifts" who "quickly emerged as the main draw and
   lead singer".^[35]

   In January 1970, "I Want You Back" became the first Jackson 5 song to
   reach number one on the US Billboard Hot 100; it stayed there for four
   weeks. Three more singles with Motown topped the chart: "ABC", "The
   Love You Save", and "I'll Be There".^[36] In May 1971, the Jackson
   family moved into a large house at Hayvenhurst, a 2-acre (0.81 ha)
   estate in Encino, California.^[37] During this period, Michael
   developed from a child performer into a teen idol.^[38] Between 1972
   and 1975, he released four solo studio albums with Motown: Got to Be
   There (1972), Ben (1972), Music & Me (1973) and Forever, Michael
   (1975).^[39] "Got to Be There" and "Ben", the title tracks from his
   first two solo albums, sold well as singles, as did a cover of Bobby
   Day's "Rockin' Robin".^[40]

   Michael maintained ties to the Jackson 5.^[39] The Jackson 5 were later
   described as "a cutting-edge example of black crossover artists".^[41]
   They were frustrated by Motown's refusal to allow them creative
   input.^[42] Jackson's performance of their top five single "Dancing
   Machine" on Soul Train popularized the robot dance.^[43]^[44]

   row: Randy, La Toya, Rebbie. Front row: Janet

   The Jackson 5 left Motown in 1975, signing with Epic Records and
   renaming themselves the Jacksons.^[45] Their younger brother Randy
   joined the band around this time; Jermaine stayed with Motown and
   pursued a solo career.^[46] The Jacksons continued to tour
   internationally, and released six more albums between 1976 and 1984.
   Michael, the group's main songwriter during this time, wrote songs such
   as "Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)" (1978), "This Place Hotel"
   (1980), and "Can You Feel It" (1980).^[47]

   In 1977, Jackson moved to New York City to star as the Scarecrow in The
   Wiz, a musical film directed by Sidney Lumet, alongside Diana Ross,
   Nipsey Russell, and Ted Ross.^[48] The film was a box-office
   failure.^[49] Its score was arranged by Quincy Jones,^[50] who later
   produced three of Jackson's solo albums.^[51] During his time in New
   York, Jackson frequented the Studio 54 nightclub, where he heard early
   hip hop; this influenced his beatboxing on future tracks such as
   "Working Day and Night".^[52] In 1978, Jackson unsatisfied with his
   nose, decided to have a rhinoplasty.^[53] He was referred to Steven
   Hoefflin, who performed Jackson's operations.^[54]

   Jackson's fifth solo album, Off the Wall (1979), established him as a
   solo performer and helped him move from the bubblegum pop of his youth
   to more complex sounds.^[38] It produced four top 10 entries in the US:
   "Off the Wall", "She's Out of My Life", and the chart-topping singles
   "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" and "Rock with You".^[55] The album
   reached number three on the US Billboard 200 and sold over 20 million
   copies worldwide.^[56] In 1980, Jackson won three American Music Awards
   for his solo work: Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Favorite Soul/R&B Male
   Artist, and Favorite Soul/R&B Single for "Don't Stop 'Til You Get
   Enough".^[57]^[58] He also won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal
   Performance for 1979 with "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough".^[59] In
   1981, Jackson was the American Music Awards winner for Favorite
   Soul/R&B Album and Favorite Soul/R&B Male Artist.^[60] Jackson felt Off
   the Wall should have made a bigger impact, and was determined to exceed
   expectations with his next release.^[61] In 1980, he secured the
   highest royalty rate in the music industry: 37 percent of wholesale
   album profit.^[62]

   Yesterday, Today, Forever. British Vogue called Jackson "a fashion
   pioneer [...] who gave new meaning to moonwalking, immortalised
   solitary, [and] sparkly gloves".^[63]

   Jackson recorded with Queen's lead singer Freddie Mercury from 1981 to
   1983, recording demos of "State of Shock", "Victory" and "There Must Be
   More to Life Than This". The recordings were intended for an album of
   duets but, according to Queen's manager Jim Beach, the relationship
   soured when Jackson brought a llama into the recording studio,^[64] and
   Jackson was upset by Mercury's drug use.^[65] "There Must Be More to
   Life Than This" was released in 2014.^[66] Jackson went on to record
   "State of Shock" with Mick Jagger for the Jacksons' album Victory
   (1984).^[67]

   In 1982, Jackson contributed "Someone in the Dark" to the audiobook for
   the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Jackson's sixth album, Thriller,
   was released in late 1982. It was the bestselling album worldwide in
   1983,^[68]^[69] and became the bestselling album of all time in the
   US^[70] and the best-selling album of all time worldwide, selling an
   estimated 70 million copies.^[71]^[72] It topped the Billboard 200
   chart for 37 weeks and was in the top 10 of the 200 for 80 consecutive
   weeks. It was the first album to produce seven Billboard Hot 100 top-10
   singles, including "Billie Jean", "Beat It", and "Wanna Be Startin'
   Somethin'".^[73]

   On March 25, 1983, Jackson reunited with his brothers for Motown 25:
   Yesterday, Today, Forever, an NBC television special. The show aired on
   May 16 to an estimated audience of 47 million, and featured the
   Jacksons and other Motown stars.^[74] Jackson's solo performance of
   "Billie Jean" earned him his first Emmy Award nomination.^[75] Wearing
   a glove decorated with rhinestones,^[76] he debuted his moonwalk dance,
   which Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years earlier, and it became
   his signature dance in his repertoire.^[77] Jackson had originally
   turned down the invitation to the show, believing he had been doing too
   much television. But at the request of Motown founder Berry Gordy, he
   performed in exchange for an opportunity to do a solo performance.^[78]
   Rolling Stone reporter Mikal Gilmore called the performance
   "extraordinary".^[38] Jackson's performance drew comparisons to Elvis
   Presley's and the Beatles' appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show.^[79]
   Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times praised the perfect timing and
   technique involved in the dance.^[80] Gordy described being
   "mesmerized" by the performance.^[81]

   At the 26th Annual Grammy Awards, Thriller won eight awards, and
   Jackson won an award for the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook.
   Winning eight Grammys in one ceremony is a record he holds with the
   band Santana.^[59] Jackson and Quincy Jones won the award for Producer
   of the Year (Non-Classical). Thriller won Album of the Year (with
   Jackson as the album's artist and Jones as its co-producer), and the
   single won Best Pop Vocal Performance (Male) award for Jackson. "Beat
   It" won Record of the Year and Best Rock Vocal Performance (Male).
   "Billie Jean" won two Grammy awards: Best R&B Song and Best R&B Vocal
   Performance (Male), with Jackson as songwriter and singer
   respectively.^[59]

   Thriller won the Grammy for Best Engineered Recording (Non Classical),
   acknowledging Bruce Swedien for his work on the album.^[82] At the 11th
   Annual American Music Awards, Jackson won another eight awards and
   became the youngest artist to win the Award of Merit.^[83] He also won
   Favorite Male Artist, Favorite Soul/R&B Artist, and Favorite Pop/Rock
   Artist. "Beat It" won Favorite Soul/R&B Video, Favorite Pop/Rock Video
   and Favorite Pop/Rock Single. The album won Favorite Soul/R&B Album and
   Favorite Pop/Rock Album.^[83]^[84] Thriller's sales doubled after the
   release of an extended music video, Michael Jackson's Thriller, which
   sees Jackson dancing with a horde of zombies.^[85]^[86]

   The success transformed Jackson into a dominant force in global pop
   culture.^[86] Jackson had the highest royalty rate in the music
   industry at that point, with about $2 for every album sold (equivalent
   to $6 in 2023), and was making record-breaking profits. Dolls modeled
   after Jackson appeared in stores in May 1984 for $12 each.^[87] In the
   same year, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, a documentary
   about the music video, won a Grammy for Best Music Video
   (Longform).^[59] Time described Jackson's influence at that point as
   "star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the
   music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer
   with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all
   boundaries of taste and style and color too."^[87] The New York Times
   wrote "in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is
   everybody else".^[88]

Pepsi incident, "We Are the World" and other commercial activities
(1984–1985)

   In November 1983, Jackson and his brothers partnered with PepsiCo in a
   $5 million promotional deal that broke records for a celebrity
   endorsement (equivalent to $15.3 million in 2023). The first Pepsi
   campaign, which ran in the US from 1983 to 1984 and launched its "New
   Generation" theme, included tour sponsorship, public relations events,
   and in-store displays. Jackson helped to create the advertisement, and
   suggested using his song "Billie Jean", with revised lyrics, as its
   jingle.^[89]

   On January 27, 1984, Michael and other members of the Jacksons filmed a
   Pepsi commercial overseen by Phil Dusenberry,^[90] a BBDO ad agency
   executive, and Alan Pottasch, Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, at
   the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before
   a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on
   fire, causing second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent
   treatment to hide the scars and had his third rhinoplasty shortly
   thereafter.^[91]

   Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5 million
   (equivalent to $4.4 million in 2023) settlement to the Brotman Medical
   Center in Culver City, California; its now-closed Michael Jackson Burn
   Center was named in his honor.^[92]^[93] Jackson signed a second
   agreement with Pepsi in the late 1980s for $10 million (equivalent to
   $26.8 million in 2023). The second campaign covered 20 countries and
   provided financial support for Jackson's Bad album and 1987–88 world
   tour. Jackson had endorsements and advertising deals with other
   companies, such as LA Gear, Suzuki, and Sony, but none were as
   significant as his deals with Pepsi.^[89]

   Stadium, 1984

   The Victory Tour of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson's
   new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last
   tour he did with his brothers.^[94] Following controversy over the
   concert's ticket sales, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an
   estimated $3 to 5 million, to charity.^[95] During the last concert of
   the Victory Tour at the Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, Jackson
   announced his split from the Jacksons during "Shake Your Body".^[96]

   With Lionel Richie, Jackson co-wrote the charity single "We Are the
   World" (1985), which raised money for the poor in the US and
   Africa.^[97]^[98] It earned $63 million (equivalent to $178 million in
   2023),^[98] and became one of the best-selling singles of all time,
   with 20 million copies sold.^[99] It won four Grammy Awards in 1985,
   including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie.^[97] Jackson, Jones,
   and the promoter Ken Kragen received special awards for their roles in
   the song's creation.^[97]^[100]^[101]^[102]

   Jackson collaborated with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s, and
   learned that McCartney was making $40 million a year from owning the
   rights to other artists' songs.^[98] By 1983, Jackson had begun buying
   publishing rights to others' songs, but he was careful with his
   acquisitions, only bidding on a few of the dozens that were offered to
   him. Jackson's early acquisitions of music catalogs and song copyrights
   such as the Sly Stone collection included "Everyday People" (1968), Len
   Barry's "1-2-3" (1965), and Dion DiMucci's "The Wanderer" (1961) and
   "Runaround Sue" (1961).

   In 1984, Robert Holmes à Court announced he was selling the ATV Music
   Publishing catalog comprising the publishing rights to nearly 4,000
   songs, including most of the Beatles' material.^[103] In 1981,
   McCartney had been offered the catalog for £20 million ($40 million)
   (equivalent to $134 million in 2023).^[98]^[104] Jackson submitted a
   bid of $46 million (equivalent to $135 million in 2023) on November 20,
   1984.^[103] When Jackson and McCartney were unable to make a joint
   purchase, McCartney did not want to be the sole owner of the Beatles'
   songs, and did not pursue an offer on his own.^[105]^[104] Jackson's
   agents were unable to come to a deal, and in May 1985 left talks after
   having spent more than $1 million and four months of due diligence work
   on the negotiations.^[103]

   In June 1985, Jackson and Branca learned that Charles Koppelman's and
   Marty Bandier's The Entertainment Company had made a tentative offer to
   buy ATV Music for $50 million; in early August, Holmes à Court
   contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson's increased bid of
   $47.5 million (equivalent to $135 million in 2023) was accepted because
   he could close the deal more quickly, having already completed due
   diligence.^[103] Jackson agreed to visit Holmes à Court in Australia,
   where he would appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon.^[106] His
   purchase of ATV Music was finalized on August 10, 1985.^[98]^[103]

Increased tabloid speculation (1986–1987)

   See also: Health and appearance of Michael Jackson

   Jackson's skin had been medium-brown during his youth, but from the
   mid-1980s gradually grew paler. The change drew widespread media
   coverage, including speculation that he had been bleaching his
   skin.^[107]^[108]^[109] His dermatologist, Arnold Klein, said he
   observed in 1983 that Jackson had vitiligo,^[110] a condition
   characterized by patches of the skin losing their pigment. He also
   identified discoid lupus erythematosus in Jackson. He diagnosed Jackson
   with lupus that year,^[110] and with vitiligo in 1986.^[111] Vitiligo's
   drastic effects on the body can cause psychological distress. Jackson
   used fair-colored makeup,^[112] and possibly skin-bleaching
   prescription creams,^[113] to cover up the uneven blotches of color
   caused by the illness. The creams would depigment the blotches, and,
   with the application of makeup, he could appear very pale.^[114]
   Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and could not
   control his vitiligo, adding, "When people make up stories that I don't
   want to be who I am, it hurts me."^[115] He became friends with Klein
   and Klein's assistant, Debbie Rowe. Rowe later became Jackson's second
   wife and the mother of his first two children.^[116]

   In his 1988 autobiography and a 1993 interview, Jackson said he had had
   two rhinoplasty surgeries and a cleft chin surgery but no more than
   that. He said he lost weight in the early 1980s because of a change in
   diet to achieve a dancer's body.^[117] Witnesses reported that he was
   often dizzy, and speculated he was suffering from anorexia nervosa.
   Periods of weight loss became a recurring problem later in his
   life.^[118] After his death, Jackson's mother said that he first turned
   to cosmetic procedures to remedy his vitiligo, because he did not want
   to look like a "spotted cow". She said he had received more than the
   two cosmetic surgeries he claimed and speculated that he had become
   addicted to them.^[119]

   In 1986, it was reported that Jackson slept in a hyperbaric oxygen
   chamber to slow aging. He denied the story,^[120] although it was
   alleged that Jackson leaked an image of him sleeping in a glass chamber
   (according to Jackson, this was a promotional shot from an upcoming
   space opera featuring himself) to The National Enquirer.^[121] It was
   also reported that Jackson took female hormone shots to keep his voice
   high and facial hair wispy, proposed to Elizabeth Taylor and possibly
   had a shrine of her, and had cosmetic surgery on his eyes. Jackson's
   manager Frank DiLeo denied all of them, except for Jackson having a
   chamber. DiLeo added "I don't know if he sleeps in it. I'm not for it.
   But Michael thinks it's something that's probably healthy for him. He's
   a bit of a health fanatic."^[122]

   When Jackson took his pet chimpanzee Bubbles to tour in Japan, the
   media portrayed Jackson as an aspiring Disney cartoon character who
   befriended animals.^[123] It was also reported that Jackson had offered
   to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick (the "Elephant Man").^[124] In June
   1987, the Chicago Tribune reported Jackson's publicist bidding
   $1 million for the skeleton to the London Hospital Medical College on
   his behalf. The college maintained the skeleton was not for sale. DiLeo
   said Jackson had an "absorbing interest" in Merrick, "purely based on
   his awareness of the ethical, medical and historical
   significance."^[125]

   In September 1986, using the oxygen chamber story, the British tabloid
   The Sun branded Jackson "Wacko Jacko", a name Jackson came to
   despise.^[4]^[126] The Atlantic noted that the name "Jacko" has racist
   connotations, as it originates from Jacko Macacco, a monkey used in
   monkey-baiting matches at the Westminster Pit in the early 1820s, and
   "Jacko" was used in Cockney slang to refer to monkeys in general.^[127]

   Jackson worked with George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola on the
   17-minute $30 million 3D film Captain EO, which ran from 1986 at
   Disneyland and Epcot, and later at Tokyo Disneyland and Euro
   Disneyland.^[128] After having been removed in the late 1990s, it
   returned to the theme park for several years after Jackson's
   death.^[129] In 1987, Ebony reported that Jackson had disassociated
   himself from the Jehovah's Witnesses.^[130] Katherine Jackson said this
   might have been because some Witnesses strongly opposed the Thriller
   video,^[131] which Michael denounced in a Witness publication in
   1984.^[132] In 2001, Jackson told an interviewer he was still a
   Jehovah's Witness.^[133]

Bad, autobiography, and Neverland (1987–1990)

   [170px-George_H._W._Bush_with_Michael_Jackson.png] Jackson and
   President George H. W. Bush at the White House on April 5, 1990. It was
   the second time that Jackson had been honored by a president of the
   United States.

   Jackson's first album in five years, Bad (1987), was highly
   anticipated, with the industry expecting another major success.^[134]
   It became the first album to produce five US number-one singles: "I
   Just Can't Stop Loving You", "Bad", "The Way You Make Me Feel", "Man in
   the Mirror", and "Dirty Diana". Another song, "Smooth Criminal", peaked
   at number seven.^[55] Bad won the 1988 Grammy for Best Engineered
   Recording – Non Classical and the 1990 Grammy Award for Best Music
   Video, Short Form for "Leave Me Alone".^[59]^[82] Jackson won an Award
   of Achievement at the American Music Awards in 1989 after Bad generated
   five number-one singles, became the first album to top the charts in 25
   countries and the bestselling album worldwide in 1987 and
   1988.^[135]^[136] Bad cemented Jackson's status as a dominant music
   force.^[137] The album sold over 35 million copies
   worldwide.^[138]^[139]^[140]

   The Bad World Tour ran from September 12, 1987, to January 27,
   1989.^[141] In Japan, the tour had 14 sellouts and drew 570,000 people,
   nearly tripling the previous record for a single tour.^[142] The
   504,000 people who attended seven sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium set
   a new Guinness World Record.^[143]

   In 1988, Jackson released his autobiography, Moonwalk, with input from
   Stephen Davis and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.^[144] It sold 200,000
   copies,^[145] and reached the top of the New York Times bestsellers
   list.^[146] Jackson discussed his childhood, the Jackson 5, and the
   abuse from his father.^[147] He attributed his changing facial
   appearance to three plastic surgeries, puberty, weight loss, a strict
   vegetarian diet, a change in hairstyle, and stage lighting.^[148]^[117]
   In June, Jackson was honored with the Grand Vermeil Medal of the City
   of Paris by the then Mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac during his stay in
   the city as part of the Bad World Tour.^[149]^[150] On July 20, he
   became the first commoner in history to enter London's Guildhall
   through the building's Royal Entrance.^[151] In October, Jackson
   released a film, Moonwalker, which featured live footage and short
   films starring Jackson and Joe Pesci. In the US it was released
   direct-to-video and became the bestselling video cassette in the
   country.^[152]^[153] The Recording Industry Association of America
   (RIAA) certified it as eight times Platinum in the US.^[154]

   In March 1988, Jackson purchased 2,700 acres (11 km^2) of land near
   Santa Ynez, California, to build a new home, Neverland Ranch, at a cost
   of $17 million (equivalent to $44 million in 2023).^[155] He installed
   a Ferris wheel, a carousel, a movie theater and a
   zoo.^[155]^[156]^[157] A security staff of 40 patrolled the
   grounds.^[156] Shortly afterwards, he appeared in the first Western
   television advertisement in the Soviet Union.^[158]

   Jackson became known as the "King of Pop", a nickname that Jackson's
   publicists embraced.^[18]^[159]^[160] When Elizabeth Taylor presented
   him with the Soul Train Heritage Award in 1989, she called him "the
   true king of pop, rock and soul."^[161] President George H. W. Bush
   designated him the White House's "Artist of the Decade".^[162] At the
   38th BMI Awards in 1990, Jackson was the first person to be honored
   with an award named after its recipient.^[163] From 1985 to 1990,
   Jackson donated $455,000 to the United Negro College Fund,^[164] and
   all profits from his single "Man in the Mirror" went to charity.^[165]
   His rendition of "You Were There" at Sammy Davis Jr.'s 60th birthday
   celebration won Jackson a second Emmy nomination.^[75] Jackson was the
   bestselling artist of the 1980s.^[166]

Dangerous and public social work (1991–1993)

   In March 1991, Jackson renewed his contract with Sony for $65 million
   (equivalent to $145 million in 2023), a record-breaking deal,^[167]
   beating Neil Diamond's renewal contract with Columbia Records.^[168] In
   1991, he released his eighth album, Dangerous, co-produced with Teddy
   Riley.^[169] It was certified eight times platinum in the US, and by
   2018 had sold 32 million copies worldwide.^[170]^[171] In the US, the
   first single, "Black or White", was the album's highest-charting song;
   it was number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for seven weeks and achieved
   similar chart performances worldwide.^[172] The second single,
   "Remember the Time" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100
   singles chart.^[173] At the end of 1992, Dangerous was the bestselling
   album of the year worldwide and "Black or White" the bestselling single
   of the year worldwide at the Billboard Music Awards.^[166] In 1993, he
   performed "Remember the Time" at the Soul Train Music Awards in a
   chair, saying he twisted his ankle during dance rehearsals.^[174] In
   the UK, "Heal the World" made No. 2 on the charts in 1992.^[175]

   Jackson founded the Heal the World Foundation in 1992. The charity
   brought underprivileged children to Jackson's ranch to use the theme
   park rides, and sent millions of dollars around the globe to help
   children threatened by war, poverty, and disease. That July, Jackson
   published his second book, Dancing the Dream, a collection of poetry.
   The Dangerous World Tour ran between June 1992 and November 1993 and
   grossed $100 million (equivalent to $210 million in 2023); Jackson
   performed for over 3.5 million people in 70 concerts, all of which were
   outside the US.^[176]^[177] Part of the proceeds went to Heal the World
   Foundation.^[178] Jackson sold the broadcast rights of the tour to HBO
   for $20 million, a record-breaking deal that still stands.^[179]

   Following the death of HIV/AIDS spokesperson and friend Ryan White,
   Jackson pleaded with the Clinton administration at Bill Clinton's
   inaugural gala to give more money to HIV/AIDS charities and
   research^[180]^[181] and performed "Gone Too Soon", a song dedicated to
   White, and "Heal the World" at the gala.^[182] Jackson visited Africa
   in early 1992; on his first stop in Gabon he was greeted by more than
   100,000 people, some of them carrying signs that read "Welcome Home
   Michael",^[183] and was awarded an Officer of the National Order of
   Merit from President Omar Bongo.^[184]^[185] During his trip to Ivory
   Coast, Jackson drew larger crowds than Pope John Paul II on his
   previous visits.^[186] He was crowned "King Sani" by a tribal chief in
   the Ivorian village of Krindjabo, where he thanked the dignitaries in
   French and English, signed documents formalizing his kingship, and sat
   on a golden throne while presiding over ceremonial dances.^[183]

   In January 1993, Jackson performed at the Super Bowl XXVII halftime
   show in Pasadena, California. The NFL sought a big-name artist to keep
   ratings high during halftime following dwindling audience
   figures.^[187]^[188] With 133.4 million viewers, it was the first Super
   Bowl whose halftime show drew greater audience figures than the
   game.^[189] Jackson played "Jam", "Billie Jean", "Black or White", and
   "Heal the World". Dangerous rose 90 places in the US albums chart after
   the performance.^[107]

   Jackson gave a 90-minute interview with Oprah Winfrey on February 10,
   1993. He spoke of his childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he
   believed he had missed out on much of his childhood, and said that he
   often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had
   bought the bones of the Elephant Man, slept in a hyperbaric oxygen
   chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated for the first time that he
   had vitiligo. After the interview, Dangerous re-entered the US albums
   chart in the top 10, more than a year after its release.^[18]^[107] The
   interview itself became the most-watched television interview in United
   States history to date, with more than 90 million viewers.^[190]

   In January 1993, Jackson won three American Music Awards: Favorite
   Pop/Rock Album (Dangerous), Favorite Soul/R&B Single ("Remember the
   Time"), and was the first to win the International Artist Award of
   Excellence.^[191]^[192] In February, he won the "Living Legend Award"
   at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles.^[59] He attended the
   award ceremony with Brooke Shields.^[193] Dangerous was nominated for
   Best Vocal Performance (for "Black or White"), Best R&B Vocal
   Performance ("Jam") and Best R&B Song ("Jam"), and Bruce Swedien and
   Teddy Riley won the Grammy for Best Engineered – Non Classical.^[82]

First child sexual abuse accusations and first marriage (1993–1995)

   Main article: 1993 Michael Jackson sexual abuse allegations

   In August 1993, Jackson was accused of child sexual abuse by a
   13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, and his father, Evan Chandler.^[194]
   Jordan said he and Jackson had engaged in acts of kissing, masturbation
   and oral sex.^[195] While Jordan's mother initially told police that
   she did not believe Jackson had molested him, her position wavered a
   few days later.^[151]^[196] Evan was recorded discussing his intention
   to pursue charges, which Jackson used to argue that he was the victim
   of a jealous father trying to extort money.^[196] Jackson's older
   sister La Toya accused him of being a pedophile;^[197] she later
   retracted this, saying she had been forced into it by her abusive
   husband.^[198]

   Police raided Jackson's home in August and found two legal large-format
   art books featuring young boys playing, running and swimming in various
   states of undress.^[199] Jackson denied knowing of the books' content
   and claimed if they were there, someone had to have sent them to him
   and he did not open them.^[200] Jordan Chandler gave police a
   description of Jackson's genitals. A strip search was made, and the
   jurors felt the description was not a match.^[201]^[202]^[203] In
   January 1994, Jackson settled with the Chandlers out of court for a
   reported total sum of $23 million.^[204] The police never pressed
   criminal charges.^[205] Citing a lack of evidence without Jordan's
   testimony, the state closed its investigation on September 22,
   1994.^[206]

   Jackson had been taking painkillers for his reconstructive scalp
   surgeries, administered due to the Pepsi commercial accident in 1984,
   and became dependent on them to cope with the stress of the sexual
   abuse allegations.^[207] On November 12, 1993, Jackson canceled the
   remainder of the Dangerous World Tour due to health problems, stress
   from the allegations and painkiller addiction. He thanked his close
   friend Elizabeth Taylor for support, encouragement and counsel. The end
   of the tour concluded his sponsorship deal with Pepsi.^[208]

   In late 1993, Jackson proposed to Lisa Marie Presley, the daughter of
   Elvis Presley, over the phone.^[209] They were married in La Vega,
   Dominican Republic, in May 1994 by civil judge Hugo Francisco Álvarez
   Pérez.^[210] The tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a
   publicity stunt to deflect away from Jackson's sexual abuse allegations
   and jump-start Presley's career as a singer.^[211]^[210] Their marriage
   ended little more than a year later, and they separated in December
   1995.^[212] Presley cited "irreconcilable differences" when filing for
   divorce the next month and only sought to reclaim her maiden name as
   her settlement.^[211]^[213] After the divorce, Judge Pérez said, "They
   lasted longer than I thought they would. I gave them a year. They
   lasted a year and a half."^[210] Presley later said she and Jackson had
   attempted to reconcile intermittently for four years following their
   divorce, and that she had traveled the world to be with him.^[214]

   Jackson composed music for the Sega Genesis video game Sonic the
   Hedgehog 3 (1994), but left the project around the time the sexual
   abuse allegations surfaced and went uncredited.^[215]^[216] The Sega
   Technical Institute director Roger Hector and the Sonic co-creator
   Naoto Ohshima said that Jackson's involvement was terminated and his
   music reworked following the allegations.^[217]^[218] However,
   Jackson's musical director Brad Buxer and other members of Jackson's
   team said Jackson went uncredited because he was unhappy with how the
   Genesis replicated his music.^[219]

HIStory, second marriage, fatherhood and Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in
the Mix (1995–1997)

   Festival for the premiere of Michael Jackson's Ghosts

   In June 1995, Jackson released the double album HIStory: Past, Present
   and Future, Book I. The first disc, HIStory Begins, is a greatest hits
   album (reissued in 2001 as Greatest Hits: HIStory, Volume I). The
   second disc, HIStory Continues, contains 13 original songs and two
   cover versions. The album debuted at number one on the charts and has
   been certified for eight million shipments in the US.^[220] It is the
   bestselling multi-disc album of all time, with 20 million copies
   (40 million units) sold worldwide.^[172]^[221] HIStory received a
   Grammy nomination for Album of the Year.^[59] The New York Times
   reviewed it as "the testimony of a musician whose self-pity now equals
   his talent".^[222]

   The first single from HIStory was "Scream/Childhood". "Scream", a duet
   with Jackson's youngest sister Janet, protests the media's treatment of
   Jackson during the 1993 child abuse allegations against him. The single
   reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100,^[173] and received a
   Grammy nomination for "Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals".^[59] The
   second single, "You Are Not Alone", holds the Guinness world record for
   the first song to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100
   chart.^[223] It received a Grammy nomination for "Best Pop Vocal
   Performance" in 1995.^[59]

   In 1995 the Anti-Defamation League and other groups complained that
   "Jew me, sue me, everybody do me/ Kick me, kike me, don't you black or
   white me", the original lyrics of "They Don't Care About Us", were
   antisemitic. Jackson released a revised version of the song.^[224]

   In late 1995, Jackson was admitted to a hospital after collapsing
   during rehearsals for a televised performance, caused by a
   stress-related panic attack.^[225] In November, Jackson merged his ATV
   Music catalog with Sony's music publishing division, creating Sony/ATV
   Music Publishing. He retained ownership of half the company, earning
   $95 million up front (equivalent to $190 million in 2023) as well as
   the rights to more songs.^[226]^[227]

   "Earth Song" was the third single released from HIStory, and topped the
   UK Singles Chart for six weeks over Christmas 1995.^[175] It became the
   87th-bestselling single in the UK.^[228] At the 1996 Brit Awards,
   Jackson's performance of "Earth Song" was disrupted by Pulp singer
   Jarvis Cocker, who was protesting what Cocker saw as Jackson's
   "Christ-like" persona. Jackson said the stage invasion was "disgusting
   and cowardly".^[229]^[230]

   In 1996, Jackson won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form, for
   "Scream" and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male
   Artist.^[59]^[231] In July 1996, Jackson performed for Sultan Hassanal
   Bolkiah's fiftieth birthday at Jerudong Park Amphitheater, which was
   specifically built for that birthday concert.^[232] Jackson was
   reportedly paid $17 million (equivalent to $33 million in 2023).^[233]
   Jackson promoted HIStory with the HIStory World Tour, from September 7,
   1996, to October 15, 1997. He performed 82 concerts in five continents,
   35 countries and 58 cities to over 4.5 million fans, his most attended
   tour. It grossed $165 million.^[141] During the tour, in Sydney,
   Australia, Jackson married Debbie Rowe, a dermatology assistant, who
   was six months pregnant with his first child.^[234]

   Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. (commonly known as Prince) was born on
   February 13, 1997. His sister Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson was born
   on April 3, 1998.^[235] Jackson and Rowe divorced in 2000, Rowe
   conceded custody of the children, with an $8 million settlement
   (equivalent to $14.6 million in 2023).^[236] In 2004, after the second
   child abuse allegations against Jackson, she returned to court to
   reclaim custody. The suit was settled in 2006.^[237]

   In 1997, Jackson released Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix,
   which contained remixes of singles from HIStory and five new songs.
   Worldwide sales stand at 6 million copies, making it the best-selling
   remix album. It reached number one in the UK, as did the single "Blood
   on the Dance Floor".^[238] In the US, the album reached number 24 and
   was certified platinum.^[170]

Label dispute and Invincible (1997–2002)

   From October 1997 to September 2001, Jackson worked on his tenth solo
   album, Invincible, which cost $30 million (equivalent to $51.6 million
   in 2023) to record, making it the most expensive album of all
   time.^[239] In June 1999, Jackson joined Luciano Pavarotti for a War
   Child benefit concert in Modena, Italy. The show raised a million
   dollars for refugees of the Kosovo War, and additional funds for the
   children of Guatemala.^[240] Later that month, Jackson organized a
   series of "Michael Jackson & Friends" benefit concerts in Germany and
   Korea. Other artists involved included Slash, The Scorpions, Boyz II
   Men, Luther Vandross, Mariah Carey, A. R. Rahman, Prabhu Deva Sundaram,
   Shobana, Andrea Bocelli and Luciano Pavarotti. The proceeds went to the
   Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, the Red Cross and UNESCO.^[241] In
   1999, Jackson was presented with the "Outstanding Humanitarian Award"
   at Bollywood Movie Awards in New York City where he noted Mahatma
   Gandhi to have been an inspiration for him.^[242]^[243] From August
   1999 to 2000, he lived in New York City at 4 East 74th Street.^[244] At
   the turn of the century, Jackson was awarded with the Artist of the
   1980s Decade Award at the 27th American Music Awards,^[245] and the
   Best-Selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium Award at the 12nd World
   Music Awards.^[246] In 2000, Guinness World Records recognized him for
   supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer.^[247]

   In September 2001, two concerts were held at Madison Square Garden to
   mark Jackson's 30th year as a solo artist. Jackson performed with his
   brothers for the first time since 1984. The show also featured Mýa,
   Usher, Whitney Houston, Destiny's Child, Monica, Liza Minnelli and
   Slash. The first show was marred by technical lapses, and the crowd
   booed a speech by Marlon Brando.^[248] 45 million people watched the
   television broadcast of the shows in November according to Nielsen
   Media Research.^[249] After the September 11 attacks (in which Jackson
   narrowly avoided death by oversleeping and missing a scheduled meeting
   at the World Trade Center^[250]), Jackson helped organize the United We
   Stand: What More Can I Give benefit concert at Robert F. Kennedy
   Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C., on October 21, 2001. Jackson
   performed "What More Can I Give" as the finale.^[251]

   The release of Invincible was preceded by a dispute between Jackson and
   his record label, Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had expected the
   licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him in the early
   2000s, after which he would be able to promote the material however he
   pleased and keep the profits, but clauses in the contract set the
   revert date years into the future. Jackson sought an early exit from
   his contract.^[252] Invincible was released on October 30, 2001. It was
   Jackson's first full-length album in six years, and the last album of
   original material he released in his lifetime.^[252] It debuted at
   number one in 13 countries, and went on to sell eight million copies
   worldwide, receiving double-platinum certification in the
   US.^[170]^[253]^[254]

   On January 9, 2002, Jackson won his 22nd American Music Award for
   Artist of the Century.^[255]^[256] Later that year, an anonymous
   surrogate mother gave birth to his third child, Prince Michael Jackson
   II (nicknamed "Blanket"^[nb 3]), who had been conceived by artificial
   insemination.^[257] On November 20, Jackson briefly held Blanket over
   the railing of his Berlin hotel room, four stories above ground level,
   prompting widespread criticism in the media. Jackson apologized for the
   incident, calling it "a terrible mistake".^[258] On January 22,
   promoter Marcel Avram filed a breach of contract complaint against
   Jackson for failing to perform two planned 1999 concerts.^[259] In
   March, a Santa Maria jury ordered Jackson to pay Avram
   $5.3 million.^[260]^[261] On December 18, 2003, Jackson's attorneys
   dropped all appeals on the verdict and settled the lawsuit for an
   undisclosed amount.^[262]

   On April 24, 2002, Jackson performed at Apollo Theater. The concert was
   a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and former President
   Bill Clinton.^[263] The money collected would be used to encourage
   citizens to vote. It raised $2.5 million.^[264] The concert was called
   Michael Jackson: Live at the Apollo and was one of Jackson's final
   on-stage performances.^[265]

   In July 2002, at Al Sharpton's National Action Network in Harlem,
   Jackson called the Sony Music chairman Tommy Mottola "a racist, and
   very, very, very devilish", and accused him of exploiting black artists
   for his own gain. The accusation prompted Sharpton to form a coalition
   investigating whether Mottola exploited black artists.^[266] Jackson
   charged that Mottola had called his colleague Irv Gotti a "fat
   nigger".^[267] Sony issued a statement calling the accusations
   "ludicrous, spiteful, and hurtful" and said Mottola had championed
   Jackson's career for years.^[266] Sony refused to renew Jackson's
   contract and said that a $25 million promotional campaign had failed
   because Jackson refused to tour in the US for Invincible.^[239]

   Beginning in May 2002, a documentary film crew led by Martin Bashir
   followed Jackson for several months.^[258] The documentary, broadcast
   in February 2003 as Living with Michael Jackson, showed Jackson holding
   hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with a twelve-year-old
   boy.^[17]^[268] He said that he saw nothing wrong with having
   sleepovers with minors and sharing his bed and bedroom with various
   people, which aroused controversy. He insisted that the sleepovers were
   not sexual and that his words had been misunderstood.^[269]^[270]

   In October 2003, Jackson received the Key to the City of Las Vegas from
   Mayor Oscar Goodman.^[271] On November 18, 2003, Sony released Number
   Ones, a greatest hits compilation. It was certified five times platinum
   by the RIAA, and ten times platinum in the UK, for shipments of at
   least 3 million units.^[170]^[272]

   On December 18, 2003, Santa Barbara authorities charged Jackson with
   seven counts of child molestation and two counts of intoxicating a
   minor with alcoholic drinks.^[273] Jackson denied the allegations and
   pleaded not guilty.^[274] The People v. Jackson trial began on January
   31, 2005, in Santa Maria, California, and lasted until the end of May.
   Jackson found the experience stressful and it affected his health. If
   convicted, he would have faced up to twenty years in prison.^[275] On
   June 13, 2005, Jackson was acquitted on all counts.^[276] FBI files on
   Jackson, released in 2009, revealed the FBI's role in the 2005 trial
   and the 1993 allegations, and showed that the FBI found no evidence of
   criminal conduct on Jackson's behalf.^[277]^[278]

   After the trial, Jackson became reclusive.^[279] In June 2005, he moved
   to Bahrain as a guest of Sheikh Abdullah.^[280] In early 2006, it was
   announced that Jackson had signed a contract with a Bahrain startup,
   Two Seas Records. Nothing came of the deal, and the Two Seas CEO, Guy
   Holmes, later said it was never finalized.^[281]^[282] Holmes also
   found that Jackson was on the verge of bankruptcy and was involved in
   47 ongoing lawsuits.^[280] By September 2006, Jackson was no longer
   affiliated with Two Seas.^[282]

   In April 2006, Jackson agreed to use a piece of his ATV catalog stake,
   then worth about $1 billion, as collateral against his $270 million
   worth of loans from Bank of America. Bank of America had sold the loans
   to Fortress Investments, an investment company that buys distressed
   loans, the year before. As part of the agreement, Fortress Investments
   provided Jackson a new loan of $300 million with reduced interest
   payments (equivalent to $450 million in 2023). Sony Music would have
   the option to buy half of his stake, or about 25% of the catalog, at a
   set price. Jackson's financial managers had urged him to shed part of
   his stake to avoid bankruptcy.^[227]^[283] The main house at Neverland
   Ranch was closed as a cost-cutting measure, while Jackson lived in
   Bahrain at the hospitality of Abdullah.^[284] At least thirty of
   Jackson's employees had not been paid on time and were owed $306,000 in
   back wages. Jackson was ordered to pay $100,000 in penalties.^[227]
   Jackson never returned to Neverland after his acquittal.^[285]

   In mid-2006, Jackson moved to Grouse Lodge, a residential recording
   studio near Rosemount, County Westmeath, Ireland. There, he began work
   on a new album with the American producers will.i.am and Rodney
   Jenkins.^[286] That November, Jackson invited an Access Hollywood
   camera crew into the studio in Westmeath.^[172] On November 15, Jackson
   briefly joined in on a performance of "We Are the World" at the World
   Music Awards in London, his last public performance, and accepted the
   Diamond Award for sales of 100 million records.^[172]^[287] He returned
   to the US in December, settling in Las Vegas. That month, he attended
   James Brown's funeral in Augusta, Georgia, where he gave a eulogy
   calling Brown his greatest inspiration.^[288]

   In 2007, Jackson and Sony bought another music publishing company,
   Famous Music LLC, formerly owned by Viacom. The deal gave Jackson the
   rights to songs by Eminem and Beck, among others.^[289]^[290] In a
   brief interview, Jackson said he had no regrets about his career
   despite his problems and "deliberate attempts to hurt [him]".^[291]
   That March, Jackson visited a US Army post in Japan, Camp Zama, to
   greet more than 3,000 troops and their families.^[292]^[293] As of
   September, Jackson was still working on his next album, which he never
   completed.^[294]

   In 2008, for the 25th anniversary of Thriller, Jackson and Sony
   released Thriller 25, with two remixes released as singles: "The Girl
   Is Mine 2008" and "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 2008".^[295] For
   Jackson's 50th birthday, Sony BMG released a series of greatest hits
   albums, King of Pop, with different tracklists for different
   regions.^[296] That July, Fortress Investments threatened to foreclose
   on Neverland Ranch, which Jackson had used as collateral for his loans.
   Fortress sold Jackson's debts to Colony Capital LLC.^[297]^[298] In
   November, Jackson transferred Neverland Ranch's title to Sycamore
   Valley Ranch Company LLC, a joint venture between Jackson and Colony
   Capital LLC. The deal earned him $35 million.^[299] In 2009, Jackson
   arranged to sell a collection of his memorabilia of more than 1,000
   items through Julien's Auction House, but canceled the auction in
   April.^[300]

   In March 2009, amid speculation about his finances and health, Jackson
   announced a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, at a press
   conference at the O2 Arena.^[301] The shows were to be his first major
   concerts since the HIStory World Tour in 1997. Jackson suggested he
   would retire after the shows. The initial plan was for ten concerts in
   London, followed by shows in Paris, New York City and Mumbai. Randy
   Phillips, the president and chief executive of AEG Live, predicted the
   first ten dates would earn Jackson £50 million.^[302]

   The London residency was increased to fifty dates after record-breaking
   ticket sales; more than one million were sold in less than two
   hours.^[303] The concerts were to run from July 13, 2009, to March 6,
   2010. Jackson moved to Los Angeles, where he rehearsed in the weeks
   leading up to the tour under the direction of the choreographer Kenny
   Ortega, whom he had worked with during his previous tours. Rehearsals
   took place at the Forum and the Staples Center owned by AEG.^[304] By
   this point, Jackson's debt had grown to almost $500 million. By the
   time of his death, he was three or four months behind payments on his
   home in San Fernando Valley.^[305]^[306] The Independent reported that
   Jackson planned a string of further ventures designed to recoup his
   debts, including a world tour, a new album, films, a museum and a
   casino.^[301]

   On June 25, 2009, less than three weeks before his concert residency
   was due to begin in London, with all concerts sold out, Jackson died
   from cardiac arrest, caused by a propofol and benzodiazepine
   overdose.^[307]^[308] Conrad Murray, his personal physician, had given
   Jackson various medications to help him sleep at his rented mansion in
   Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. Paramedics received a 911 call at 12:21 pm
   Pacific time (19:21 UTC) and arrived at the property four minutes
   later.^[309] Jackson was not breathing and CPR was performed.^[310]
   Resuscitation efforts continued en route to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical
   Center, and for more than an hour after Jackson's arrival there, but
   were unsuccessful,^[311]^[312] and Jackson was pronounced dead at
   2:26 pm Pacific time (21:26 UTC).^[313]^[314] Murray had administered
   propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam;^[315] Jackson's death was caused by
   a propofol overdose.^[308]^[312]

   News of his death spread quickly online, causing websites to slow down
   and crash from user overload,^[316] and it put unprecedented
   strain^[317] on many services and websites including Google,^[318] AOL
   Instant Messenger,^[317] Twitter and Wikipedia.^[318] Overall, web
   traffic rose by between 11% and 20%.^[319]^[320] MTV and BET aired
   marathons of Jackson's music videos,^[321] and Jackson specials aired
   on television stations around the world.^[322] MTV briefly returned to
   its original music video format,^[5] and they aired hours of Jackson's
   music videos, with live news specials featuring reactions from MTV
   personalities and other celebrities.^[323]

   Jackson's memorial was held on July 7, 2009, at the Staples Center in
   Los Angeles, preceded by a private family service at Forest Lawn
   Memorial Park's Hall of Liberty. Over 1.6 million fans applied for
   tickets to the memorial; the 8,750 recipients were drawn at random, and
   each received two tickets.^[324] The memorial service was one of the
   most watched events in streaming history,^[325] with an estimated US
   audience of 31.1 million^[326] and a worldwide audience of an estimated
   2.5 to 3 billion.^[327]^[328]

   Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, Jennifer Hudson, and
   Shaheen Jafargholi performed at the memorial, and Smokey Robinson and
   Queen Latifah gave eulogies.^[329] Al Sharpton received a standing
   ovation with cheers when he told Jackson's children: "Wasn't nothing
   strange about your daddy. It was strange what your daddy had to deal
   with. But he dealt with it anyway."^[330] Jackson's 11-year-old
   daughter Paris Katherine, speaking publicly for the first time, wept as

   Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.^[334]

Criminal investigation and prosecution of Conrad Murray

   Main article: People v. Murray

   In August 2009, the Los Angeles County Coroner ruled that Jackson's
   death was a homicide.^[335]^[336] Law enforcement officials charged
   Murray with involuntary manslaughter on February 8, 2010.^[337] In late
   2011, he was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter^[338] and held
   without bail to await sentencing.^[339] Murray was sentenced to four
   years in prison, but was released after one year and eleven
   months.^[340]

Posthumous sales

   At the 2009 American Music Awards, Jackson won four posthumous awards,
   including two for his compilation album Number Ones, bringing his total
   American Music Awards to 26.^[341]^[342] In the year after his death,
   more than 16.1 million copies of Jackson's albums were sold in the US
   alone, and 35 million copies were sold worldwide, more than any other
   artist in 2009.^[343]^[344] He became the first artist to sell one
   million music downloads in a week, with 2.6 million song downloads.
   Thriller, Number Ones and The Essential Michael Jackson became the
   first catalog albums to outsell any new album.^[345] Jackson also
   became the first artist to have four of the top-20 bestselling albums
   in a single year in the US.^[346] Within the year following his death,
   Jackson sold over 75 million records worldwide.^[347] By the end of
   2013, Jackson had sold over 50 million albums worldwide since his
   death.^[348]

   Following the surge in sales, in March 2010, Sony Music signed a
   $250 million deal (equivalent to $350 million in 2023) with the Jackson
   estate to extend their distribution rights to Jackson's back catalog
   until at least 2017; it had been due to expire in 2015. It was the most
   expensive music contract for a single artist in history.^[349]^[350]
   They agreed to release ten albums of previously unreleased material and
   new collections of released work.^[349]^[351] The deal was extended in
   2017.^[352] That July, a Los Angeles court awarded Quincy Jones
   $9.4 million of disputed royalty payments for Off the Wall, Thriller,
   and Bad.^[51] In July 2018, Sony/ATV bought the estate's stake in EMI
   for $287.5 million.^[353]

   In 2014, Jackson became the first artist to have a top-ten single in
   the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades.^[354] The following
   year, Thriller became the first album to be certified for 30 million
   shipments by the Recording Industry Association of America
   (RIAA).^[355] A year later, it was certified 33× platinum after
   Soundscan added streams and audio downloads to album
   certifications.^[356]^[nb 4]

   In February 2024, Sony Music acquired half of Jackson's publishing
   rights and recording masters for an estimated $600 million. The deal
   includes assets from Jackson's Mijac publishing catalog, but excludes
   royalties from several Jackson-related productions, including the MJ
   Broadway musical and the Michael biopic. The deal is possibly the
   largest transaction ever for a single musician's work.^[358]^[359]

Posthumous releases and productions

   Jackson's posthumous releases and productions are administered by the
   estate of Michael Jackson, which owns Jackson's trademarks and rights
   to his name, image and likeness.^[360] The first posthumous Jackson
   song, "This Is It", co-written in the 1980s with Paul Anka, was
   released in October 2009. The surviving Jackson brothers reunited to
   record backing vocals.^[361] It was followed by a documentary film
   about the rehearsals for the canceled This Is It tour, Michael
   Jackson's This Is It,^[362] and a compilation album.^[363] Despite a
   limited two-week engagement, the film became the highest-grossing
   documentary or concert film ever, with earnings of more than $260
   million worldwide.^[364] Jackson's estate received 90% of the
   profits.^[365] In late 2010, Sony released the first posthumous album,
   Michael, and the lead single "Hold My Hand", a duet with Akon. The
   Jackson collaborator will.i.am expressed disgust, saying that Jackson
   would not have approved the release.^[366]

   The video game developer Ubisoft released a music game featuring
   Jackson for the 2010 holiday season, Michael Jackson: The Experience.
   It was among the first games to use Kinect and PlayStation Move, the
   motion-detecting camera systems for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.^[367]
   In April 2011, Mohamed Al-Fayed, the chairman of Fulham Football Club,
   unveiled a statue of Jackson outside the club stadium, Craven
   Cottage.^[368] It was moved to the National Football Museum in
   Manchester in May 2014,^[369] and removed from display in March 2019
   following renewed sexual assault allegations.^[370]

   In October 2011, the theater company Cirque du Soleil launched Michael
   Jackson: The Immortal World Tour, a $57-million production,^[371] in
   Montreal, with a permanent show resident in Las Vegas.^[372] A larger
   and more theatrical Cirque show, Michael Jackson: One, designed for
   residency at the Mandalay Bay resort in Las Vegas, opened on May 23,
   2013, in a renovated theater.^[373]^[374]

   In 2012, in an attempt to end a family dispute, Jackson's brother
   Jermaine retracted his signature on a public letter criticizing
   executors of Jackson's estate and his mother's advisors over the
   legitimacy of his brother's will.^[375] T.J. Jackson, the son of Tito
   Jackson, was given co-guardianship of Michael Jackson's children after
   false reports of Katherine Jackson going missing.^[376] Xscape, an
   album of unreleased material, was released on May 13, 2014.^[377] The
   lead single, a duet between Jackson and Justin Timberlake, "Love Never
   Felt So Good", reached number 9 on the US Billboard Hot 100, making
   Jackson the first artist to have a top-10 single on the chart in five
   different decades.^[378]

   Later in 2014, Queen released a duet recorded with Jackson in the
   1980s.^[66] A compilation album, Scream, was released on September 29,
   2017.^[379] A jukebox musical, MJ the Musical, premiered on Broadway in
   2022.^[380] Myles Frost won the 2022 Tony Award for Best Actor in a
   Musical for his portrayal of Jackson.^[381] On November 18, 2022, Epic
   released a 40th-anniversary edition reissue of Thriller.^[382]^[383] A
   biographical film based on Jackson's life, Michael, directed by Antoine
   Fuqua, is scheduled for April 2025.^[384] Jackson is played by his
   nephew Jaafar Jackson. Deadline Hollywood reported that the film "will
   not shy away from the controversies of Jackson's life".^[385] Since
   Jackson's death his estate has grossed $2 billion in ticket revenue
   from MJ the Musical, Michael Jackson's This Is It and two Cirque du
   Soleil productions.^[386]

Posthumous child sexual abuse allegations

   In 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a lawsuit alleging that
   Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was
   seven years old (1989–1996).^[387] In 2014, a case was filed by James
   Safechuck, alleging similar sexual abuse over a four-year period
   starting when Safechuck was ten (1988–1992).^[388]^[389]^[390] Both had
   previously testified in Jackson's defense during the 1993 allegations;
   Robson did so again in 2005.^[391]^[392] In 2015, Robson's case against
   Jackson's estate was dismissed as it had been filed too late.
   Safechuck's claim was also time-barred.^[393]

   In 2017, it was ruled that Jackson's corporations could not be held
   accountable for his alleged past actions.^[394]^[395] The rulings were
   appealed. On October 20, 2020, Safechuck's lawsuit against Jackson's
   corporations was again dismissed. The judge ruled that there was no
   evidence that Safechuck had had a relationship with Jackson's
   corporation, nor was it proven that there was a special relationship
   between the two.^[396]^[397]^[398]^[399] On April 26, 2021, Robson's
   case was dismissed because of a lack of supporting evidence that the
   defendants exercised control over Jackson.^[400]

   Robson and Safechuck's allegations were the subject of the documentary
   film Leaving Neverland, released in March 2019.^[401] Radio stations in
   New Zealand, Canada, the UK and the Netherlands removed Jackson's music
   from their playlists.^[402]^[403]^[404] Jackson's family condemned the
   film as a "public lynching",^[405] and the Jackson estate released a
   statement calling the film a "tabloid character assassination [Jackson]
   endured in life, and now in death".^[406] Close associates of Jackson,
   such as Corey Feldman, Aaron Carter, Brett Barnes, and Macaulay Culkin,
   defended Jackson in the wake of the documentary's release, saying that
   Jackson had never molested them.^[407]^[408]^[409]

   Documentaries such as Square One: Michael Jackson, Neverland Firsthand:
   Investigating the Michael Jackson Documentary and Michael Jackson:
   Chase the Truth, presented information countering the claims suggested
   by Leaving Neverland.^[410]^[411]^[412] Jackson's album sales increased
   following the documentary screenings.^[413] Billboard senior editor
   Gail Mitchell said she and a colleague interviewed about thirty music
   executives who believed Jackson's legacy could withstand the
   controversy.^[414] In late 2019, some New Zealand and Canadian radio
   stations re-added Jackson's music to their playlists, citing "positive
   listener survey results".^[415]^[416]

   On February 21, 2019, the Jackson estate sued HBO for breaching a
   non-disparagement clause from a 1992 contract. The suit sought to
   compel HBO to participate in a non-confidential arbitration that could
   result in $100 million or more in damages awarded to the estate.^[417]
   HBO said they did not breach a contract and filed an anti-SLAPP motion
   against the estate. In September 2019, Judge George H. Wu denied HBO's
   motion to dismiss the case, allowing the Jackson estate to
   arbitrate.^[418] HBO appealed, but in December 2020 the appeals court
   affirmed Wu's ruling.^[419]

   In 2020, a state law passed in California which granted plaintiffs in
   child sex abuse cases an additional period to file lawsuits. In October
   2020 and again in April 2021, the Los Angeles County Superior Court
   ruled that MJJ Productions Inc. and MJJ Ventures Inc. employees were
   not legally obligated to protect the two men from Jackson. In August
   2023, California's Second District Court of Appeal overturned the
   ruling, and the case was approved to move forward to trial court.^[420]

   Tussauds, London in 1992

   Jackson has been referred to as the "King of Pop" for having
   transformed the art of music videos and paving the way for modern pop
   music. For much of Jackson's career, he had an unparalleled worldwide
   influence over the younger generation.^[421] His influence extended
   beyond the music industry; he impacted dance, led fashion trends, and
   raised awareness for global affairs.^[422] Jackson's music and videos
   fostered racial diversity in MTV's roster and steered its focus from
   rock to pop music and R&B, leading to the discontinuation of the
   album-oriented rock format previously dominant on the
   channel.^[38]^[423] In songs such as "Black or White", "Heal the
   World", "Earth Song" and "They Don't Care About Us", Jackson's music
   emphasized racial integration and environmentalism and protested
   injustice.^[424]^[425] He is recognized as the Most Successful
   Entertainer of All Time by Guinness World Records.^[426]^[427] Jackson
   has also appeared on Rolling Stone's lists of the Greatest Singers of
   All Time.^[428]^[429] He is considered one of the most significant
   cultural figures of the 20th century,^[430] and his contributions to
   music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life,
   made him a global figure in popular culture for over four
   decades.^[431]^[432]^[433]

     Trying to trace Michael Jackson's influence on the pop stars that
     followed him is like trying to trace the influence of oxygen and
     gravity. So vast, far-reaching and was his impact—particularly in
     the wake of Thriller's colossal and heretofore unmatched commercial
     success—that there weren't a whole lot of artists who weren't trying
     to mimic some of the Jackson formula.

   — J. Edward Keyes of Rolling Stone^[434]

   Danyel Smith, chief content officer of Vibe Media Group and the
   editor-in-chief of Vibe, described Jackson as "the greatest
   star".^[435] Steve Huey of AllMusic called him "an unstoppable
   juggernaut, possessed of all the skills to dominate the charts
   seemingly at will: an instantly identifiable voice, eye-popping dance
   moves, stunning musical versatility and loads of sheer star power".^[4]
   BET said Jackson was "quite simply the greatest entertainer of all
   time" whose "sound, style, movement and legacy continues to inspire
   artists of all genres".^[436] In 1984, Time pop critic Jay Cocks wrote
   that "Jackson is the biggest thing since the Beatles. He is the hottest
   single phenomenon since Elvis Presley. He just may be the most popular
   black singer ever." He described Jackson as a "star of records, radio,
   rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter
   who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the
   street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style, and
   color too."^[87] In 2003, The Daily Telegraph writer Tom Utley
   described Jackson as "extremely important" and a "genius".^[437] At
   Jackson's memorial service on July 7, 2009, Motown founder Berry Gordy
   called Jackson "the greatest entertainer that ever lived".^[438]^[439]
   In a June 28, 2009 Baltimore Sun article, Jill Rosen wrote that
   Jackson's legacy influenced fields including sound, dance, fashion,
   music videos and celebrity.^[440]

   Jackson's meteoric rise in the 1980s catapulted him to global stardom,
   and his influence transcended borders. In Africa, his influence was
   compared to Nelson Mandela for his ability to inspire and unite diverse
   audiences through his music.^[441]^[442] Similarly, in India, Jackson
   was likened to Mahatma Gandhi, with his art championing themes of
   social justice and humanitarianism,^[443] and his influence extending
   to Bollywood where it was said that anyone who danced well was compared
   to Jackson.^[441] In Europe, Jackson's impact was compared to that of
   the Pope, drawing huge crowds of people who gathered to see the singer
   in public and even more to his concerts, which spread messages of love
   and healing during rough economic and political times.^[444] His
   presence in the Middle East was considered as widespread as Coca-Cola,
   symbolizing a shared global culture through his music.^[445]
   Additionally, Jackson is considered the backbone of the K-Pop industry
   in South Korea, influencing countless artists and shaping the genre's
   development.^[446]^[447]

   Craig Glenday, the Editor-in-Chief of Guinness World Records, called
   Jackson the most famous person in the world in 2006. Following
   Jackson's death, Glenday wrote in an obituary that Jackson had
   maintained this status up until his death,^[448] later remarking that
   his fame had exceeded that of Confucius.^[449] The Guardian wrote that
   he was in a league of his own in terms of fame, noting that Jackson had
   become so famous that the number of people who might not know who he
   was had become statistically insignificant.^[450] Due to his
   unprecedented influence, Jackson is recognized today as one of the most
   globally renowned figures in history. Reports of his fame extend from
   the Middle East,^[451]^[452] Africa,^[441]^[453] India,^[454]^[455] and
   China^[456]^[457] to tribes in the Amazon.^[458] His influence even
   reaches remote corners of the world such as São Tomé and Príncipe, or
   Tristan da Cunha, where tribute artists keep his legacy alive by
   celebrating his music. ^[459]^[460]

   In 2018, the National Portrait Gallery named Jackson the most depicted
   cultural figure of the century,^[461] later stating that Jackson's
   influence on art rivaled that of Jesus Christ.^[462] Nicholas Cullinan,
   director of the National Portrait Gallery and curator of the Michael
   Jackson: On the Wall exhibition, described Jackson's impact on art as
   unprecedented and claimed in 2018 that Jackson was the most depicted
   figure in the history of contemporary art.^[463] In 2014, a
   comprehensive study conducted by researcher Young-Ho Eom at the
   University of Toulouse identified Jackson as one of the most
   influential people of all time.^[464] The study utilized advanced
   ranking methods, including 2D Rank and PageRank algorithms, to analyze
   the impact of historical figures. Jackson was prominently placed on the
   list of top influencers, alongside Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus,
   Adolf Hitler, and Jesus Christ. An additional study conducted in 2013
   also identified Jackson as one of the most influential people of all
   time. This study ranked Jackson at the top of the list, alongside
   Napoleon Bonaparte, highlighting the extraordinary influence and global
   recognition that Jackson achieved throughout his career. ^[465]

Philanthropy and humanitarian work

   Main article: Philanthropy of Michael Jackson

   alcohol and drug abuse charities

   Jackson is widely regarded as having been a prolific philanthropist and
   humanitarian.^[466]^[467]^[468]^[469] Jackson's early charitable work
   has been described by The Chronicle of Philanthropy as having "paved
   the way for the current surge in celebrity philanthropy",^[470] and by
   the Los Angeles Times as having "set the standard for generosity for
   other entertainers".^[466]

   By some estimates, he donated over $500 million, not accounting for
   inflation, to various charities over the course of his life.^[466] In
   1992, Jackson established his Heal the World Foundation, to which he
   donated several million dollars in revenue from his Dangerous World
   Tour.^[471]

   Jackson's philanthropic activities went beyond just monetary donations.
   He also performed at benefit concerts, some of which he arranged. He
   gifted tickets for his regular concert performances to groups that
   assist underprivileged children. He visited sick children in hospitals
   around the world. He opened his own home for visits by underprivileged
   or sick children and provided special facilities and nurses if the
   children needed that level of care.^[citation needed]

   Jackson donated valuable, personal and professional paraphernalia for
   numerous charity auctions. He received various awards and accolades for
   his philanthropic work, including two bestowed by presidents of the
   United States. The vast breadth of Jackson's philanthropic work has
   earned recognition in the Guinness World Records.^[466]^[472]^[473]

   On May 14, 1984, President Ronald Reagan gave Jackson an award
   recognizing his support of alcohol and drug abuse charities,^[474] and
   in recognition of his support for the Ad Council's and the National
   Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Drunk Driving Prevention
   campaign. Jackson allowed the campaign to use "Beat It" for its public
   service announcements.^[475]

Artistry

Vocal style

   Jackson was known as an expressive vocalist with absolute
   pitch.^[476]^[477]^[478] Critics describe his vocal theatricality
   having a range from clear and soft to harsh and
   aggressive,^[479]^[480]^[481]^[482] depending on the genre sung.
   Principally in history, Jackson is the sole recipient to receive Grammy
   Awards for three different genres of vocal performance (as a soloist),
   winning Pop Vocal for "Thriller", Rock Vocal for "Beat It", and Rhythm
   and Blues Vocal with both "Billie Jean" and "Don't Stop 'Til You Get
   Enough". Bruce Swedien, his long-time sound engineer, emphasized that a
   critical element of their vocal recordings are of him and Jackson
   trying numerous approaches to rhythmic, emotional and technical
   distinctions to consummate a "sonic character".^[483] His stylings,
   such as common use of staccato, legato, falsetto as well as vocal
   hiccups,^[484] adlibs, wailings and growls are all signature to his
   sound.^[485]^[486]

   Jackson sang from childhood, and over time his voice and vocal style
   changed. Between 1971 and 1975, his voice descended from boy soprano to
   lyric tenor.^[487] He was known for his intonation and vocal
   range.^[428] Through each music release, his vocal development and
   changes were positively narrated by music journalists. With the arrival
   of Off the Wall in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities in his
   coming-of-age period had Rolling Stone comparing his vocals to the
   "breathless, dreamy stutter" of Stevie Wonder, and wrote that
   "Jackson's feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful. It
   slides smoothly into a startling falsetto that's used very
   daringly."^[488] By the time of 1982's Thriller, Rolling Stone wrote
   that Jackson was singing in a "fully adult voice" that was "tinged by
   sadness".^[489] The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the
   introspective album Dangerous. The New York Times noted that on some
   tracks, "he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops
   to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth" and he had a
   "wretched tone". When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the
   musician would return to "smooth" vocals.^[490] Of Invincible, Rolling
   Stone wrote that, at 43, Jackson still performed "exquisitely voiced
   rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies".^[491] Joseph Vogel notes
   Jackson's ability to use non-verbal sounds to express emotion.^[492]
   Neil McCormick wrote that Jackson's unorthodox singing style "was
   original and utterly distinctive".^[493]

Influences

   Jackson was influenced by musicians including James Brown, Little
   Richard, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene
   Kelly,^[494] and David Ruffin.^[495] Little Richard had a substantial
   influence on Jackson,^[496] but Brown was his greatest inspiration.
   When Jackson was a small child, his mother would wake him whenever
   Brown appeared on television. Jackson described being
   "mesmerized".^[497]

   Jackson's vocal technique was influenced by Diana Ross; his use of the
   oooh interjection from a young age was something Ross had used on many
   of her songs with the Supremes.^[498] She was a mother figure to him,
   and he often watched her rehearse.^[499] He said he had learned a lot
   from watching how she moved and sang, and that she had encouraged him
   to have confidence in himself.^[500]

   Choreographer David Winters, who met Jackson while choreographing the
   1971 Diana Ross TV special Diana!, said that Jackson watched the
   musical West Side Story almost every week, and it was his favorite
   film; he paid tribute to it in "Beat It" and the "Bad"
   video.^[501]^[502]^[503]

Musicianship

   Jackson had no formal music training and could not read or write music
   notation. He is credited for playing guitar, keyboard, and drums, but
   was not proficient in them.^[504] When composing, he recorded ideas by
   beatboxing and imitating instruments vocally.^[504] Describing the
   process, he said: "I'll just sing the bass part into the tape recorder.
   I'll take that bass lick and put the chords of the melody over the bass
   lick and that's what inspires the melody." These were shown in his
   demos for Beat It and Billie Jean where he vocalized the melody, bass
   instrumentals as well as lead and backing vocals by overlaying each
   component. The engineer Robert Hoffman recalled that after Jackson came
   in with a song he had written overnight, Jackson sang every note of
   every chord to a guitar player. Hoffman also remembered Jackson singing
   string arrangements part by part into a cassette recorder.^[504]

Dance

   Jackson danced from a young age as part of the Jackson 5,^[505] and
   incorporated dance extensively in his performances and music
   videos.^[505] According to Sanjoy Roy of The Guardian, Jackson would
   "flick and retract his limbs like switchblades, or snap out of a
   tornado spin into a perfectly poised toe-stand".^[505] The moonwalk,
   taught to him by Jeffrey Daniel,^[77] was Jackson's signature dance
   move and one of the most famous of the 20th century.^[506] Jackson is
   credited for coining the name "moonwalk" for this street dance move,
   previously known as the "backslide".^[507]^[508] His other moves
   included the robot,^[44]^[509] crotch grab, and the "anti-gravity" lean
   of the "Smooth Criminal" video.^[505]

Themes and genres

   Jackson explored genres including pop,^[4]^[510] soul,^[4]^[156] rhythm
   and blues,^[510] funk,^[511] rock,^[510]^[511] disco,^[512]
   post-disco,^[511] dance-pop^[513] and new jack swing.^[4] Steve Huey of
   AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the
   dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and
   ballads were softer and more soulful.^[4] Its tracks included the
   ballads "The Lady in My Life", "Human Nature", and "The Girl Is
   Mine",^[514]^[489]^[515] the funk pieces "Billie Jean" and "Wanna Be
   Startin' Somethin'",^[514]^[489] and the disco set "Baby Be Mine" and
   "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)".^[515]

   With Off the Wall, Jackson's "vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups,
   moans, and asides" vividly showed his maturation into an adult, Robert
   Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the
   Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a
   parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's "oddball" music personas:
   "Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage
   and in bed."^[516] With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone
   commented that Jackson developed his long association with the
   subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery.^[489] AllMusic's
   Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs "Billie Jean" and
   "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'".^[514] In "Billie Jean", Jackson depicts
   an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child,^[4] and in
   "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" he argues against gossip and the
   media.^[489] "Beat It" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side
   Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece,
   according to Huey.^[4]^[35] He observed that "Thriller" began Jackson's
   interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in
   subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem "We Are
   the World"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his
   lyrics and public persona.^[4]

   round ornament in its center. Jackson's Bad era jacket on display at
   the Hollywood Guinness World Records Museum

   In Bad, Jackson's concept of the predatory lover is seen on the rock
   song "Dirty Diana".^[517] The lead single "I Just Can't Stop Loving
   You" is a traditional love ballad, and "Man in the Mirror" is a ballad
   of confession and resolution. "Smooth Criminal" is an evocation of
   bloody assault, rape and likely murder.^[134] AllMusic's Stephen Thomas
   Erlewine states that Dangerous presents Jackson as a paradoxical
   person.^[518] The first half of the record is dedicated to new jack
   swing, including songs like "Jam" and "Remember the Time". It was the
   first Jackson album in which social ills became a primary theme; "Why
   You Wanna Trip on Me", for example, protests world hunger, AIDS,
   homelessness and drugs. Dangerous contains sexually charged songs such
   as "In the Closet". The title track continues the theme of the
   predatory lover and compulsive desire. The second half includes
   introspective, pop-gospel anthems such as "Will You Be There", "Heal
   the World" and "Keep the Faith".^[490] In the ballad "Gone Too Soon",
   Jackson gives tribute to Ryan White and the plight of those with
   AIDS.^[519]

   HIStory creates an atmosphere of paranoia.^[520] In the new jack
   swing-funk rock tracks "Scream" and "Tabloid Junkie", and the R&B
   ballad "You Are Not Alone", Jackson retaliates against the injustice
   and isolation he feels, and directs his anger at the media.^[521] In
   the introspective ballad "Stranger in Moscow", Jackson laments his
   "fall from grace"; "Earth Song", "Childhood", "Little Susie" and
   "Smile" are operatic pop songs.^[520]^[521] In "D.S.", Jackson attacks
   lawyer Thomas W. Sneddon Jr., who had prosecuted him in both child
   sexual abuse cases; he describes Sneddon as a white supremacist who
   wanted to "get my ass, dead or alive".^[522] Invincible includes urban
   soul tracks such as "Cry" and "The Lost Children", ballads such as
   "Speechless", "Break of Dawn", and "Butterflies", and mixes hip hop,
   pop, and R&B in "2000 Watts", "Heartbreaker" and

   World Tour in 1988

   Jackson released "Thriller", a 14-minute music video directed by John
   Landis, in 1983.^[525] The zombie-themed video "defined music videos
   and broke racial barriers" on MTV, which had launched two years
   earlier.^[38] Before Thriller, Jackson struggled to receive coverage on
   MTV, allegedly because he was African American.^[526] Pressure from CBS
   Records persuaded MTV to start showing "Billie Jean" and later "Beat
   It", which led to a lengthy partnership with Jackson, and helped other
   black music artists gain recognition.^[527] The popularity of his
   videos on MTV helped the relatively new channel's viewing figures, and
   MTV's focus shifted toward pop and R&B.^[527]^[528] His performance on
   Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever changed the scope of live stage
   shows, making it acceptable for artists to lip-sync to music video on
   stage.^[529] The choreography in Thriller has been copied in Indian
   films and prisons in the Philippines.^[530] Thriller marked an increase
   in scale for music videos, and was named the most successful music
   video ever by the Guinness World Records.^[223]

   In "Bad"'s 19-minute video—directed by Martin Scorsese—Jackson used
   sexual imagery and choreography, and touched his chest, torso and
   crotch. When asked by Winfrey in the 1993 interview about why he
   grabbed his crotch, he said it was spontaneously compelled by the
   music. Time magazine described the "Bad" video as "infamous". It
   featured Wesley Snipes; Jackson's later videos often featured famous
   cameo roles.^[531]^[532] For the "Smooth Criminal" video, Jackson
   experimented with leaning forward at a 45-degree angle, beyond the
   performer's center of gravity. To accomplish this live, Jackson and
   designers developed a special shoe to lock the performer's feet to the
   stage, allowing them to lean forward. They were granted U.S. patent
   5,255,452 for the device.^[533] The video for "Leave Me Alone" was not
   officially released in the US, but in 1989 was nominated for three
   Billboard Music Video Awards^[534] and won a Golden Lion Award for its
   special effects. It won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form.^[59]

   He received the MTV Video Vanguard Award in 1988; in 2001 the award was
   renamed in his honor.^[535] The "Black or White" video simultaneously
   premiered on November 14, 1991, in 27 countries with an estimated
   audience of 500 million people, the largest audience ever for a music
   video at the time.^[172] Along with Jackson, it featured Macaulay
   Culkin, Peggy Lipton, and George Wendt. It helped introduce morphing to
   music videos.^[536] It was controversial for scenes in which Jackson
   rubs his crotch, vandalizes cars, and throws a garbage can through a
   storefront. He apologized and removed the final scene of the
   video.^[160]

   "In the Closet" featured Naomi Campbell in a courtship dance with
   Jackson.^[537] "Remember the Time" was set in ancient Egypt, and
   featured Eddie Murphy, Iman, and Magic Johnson.^[538] The video for
   "Scream", directed by Mark Romanek and production designer Tom Foden,
   gained a record 11 MTV Video Music Award Nominations, and won "Best
   Dance Video", "Best Choreography", and "Best Art Direction".^[539] The
   song and its video are Jackson's response to being accused of child
   molestation in 1993.^[540] A year later, it won a Grammy for Best Music
   Video, Short Form. It has been reported as the most expensive music
   video ever made, at $7 million;^[541] Romanek has contradicted
   this.^[542] The "Earth Song" video was nominated for the 1997 Grammy
   for Best Music Video, Short Form.^[543]

   Michael Jackson's Ghosts, a short film written by Jackson and Stephen
   King and directed by Stan Winston, premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film
   Festival. At over 38 minutes long, it held the Guinness world record
   for the longest music video until 2013, when it was eclipsed by the
   video for the Pharrell Williams song "Happy".^[544] The 2001 video for
   "You Rock My World" lasts over 13 minutes, was directed by Paul Hunter,
   and features Chris Tucker and Marlon Brando.^[545] It won an NAACP
   Image Award for Outstanding Music Video in 2002.^[546]

   In December 2009, the Library of Congress selected "Thriller" as the
   only music video to be preserved in the National Film Registry, as a
   work of "enduring importance to American culture".^[547]^[548] Huey
   wrote that Jackson transformed the music video into an artform and a
   promotional tool through complex story lines, dance routines, special
   effects and famous cameos, while breaking down racial barriers.^[4]

   In 1988, Fisk University honored him with an Honorary Doctorate of

   from.^[574]

Earnings

   Main article: Estate of Michael Jackson

   In 1989, Jackson's annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and
   concerts were estimated at $125 million.^[223] Forbes placed Jackson's
   annual income at $35 million in 1996 and $20 million in 1997.^[575]
   Jackson has been one of the wealthiest celebrities and musical artists;
   estimates of Jackson's net worth during his life range from negative
   $285 million to positive $350 million for 2002, 2003 and
   2007.^[576]^[577] Forbes reported in August 2018 that Jackson's total
   career pretax earnings in life and death were $4.2 billion.^[578]^[579]
   Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an
   estimated $300 million in royalties. He may have earned another
   $400 million from concerts, music publishing (including his share of
   the Beatles catalog), endorsements, merchandising and music
   videos.^[580]

   In 2013, the executors of Jackson's estate filed a petition in the
   United States Tax Court as a result of a dispute with the Internal
   Revenue Service (IRS) over US federal estate taxes.^[581] The executors
   claimed that it was worth about $7 million, while the IRS that it was
   worth over $1.1 billion. In February 2014, the IRS reported that
   Jackson's estate owed $702 million; $505 million in taxes, and
   $197 million in penalties.^[582] A trial was held from February 6 to
   24, 2017.^[583] In 2021, the Tax Court issued a ruling in favor of the
   estate, ruling that the estate's total combined value of the estate was
   $111.5 million and that the value of Jackson's name and likeness was $4
   million (not the $61 million estimated by the IRS's outside expert
   witness).^[584]

   In 2016, Forbes estimated annual gross earnings by the Jackson Estate
   at $825 million, the largest ever recorded for a celebrity, mostly due
   to the sale of the Sony/ATV catalog.^[585] In 2018, the figure was
   $400 million.^[586] It was the eighth year since his death that
   Jackson's annual earnings were reported to be over $100 million, thus
   bringing Jackson's postmortem total to $2.4 billion.^[587] Forbes has
   consistently recognized Jackson as one of the top-earning dead
   celebrities since his death, and placed him at the top spot from 2013
   to 2023.^[588]^[589]

       that for a fact because I didn't talk to him about what he'd done.
       I couldn't. Witnesses do not discuss spiritual matters with a
       person who has disassociated himself from the Witnesses, including
       family members. But I want to stress that, contrary to published
       reports, I was not required to "shun" my son. Our relationship is
