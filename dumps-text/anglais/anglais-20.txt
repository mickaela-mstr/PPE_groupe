Tom Hardy's once-derided Kray Twins film Legend is having its day in the sun
on Netflix

   Guy Ritchie's 2015 biopic of the Kray twins, currently the most popular
   film on Netflix UK, does little to zhuzh up the crime genre — but it's
   elevated by one (two!) of Hardy's best performances

   Legend, now sat at the top spot on Netflix in the UK, famously wedged a
   two-star Guardian review between Tom Hardy's Kray twins on its
   promotional poster, cheekily disguised as if the critic's take was more
   favourable — with the two outer stars covered over. In ways, that sums
   up Guy Ritchie's gangster biopic: a showy, ostentatious,
   wannabe-prestige thing, clearly gunning for bonafides with all the
   trappings of awards bait, but without the formal ingenuity or pizzazz
   on the page to justify it. The saving grace? Hardy.

   Hardy plays two roles in one, sharing similar screen time and indeed,
   through some nifty effects work, often the same frame: both Ronnie and
   Reggie Kray, the nefarious sibling clubland duo who swindled and
   savoured '60s London in equal measure. They rubbed shoulders with the
   best and brightest in town, from Julie Garland through to Frank
   Sinatra, brutally extorting the local nightclubs while cultivating a
   chic, suited and booted image with the city elites.

   Legend isn't a good movie. Structurally, it's drab and conventional, an
   elliptical chronology of Kray moments loosely knitted together by the
   narration of Reggie's beleaguered beau, Frances (Emily Browning). It's
   shot and designed with all the colour of an old, faded postage stamp,
   functionally framed like a ‘70s soap, demonstrating little in the way
   of thought around visual language (for all of Ritchie’s pulpish
   strengths, he's never been great at placing a camera). So thank god for
   Hardy making it watchable.

   It's a two-hander for the most part, the genius of that being that the
   hands in play are both Hardy. But the Krays, despite their identical
   appearance, were far from the same person: Reg was the calm-headed
   leader of the pack, Ron more off-kilter and, as a paranoid
   schizophrenic, shown to be liable to flashes of violence. Reg speaks
   with a roguish twang, appears more chiselled and handsome, and
   certainly more approachable, a lad your nan might invite in for tea and
   cake. Ronnie variously communicates through his nose or with a bark,
   little between.

   The contrast Hardy captures between the two men is quite astounding,
   their smallest specificities — the sort you'd learn over time, months
   of orbit, to distinguish them — brought to the surface. Playing two
   parts of the same fraternity allows Hardy to showcase all of his
   emotional and physiological range. Ron is carried with weightiness, his
   chins gluttonous and pouring over like the gowls of a slobbering
   pitbull; Reg is commanding but light-stepped, svelte and debonair. The
   first presents that he will get shit done, in an escalate-to-deescalate
   fashion, whereas the latter actually does. It's the juxtaposition of
   power and control as projected by image.

   Despite popular misconception, Hardy and the infamous Krays aren't
   exactly from the same neck of the woods. The 44-year-old is clear about
   this in interviews, to be fair — in a Wired video, he described himself
   as a “bourgeois, posh, middle-class twat” — but Legend isn't simply a
   case of Hardy falling back into the working class rhythms of his youth.
   A lot of this is owed to roles like Bronson, Inception and Locke, where
   Hardy cultivated, consciously or not, a rough n' rugged, loveable bad
   boy image — Legend being the arguable apex.

   Seven years on, with Legend enjoying something of a resurgence
   vis-a-vis Netflix, you'd better believe there's only one reason people
   are flocking to rewatch it. And his name ain't Guy.

   Legend is now streaming on Netflix UK.
