The impact of urban legends
            Luna Infante, Assistant Opinion Editor
            October 31, 2023
            The impact of urban legends The impact of urban legends
            Jenna Taylor
            “Bloody Mary” repeated three times in the mirror, the tall,
            faceless man who lurks in the dark, the story of a man waking
            up with a missing kidney — urban legends have always been
            whispered to us. From a young age, we have been told stories
            about black-eyed children, the mysterious call received by a
            babysitter and hundreds of other stories that make our skin
            crawl. Urban legends surround us, and they can be anything
            from tales told on the school bus to internet stories. But why
            do stories like this spread, and why do they impact us so
            much?
            The term “urban legend” has been popular since the 1980s, when
            Jan Harold Brunvand published his collection of urban legends
            and their meanings. When discussing the story of the vanishing
            hitchhiker, Harold wrote that the legend had evolved from
            older European stories about travelers riding horseback. With
            time, the story adopted more variations. With changes in the
            narrative, scenery and characters, the story has traveled far
            and wide, spreading by word of mouth to ears all around.
            Urban legends typically grow popular through storytelling. The
            speaker usually claims that such things happened to “a friend
            of a friend,” making the story something we want to believe.
            Because why would a friend lie? The peculiarities and suspense
            of an urban legend are what makes them spread. The more
            shocking yet realistic the story, the more we want to share
            it. Sometimes, urban legends are told to extend caution and
            sometimes, most times, they are simply good stories. Nowadays,
            instant communication has made it easier for urban legends to
            spread. For a long time, urban legend email chains were
            popular, and now such tales are told on social media with a
            few clicks. The continuous pattern of misinformation
            circulating on social media has made it easier for such
            stories to be shared, as many people take what they read and
            hear on the internet at face value, never second-guessing
            their feeds.
            What makes urban legends so captivating is that they contain
            elements from everyday life, such as walking through the
            woods, driving down a long road, looking into a mirror — the
            list is endless. There is something so haunting about the
            possibility that ordinary things could expose us to the
            terrors these legends speak of. As time passes, urban legends
            shift, retelling a modernized version of the story to newer
            audiences, making urban legends everlasting.
            Some stories we take more seriously than others because apart
            from entertainment, urban legends allow us to spread awareness
            and preach caution about the dangers hidden in everyday life.
            But there have been times when urban legends have been taken
            too seriously.
            In 2014, two girls attempted to brutally murder their best
            friend because of the urban legend of the Slender Man. The
            first time the name touched screens was in 2009, when two
            faked photos and ominous captions were posted about the
            Slender Man, suggesting that because of this evil character,
            people had gone missing. These two simple posts sparked an
            internet phenomenon, birthing lore, video games, movies and
            more about the mysterious creature.
            People began to believe the Slender Man was real and that he
            was a danger to society, specifically children. In 2013, when
            the story reached 12-year-olds Anissa Weier and Morgan Geyser,
            it forever changed many lives. After believing that the
            Slender Man was going to harm her family, Geyser proposed to
            Weier that to become servants or proxies to Slender Man, they
            would have to sacrifice their close friend. After plotting,
            the two young girls lured their 12-year-old friend, Payton
            Leutner into the woods and stabbed her 19 times. Although the
            girls were caught and Leutner survived, the story is not any
            less terrifying.
            It is important to be cautious when spreading stories,
            especially among children. Because urban legends like this one
            can quickly unfold into more elaborate, creative stories, our
            minds can wander into dark, scary places. Although most are
            not susceptible to becoming violent because of a story, urban
            legends can trigger deep, dark fears, impacting us deeply and
            oftentimes making us paranoid.
            Most people have been impacted by urban legends in one way or
            another, whether that be hearing a story and sharing it with a
            friend or stumbling upon a Creepypasta and not being able to
            sleep in the dark for days. Urban legends are not typical
            scary stories; they are spread with the notion that they are
            true and that they are something we should beware of. Urban
            legends must be spread with warning, as they can unravel more
            than we know.
            Urban legends can form innocently, sometimes with the simple
            intention of amusing friends and sometimes with the intention
            of evoking harmless fear. But as humans, we have a knack for
            taking scary stories and legends too seriously. Do not believe
            everything you hear, and remember to spread stories with
            caution. You never know what you could be stirring up in
            someone’s mind or how easy it can be to impact a person’s life
            forever.
