   Pokémon^[a]^[b] is a Japanese media franchise consisting of video
   games, animated series and films, a trading card game, and other
   related media. The franchise takes place in a shared universe in which
   humans co-exist with creatures known as Pokémon, a large variety of
   species endowed with special powers. The franchise's primary target
   audience is children aged 5 to 12,^[2] but it is known to attract
   people of all ages.^[I]

   The franchise originated as a pair of role-playing games developed by
   Game Freak, from an original concept by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri.
   Released on the Game Boy on February 27, 1996, the games became sleeper
   hits and were followed by manga series, a trading card game, and anime
   series and films. From 1998 to 2000, Pokémon was exported to the rest
   of the world, creating an unprecedented global phenomenon dubbed
   "Pokémania". By 2002, the craze had ended, after which Pokémon became a
   fixture in popular culture, with new products being released to this
   day. In the summer of 2016, the franchise spawned a second craze with
   the release of Pokémon Go, an augmented reality game developed by
   Niantic. Pokémon has since been estimated to be the world's
   highest-grossing media franchise and one of the best-selling video game
   franchises.

   Pokémon has an uncommon ownership structure.^[11] Unlike most IPs,
   which are owned by one company, Pokémon is jointly owned by three:
   Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures.^[1] Game Freak develops the core
   series role-playing games, which are published by Nintendo exclusively
   for their consoles, while Creatures manages the trading card game and
   related merchandise, occasionally developing spin-off titles. The three
   companies established The Pokémon Company (TPC) in 1998 to manage the
   Pokémon property within Asia. The Pokémon anime series and films are
   co-owned by Shogakukan. Since 2009, The Pokémon Company International
   (TPCi), a subsidiary of TPC, has managed the franchise in all regions
   outside of Asia.^[12]^[13]

Name

   The original full name of the franchise is Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター,
   Poketto Monsutā), which has been commonly abbreviated to Pokemon (ポケモン)
   since its launch. When the franchise was released internationally, the
   short form of the title was used, with an acute accent (´) over the e
   to aid in pronunciation.^[14]

   Pokémon refers to both the franchise itself and the creatures within
   its fictional universe. As a noun, it is identical in both the singular
   and plural, as is every individual species name;^[15] it is
   grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well
   as "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu".^[16]

General concept

   Main article: Gameplay of Pokémon

   The Pokémon franchise is set in a world in which humans coexist with
   creatures known as Pokémon. Pokémon Red and Blue contain 151 Pokémon
   species, with new ones being added in subsequent games; as of January
   2024, 1,025 Pokémon species have been introduced.^[c] Most Pokémon are
   inspired by real-world animals or mythical creatures based on real-life
   folklore.^[17] For example, Pikachu are a yellow mouse-like
   species^[18] with lightning bolt-shaped tails^[19] that possess
   electrical abilities.^[20]

   The player character takes the role of a Pokémon Trainer. The Trainer
   has three primary goals: travel and explore the Pokémon world; discover
   and catch each Pokémon species in order to complete their Pokédex; and
   train a team of up to six Pokémon at a time and have them engage in
   Pokémon battles. Most Pokémon can be caught with spherical devices
   known as Poké Balls. Once the opposing Pokémon is sufficiently
   weakened, the Trainer throws the Poké Ball against the Pokémon, which
   is then transformed into a form of energy and transported into the
   device. Once the catch is successful, the Pokémon is tamed and is under
   the Trainer's command from then on. If the Poké Ball is thrown again,
   the Pokémon re-materializes into its original state. The Trainer's
   Pokémon can engage in battles against opposing Pokémon, including those
   in the wild or owned by other Trainers. Because the franchise is aimed
   at children, these battles are never presented as overtly violent and
   contain no blood or gore.^[II] Pokémon never die in battle – they faint
   upon being defeated, and can then be rejuvenated at a Pokémon
   Center.^[III]

   When a Pokémon wins a battle, it gains experience points.^[29] After
   gaining a certain amount of them, the Pokémon levels up, and its
   statistics rise. As its level increases, the Pokémon learns new
   offensive and defensive moves to use in battle.^[30]^[31] Furthermore,
   many species can undergo a form of spontaneous metamorphosis called
   Pokémon evolution, and transform into stronger forms.^[32] Most Pokémon
   will evolve at a certain level, while others evolve through different
   means, such as exposure to a certain item or trading with another
   trainer.^[33]

History

Origins

   The main idea behind Pokémon was conceived by Satoshi Tajiri. Tajiri
   was born on August 28, 1965,^[34] and grew up in Machida, a suburb of
   Tokyo.^[35] As a child, he enjoyed discovering and catching insects and
   other small creatures in the various ponds and fields that surrounded
   his town.^[36]^[37] During Japan's economic miracle, many cities,
   including Machida, were significantly expanded. As a consequence,
   Machida's nature was largely destroyed. In his second year of junior
   high school,^[38]^[39] an arcade hall opened in Tajiri's neighborhood,
   introducing him to video games. While studying electrical engineering
   at Tokyo College of Technology [ja], Tajiri began publishing a
   doujinshi magazine titled Game Freak. The title was inspired by the
   1932 film Freaks, which Tajiri was fascinated with at the time.^[40] He
   self-published the first issue of the magazine in March 1983, at the
   age of 17.^[41]^[42] At the time, magazines specializing in video games
   did not yet exist in Japan, allowing Game Freak to fill a gap in the
   market.^[43]^[44] Sometime later, Tajiri was contacted by aspiring
   manga artist Ken Sugimori, who became Game Freak's illustrator.^[45]
   Game Freak folded in the late 1980s,^[41] by which point Tajiri had
   become a respected game journalist in Japan's fledgling video game
   industry.^[46]

   Tajiri's knowledge of video games brought him into contact with
   Tsunekazu Ishihara. Ishihara had studied Arts and Science at Tsukuba
   University, and was trained in CGI. After working in advertising for
   two years, Ishihara joined a company named Sedic in 1983, which created
   video graphics and software,^[47] including one video game, Otocky
   (1987).^[48]^[49] As video games grew in popularity, Sedic also
   produced a number of game-related television shows for Fuji
   Television's late-night slot.^[47] In his job as a TV producer,
   Ishihara befriended Tajiri, as well as Shigesato Itoi, who would later
   become CEO of Ape, Inc.^[50]^[51] Ishihara was also the general
   director of the world's first gaming encyclopedia: TV Games:
   Encyclopedia of Video Games (テレビゲーム―電視遊戯大全, Terebigēmu ― Denshi Yūgi
   Taizen).^[52]^[53] Kenji Hatakeyama & Masakazu Kubo (2000) wrote that,
   at the time, Ishihara was probably the most well-connected man in the
   industry,^[54] with a knowledge of games "beyond comparison".^[55]
   Ishihara was also interested in playing cards,^[56]^[57] and
   contributed to the development of at least three simple card games
   designed by Itoi and published by Ape.^[d]

   In 1986, Tajiri, Sugimori, and a few other enthusiasts started an
   informal development team called Game Freak, named after the magazine
   it grew out of. Over the next few years, they independently developed
   the puzzle game Quinty, working on it alongside school or their regular
   jobs.^[64] However, no one within the group knew how to make the game's
   music. After consulting all his contacts, Tajiri got in touch with
   Junichi Masuda, who became the group's composer.^[65] Quinty was
   finished in 1989, and published by Namco.^[66] Tajiri officially
   incorporated Game Freak Co., Ltd. on April 26, 1989.^[67]

1989–1995: Development of Red & Green

   Further information: Pokémon Red and Blue § Development
   [220px-Duo_gameboy.JPG] Two original Game Boys connected with a Game
   Link Cable

   Tajiri started to think of what was to become Pokémon while completing
   Quinty, and before he officially founded Game Freak. Around this time,
   Nintendo announced the upcoming release of the Game Boy, a handheld
   console that would revolutionize the gaming industry. Tajiri learned
   that the device would have a link port, and with the corresponding Game
   Link Cable, two Game Boys could be linked together.^[68] Sometime
   later, Tajiri remembered an incident while playing Dragon Quest II
   (1987), a role-playing game (RPG) for the Famicom (NES). The game
   features randomly appearing items of varying rarity, including an
   extremely rare item called Mysterious Hat.^[e] Tajiri did not encounter
   any, while Ken Sugimori, who was also playing the game, encountered
   two. Upon recalling this experience, Tajiri realized that the cable now
   made it possible to transfer things from one cartridge to another.^[IV]
   He noted that, until then, the Game Link Cable was only used for
   competing, but not for something else.^[73] Combining this inspiration
   with his memories of catching insects and other small species, Tajiri's
   idea would eventually evolve into a virtual recreation of his boyhood
   experiences,^[74] and an attempt to "regain the world that he had
   lost".^[75] He would later state that the game represents "the story of
   a boy's summer day".^[76]
   [220px-Gachapon.jpg] Gashapon capsules have been cited as an
   inspiration for Pokemon.

   Tajiri and his Game Freak staff began pondering over a game centered on
   capturing creatures of differing rarity. Since the Game Boy is a
   portable device, these creatures could then be exchanged with other
   players in real life using the link cable. Once the player has caught a
   creature in-game, it was to be stored in miniaturized form in a special
   capsule. This facet of the game was inspired by Ultraseven, a tokusatsu
   show that Tajiri had enjoyed as a child.^[18] The series' titular
   character owns a number of capsules containing miniaturized kaiju
   (monsters), which come out and return to their original sizes when the
   capsule is thrown into mid-air. Kaiju media in general were an
   important influence on Pokemon, as many Game Freak staff members had
   grown up with them.^[70]^[77] Other influences that have been cited by
   Tajiri include: gashapon, capsules with toy figures in them that can be
   drawn from vending machines;^[78]^[79] collectible cards, such as
   baseball cards, Ultraman cards and menko;^[V] The Final Fantasy Legend
   (1989), the first RPG for the Game Boy;^[84] and petting in Japan, with
   Tajiri noting that having Pokemon is similar to having pets.^[85]
   Tajiri initially named his project Capsule Monsters, which GF's staff
   commonly shortened to Capumon.^[86] However, it later turned out that
   the term Capsule Monsters could not be trademarked, and it was
   subsequently decided to call the game Pocket Monsters, which became
   Pokemon. According to Tomisawa (2000), the phrase "Capsule Monsters"
   was already registered.^[86] According to Hatakeyama & Kubo (2000), the
   word "capsule" could not be used in the trademark.^[87] Tomisawa (2000)
   states that the Game Freak staff then came up with several
   alternatives, before someone within the team suggested "Pocket
   Monsters".^[86]

   In March 1989, Nintendo co-founded Ape, Inc. with Itoi. Ape's principal
   work was Mother (1989), a role-playing game written by Itoi, but it was
   also founded with the intent to give outside talent a chance to pitch
   new, innovative games.^[51]^[56] At the time, Ape was housed in the
   same Kanda-Sudachō office building as Nintendo, located in Tokyo.^[88]
   Ishihara, a friend of both Itoi and Tajiri, was involved with Ape's
   management (and would become its vice-president in 1991).^[51]^[54]
   Tajiri's relationship with Ishihara prompted Tajiri to present his idea
   for Pocket Monsters at Ape's office.^[89]^[90] Present during Tajiri's
   pitch was Takashi Kawaguchi, who worked at Nintendo's General Affairs
   Department and was also a manager at Ape.^[56]^[91] Kawaguchi brought
   the idea to Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi, who reportedly said:
   "This is it. This is the idea I've been waiting for."^[92] By pure
   coincidence, Ishihara had come up with an idea for a game similar to
   that of Tajiri, and around the same time was discussing it with Ape.
   This game, Toto, involved "using the Game Boy as an insect cage".
   Ishihara emphasized, however, that the idea of trading creatures with
   the link cable was Tajiri's. GF and Ape agreed to merge their projects
   together.^[93] According to Tajiri, the two teams initially
   collaborated on the game, but the work proved difficult, one of the
   reasons being that Ape was busy developing EarthBound.^[94]^[95] Tajiri
   eventually figured that "rather than working with Ape, we had to do
   something on our own, or the project would never get finished".^[94]
   Ape, Inc. is not credited on the final product.

   The development contract was signed at the beginning of 1990, with a
   planned delivery of the game in October.^[96] Tajiri directed the
   project, working under Ishihara.^[97] Ishihara was the producer – he
   managed the budget, staff, and work schedule, monitored the game's
   overall progress, and served as a liaison between Game Freak and
   Nintendo.^[93]^[98] Ishihara also contributed ideas to the
   development,^[57] and helped with debugging.^[99]^[100] Sugimori was in
   charge of the graphics and character design.^[101] Masuda created all
   music and sound effects, and did part of the programming.^[102] The
   budget that Nintendo granted to Game Freak was low;^[96] thus, Pocket
   Monsters was initially planned as a small, compact game, based
   primarily around Tajiri's core idea of exchanging.^[84]^[103] However,
   as development progressed, GF's ideas and ambitions for Pokemon
   grew.^[84] They soon realized that the game they were beginning to
   envision would not be easy to make. Sugimori admitted that, at the
   time, no one at GF had much knowledge of RPGs. "We thought we could
   handle it, but as we began working, we realized it was going to be
   tough", he acknowledged.^[104] Pocket Monsters was suspended
   indefinitely, and GF turned their focus on other titles (see Game Freak
   § Games).

   After the game's initial development phase in 1990 and 1991,^[105] the
   staff "tinkered with it from time to time", as Sugimori put it.^[106]
   For instance, by October 1992, a large number of Pokemon had been
   designed, and a poll was held that month among all staff members to
   gauge the popularity of the different species. Several more such votes
   followed to determine collectively which Pokemon should be
   included.^[107] Still, development had mostly come to a halt until the
   summer of 1994, after the release of the platform game Pulseman, upon
   which Tajiri decided it was time to make a serious effort towards
   finishing Pocket Monsters.^[108] By this point, Game Freak's experience
   had grown considerably. Over the years, a number of new staff members
   had been added to the company. One of them was Atsuko Nishida, a
   graphic artist who created Pikachu, among others.^[109]^[110]^[111]
   Ishihara used his knowledge of card games to add more depth to the
   battle system, and among other things suggested Pokemon types. Ishihara
   also came up with the idea of the Pokedex, a portable encyclopedic
   device which players can use to keep track of the Pokemon they
   caught.^[57] Throughout the years, Tajiri had several conversations
   with Shigeru Miyamoto,^[112] Nintendo's top game designer who Tajiri
   described as a mentor figure.^[18] Although, in a 2018 retrospect,
   Miyamoto downplayed his role in advising Tajiri, and stated that his
   contributions to Pokemon were in fact limited.^[113] Miyamoto did,
   however, suggest the use of different colored cartridges for the game,
   in response to Tajiri's and Ishihara's musings about making each
   playthrough slightly different, as to 'individualize' the player's
   experience.^[114] According to Tajiri, "five or seven colors" were
   considered,^[115] but they eventually settled on two: Red and Green.
   Otherwise identical, each had Pokemon not found in the other,
   encouraging players to socialize and trade to complete their
   collection.^[114]

   Ishihara aspired to create video games of his own.^[116] As Pocket
   Monsters Red and Green were nearing completion, Ishihara founded
   Creatures, Inc. on November 8, 1995. Upon founding, the company was
   housed in the same office building as Nintendo in Tokyo.^[117]
   Co-ownership of the Pokemon property, which Ishihara helped create, was
   subsequently assigned to Creatures. This resulted in Pokemon having
   three legal owners: Game Freak, the main developer; Creatures,
   representing producer Ishihara; and Nintendo, the publisher. Anne
   Allison (2006) wrote that Nintendo also bought the property after Red
   and Green were finished.^[118] Hatakeyama & Kubo (2000) noted that the
   ownership structure of Pokemon is uncommon.^[11] They wrote that
   "Pokemon is probably the only property in the world today for which the
   original rights are not concentrated in a single company", like The
   Walt Disney Company does with their IPs.^[119] Tajiri and Ishihara did
   consider merging Game Freak and Creatures at one point. However, Tajiri
   decided against it because he feared it would erase what he had built
   up since he was a teenager. "I felt threatened by the idea of changing
   how Game Freak was operating, and starting back over with Mr.
   Ishihara", he said. "It was an identity problem. If Game Freak ceased
   to exist, then so would I". Tajiri noted that, since Game Freak and
   Creatures both focus on Pokemon, it sometimes felt more like different
   departments than different companies.^[89]

   Pocket Monsters Red and Green were finally finished in December
   1995.^[120] A release date of December 21 that year was
   announced,^[121] but missed. After sufficient cartridges, manuals and
   packages had been manufactured, the pair of games ended up being
   published on February 27, 1996. However, the property was copyrighted
   in 1995, and "© 1995" is shown on the title screens^[122] and
   cartridges.^[123] This year is since used on the copyright notice^[1]
   seen on many Pokemon products, even though no actual Pokemon product
   was released in 1995.^[124]

1996–1998: Rise in Japan

Release of Red & Green

   Nintendo had no high expectations of Pocket Monsters Red and Green, and
   media largely ignored the game(s).^[125] By 1996, the seven-year-old
   Game Boy console was considered yesterday's news and near the end of
   its lifecycle.^[25]^[126]^[127] On the other hand, new Game Boys
   continued to be manufactured and sold.^[128] The console was widespread
   and, due to its age, affordable to children.^[25]^[129] Also, the Game
   Boy had experienced a small revival in Japan in 1995 due to the success
   of Mario's Picross. Coincidentally, this game was directed by Ishihara,
   and co-developed by Ape. The popularity of Mario's Picross incited
   Nintendo to develop the Game Boy Pocket,^[130] a slimmer and improved
   version of the Game Boy, released in Japan on July 21, 1996.^[131]
   Because of the timing and naming, some were under the impression that
   the Game Boy Pocket was made to promote Pocket Monsters, but this was
   in fact a coincidence that would end up benefiting both.^[132]

CoroCoro manga, Mew lottery

   Two media channels that would play important roles in the Pokemon
   franchise were the CoroCoro Comic, released monthly, and its sister
   magazine Bessatsu CoroCoro Comic, released bi-monthly. Both manga
   magazines are published by Shogakukan, a long-time business partner of
   Nintendo, and have featured manga based on Nintendo properties (e.g.
   Super Mario-kun, Kirby of the Stars, Donkey Kong). At the time of
   Pokemon's release, the main CoroCoro magazine was read by one in four
   elementary school students.^[133] CoroCoro's deputy editor-in-chief was
   Masakazu Kubo [ja]. On Ishihara's suggestion,^[134] Kubo commissioned
   the creation of a manga adaptation. Written and illustrated by Kosaku
   Anakubo [ja], its first chapter was featured in the March/April issue
   of Bessatsu CoroCoro Comic, released on February 28, 1996, the day
   after Red and Green's release.^[135] Shogakukan, which frequently
   surveys their target groups, determined that the Pocket Monsters manga
   was well received.^[136]

   To further promote Red and Green, the May issue of CoroCoro, released
   on April 15, 1996, announced the "Legendary Pokemon Offer", centered
   around a mysterious, secret Pokemon called Mew.^[137]^[138] Mew was a
   last-minute addition to Red & Green. It is unobtainable in the game(s)
   through usual means, and was intended to be used at a later point in
   some post-launch activity.^[139] To participate in the promotion,
   CoroCoro readers had to send in a postcard, and from the entrants, 20
   were selected at random. The winners then had to send in their
   cartridge so that Mew could be uploaded onto it. The lottery was a
   success and increased word-of-mouth.^[25]^[139] By September, sales of
   Red and Green had surpassed 1 million units.^[140]

Blue Version

   After the release of Pokemon Red and Green, Game Freak continued to
   grow, and a number of new employees were hired. For training purposes,
   they were ordered to study and make bug fixes to the source code of Red
   & Green, and to create new sprites for it;^[141] the test was later
   dubbed Pocket Monsters Blue. It was originally not meant to be sold.
   Only a small number of handmade copies were made, intended as a special
   gift to "20 to 100 people".^[142] After Kubo learned of it, he
   encouraged Tajiri and Ishihara to allow an official release of Blue.
   President Hiroshi Yamauchi initially rejected this, fearing it would
   confuse people into believing it was an entirely new Pokemon game.
   Kawaguchi then suggested an alternative, which Yamauchi agreed with:
   Blue would not receive a normal retail release, but would instead be
   made available only through mail order for a limited time as a special
   offer.^[143] It was announced in the November issue of CoroCoro, which
   explicitly stated that Blue was not a new game, but rather a special,
   limited edition to celebrate 1 million sales of Red and Green.^[138]
   The offer was a surprisingly big success: 300,000 units were expected
   to be sold, but over double was ordered.^[144]^[145]

Trading Card Game

   The Pokemon Trading Card Game was one of the first collectible card
   games (CCGs) developed in Japan. Its creation was influenced by Magic:
   The Gathering, the first CCG in history.^[146]^[147]^[148] Indeed, the
   Pokemon Trading Card Game can be considered a simplified version of
   Magic.^[149]^[150] First released in the United States in 1993, Magic
   had gained popularity not just in North America and Europe, but also in
   Asia.^[151] Ishihara was fond of playing cards,^[57] and had
   contributed to the development of at least three simple card games
   designed by Shigesato Itoi and released through Ape, Inc.^[d] At the
   time, Ishihara was particularly interested in Magic: The
   Gathering.^[146] While developing the Pokemon RPG, he realized that the
   concept behind it could be adapted into a Magic-like CCG.^[56] The
   Pokemon Trading Card Game was designed by Ishihara,^[152] Akihiko
   Miura, Kōichi Ōyama, and Takumi Akabane.^[153] All were former staff
   members of Ape and had previously worked on EarthBound (1994): Miura
   was the game's main designer, Ōyama was its art director, and Akabane
   was one of its chief debuggers.^[154]

   While card games have a long history in Japan, a collectible card game
   was a relatively new concept there, and at the time not widely
   known.^[155] Because of this, Ishihara had difficulties finding
   distributors. Sometime in 1995, Ishihara pitched the card game to
   Nintendo. They agreed to have the cards manufactured, subcontracting an
   unidentified printing company. However, Nintendo did not want the
   hassle of having to develop a distribution system from the ground up,
   i.e. finding retailers willing to sell a CCG.^[156] Ishihara was then
   contacted by Satoshi Kayama, director of a small firm called Media
   Factory. Like Ishihara, Kayama was a fan of card games. He felt that
   CCGs would soon rise to prominence in Japan, and had been gathering
   information on the possibility of developing such a game in some form.
   When Kayama heard that Creatures had developed a CCG, he contacted
   Ishihara and offered to distribute it, signing the contract near the
   end of 1995.^[157]

   CoroCoro again proved a valuable information channel. The Trading Card
   Game was first announced in the November issue, the same one that
   announced Pokemon Blue.^[158] The issue came bundled with two promo
   cards: one of Purin (Jigglypuff) and one of Pikachu. Surveys showed
   that they were respectively the most and second-most popular Pokemon at
   the time.^[159] On October 20, 1996, the first card set was
   released.^[160] Booster packs were launched the same day, containing 10
   randomly inserted cards.^[161] In the West, the booster packs contained
   11 cards.^[f] The original set would be titled the Base Set in English.
   Many more sets would follow. Despite being ignored by the media, except
   for the CoroCoro,^[162] the cards became an instant success upon
   release. 87 million Pokemon cards were shipped by the end of March
   1997, six months after its launch, and one month before the debut of
   the next big installment of the franchise: the Pokemon anime. The
   success of the TV series would cause the cards' sales figure to
   explode: by March 1998, a total of 499 million cards had been produced
   in Japan.^[163]

Anime production launches

   By August 1996, Kubo had become convinced of Pokemon's potential, and
   believed Shogakukan should create an anime adaptation.^[164] Nintendo
   was hesitant, noting that if the anime would flop, it would negatively
   affect the popularity of the game.^[165] Ishihara initially opposed the
   idea, because he thought it would overly hasten the 'consumption' of
   the property: he feared that if the series would end, people would
   assume that Pokemon has ended, and move on to the next thing.^[166] At
   the time, Creatures and Game Freak were planning the sequel(s) to Red
   and Green, Pokemon Gold and Silver, and Ishihara did not want the anime
   to end before they could release their new games.^[167]^[168] Kubo was
   ultimately able to resolve the concerns of all parties involved. An
   important aspect of Kubo's bargaining power was the then-ongoing Mini
   4WD craze and its accompanying hit series Bakusō Kyōdai Let's & Go!!.
   Kubo had an important role in the creation of both, which impressed the
   stakeholders.^[169] To appease Ishihara, Kubo promised him that the
   anime would last for at least a year and a half. This was unusually
   long for a debuting anime, and required a big investment.^[167]^[170]
   Kubo's proposal for Pocket Monsters was officially approved on
   September 26, 1996.^[171] For Nintendo of Japan, it was the first time
   they licensed a TV series.^[172] Kubo assigned independent producer
   Choji Yoshikawa [ja] to lead the project.^[173]

   Shogakukan Productions, commonly called ShoPro, was Shogakukan's
   production company. The animation company they commissioned was OLM,
   Inc. (Oriental Light and Magic), on Kubo's suggestion.^[174] Kunihiko
   Yuyama, one of OLM's founding members, became the anime's director.
   ShoPro assembled a team of five writers, plus two supporting
   writers.^[175] All key people involved with the production of Pokemon
   were well-experienced and had proven track records within Japan's anime
   industry. Yoshikawa felt that the team got lucky. "The probability of
   so many great people coming together at the same time is very low", he
   said.^[176] Per Tajiri's explicit condition,^[177] every anime team
   member had to play the game extensively, including the illustrators and
   voice actors.^[176] The anime staff "unanimously agreed that the game
   was interesting"^[178] and "felt connected with each other through the
   world of Pokemon",^[176] feeling positively challenged to make an anime
   that would match the game's quality.^[179]
   [220px-Liam_meets_pikachu_%2814438634188%29.jpg] A boy hugging a
   Pikachu-costumed performer. Pikachu became a popular character among
   both boys and girls.^[180]

   A production council was formed to produce the anime. Different people
   appeared at different meetings, but four individuals usually present
   were Ishihara of Creatures, Sugimori of Game Freak, Yuyama of OLM, and
   independent producer Yoshikawa. Yoshikawa had the final say. The
   council decided on the anime's worldview, characters, general
   storyline, and various important details. The early meetings, which
   were also attended by Tajiri, usually started with a Q&A session in
   which Tajiri and Ishihara were asked about the Pokemon universe.^[181]
   The council was careful to have the anime be in concordance with the
   video game. Inevitably, there had to be differences between the two,
   but all agreed that the overall worldview as envisioned by Tajiri
   should not be disturbed.^[182] At the start of the video game, the
   player has to choose one of three starter Pokemon: Fushigidane,
   Hitokage, or Zenigame (Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle). The council
   didn't want to unfairly popularize any of them, and wanted the
   protagonist to start out with a different Pokemon.^[183]^[184]
   Hatakeyama & Kubo (2000) wrote that, by coincidence, three people
   independently suggested to the council that a Pikachu should be a main
   character in the anime: Kubo, Yuyama, and Keisuke Iwata of TV Tokyo's
   Film Department.^[185] In the end, all council members agreed that
   Pikachu should be one of Pocket Monsters' central icons, as they
   expected Pikachu to appeal to both boys and girls, as well as their
   mothers. This would expand its audience, which was considered a core
   objective of the anime.^[186]^[187]

   During the council's first meeting, Yoshikawa brought up the issue on
   whether the Pokemon in the anime could talk, and if not, how they could
   communicate. In the video games, each has a specific cry. In Anakubo's
   CoroCoro manga, most could speak. At first, the council believed there
   should be a mixture of Pokemon that could talk and some that could not.
   However, this idea was eventually discarded: the Pokemon had to make a
   specific cry. The council agreed that Pokemon were like animals, and
   while they and humans should be able to understand each other in the
   series, they should not speak each other's language.^[188] It was
   decided that Pikachu would repeatedly say its own name in various
   intonations. The role of Pikachu was given to Ikue Otani. During
   try-outs, Yuyama had Otani voice Pikachu in normal Japanese, as well as
   in 'Pikachu talk', in which it only said the syllables of its name.
   Yuyama realized that, even in the latter style of limited
   communication, Otani was experienced enough to still convey the
   messages and emotions needed.^[189]

   ShoPro paid half of the production cost of Pokemon. TV Tokyo paid the
   other half and was granted co-ownership of the anime.^[190] The ads
   during the show's commercial breaks were managed by advertisement
   agency JR Kikaku [ja], which was in turn paid by sponsors buying
   advertisement space.^[191] In negotiating with TV Tokyo, Kubo managed
   to secure the 19:00 – 19:30 timeslot on Tuesdays.^[192] Pocket Monsters
   premiered on April 1, 1997. By November, it had become the
   highest-rated program on TV Tokyo.^[193] The anime succeeded in its
   goal of widening Pokemon's audience. Although the video games and the
   cards remained mostly of interest to boys, the anime also got more
   girls interested in the franchise, and girls' purchases of Pokemon
   products increased.^[180] This has been partly credited to Pikachu, who
   gained widespread popularity among both boys and girls.^[194] The
   success of this character would later lead to the game Pocket Monsters
   Pikachu (Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition), released in Japan on
   September 12, 1998.^[195]^[196] An adaptation of Pokemon Blue, this
   version was made to resemble the TV series more.^[197]

Copyright council formed, merchandising expands

   In the early months of the franchise, Nintendo was the contractual
   representative for Pokemon, and thus the central contact point for all
   Pokemon-related licensing (the approval of branded products).^[198]
   Around the time that planning of the anime begun, licensing requests
   for Pokemon started to increase, which Nintendo had difficulties
   handling due to a lack of (experienced) staff.^[199] Nintendo
   consequently granted ShoPro exclusive licensor rights. This was the
   first time that Nintendo of Japan (NoJ) granted licensor rights to
   another company, aside from its overseas subsidiaries Nintendo of
   America (NoA) and Nintendo of Europe (NoE).^[200]

   A copyright council was formed, headed by Ishihara. Beginning in April
   1997, the council met every Tuesday, in the conference room of
   Creatures' office, at the Nintendo Kanda Building in Sudachō,
   Tokyo.^[117]^[201]^[202] Attendees usually included Ishihara and his
   secretary, representatives of Nintendo, Game Freak, ShoPro, TV Tokyo,
   and JR Kikaku, as well as head of the anime Yoshikawa.^[203] Broadly
   put, every meeting had three types of agenda items: discussing
   Pokemon-related events and basic policies in Japan, discussing
   Shogakukan publication plans, and considering merchandise
   proposals.^[204] For merchandising, the council set the bar high.
   Fiercely protective of Pokemon's brand equity, Ishihara was unwilling
   to greenlit an item just because it had a picture of a Pokemon printed
   on it. To avoid the market being flooded with low-quality goods,
   Ishihara put very specific demands on the products he
   evaluated.^[167]^[205] Furthermore, in most cases, the council opted to
   contract one company for each product category.^[206] Because of this,
   most merchandise proposals were rejected: of the approximately 7,500
   applications submitted in 1997, only about 5% was approved.^[207]

   By March 1998, 35 companies offered licensed Pokemon goods, and there
   were approximately 700 Pokemon products.^[131]^[208] Tomy manufactured
   Pokemon toy figures and plush dolls.^[209] Bandai made Pokemon
   gashapon, dolls and ramune-flavored candy in a plastic box in the shape
   of a Game Boy.^[210] Meiji Seika produced Pokemon chocolate snacks and
   pudding.^[131]^[211] The lucrative franchise provided a much-needed
   boost to Japan's economy, which was stagnating in what would later be
   called the Lost Decade.^[212]^[213] An example of a firm that benefited
   greatly from Pokemon was food manufacturer Nagatanien [jp]. From May
   1997, the company began selling Pokemon-branded curry, furikake, and
   baking mixes.^[131]^[214] In December 1997, Nagatanien was hit hard by
   the collapse of one of its biggest sales channels, Toshoku, in what was
   then the third-largest bankruptcy in Japan's postwar
   history.^[215]^[216] Nonetheless, due to their Pokemon-licensed
   products, Nagatanien reported net profits in fiscal years '97 and '98,
   despite having forecasted losses.^[214]^[215]^[217]

"Dennō Senshi Porygon" incident

   See also: Pokémon episodes removed from rotation

   In the evening of December 16, 1997, the Pokemon franchise was hit by a
   crisis related to the broadcast of the anime's 38th episode, "Dennō
   Senshi Porygon" (Computer Warrior Porygon). It was watched by
   approximately 4.6 million households.^[218] In the episode, the cast is
   transported into a virtual world, accompanied by a Porygon, a digital,
   human-made Pokemon. While flying through cyberspace, they are attacked
   by an anti-virus program which mistakes them for viruses, shooting
   "vaccine missiles" at the group resulting in explosions of bright,
   rapidly swapping red and blue flashes.^[219]

   The intense stimuli brought about by the episode triggered a variety of
   adverse health effects in more than 10,000 viewers,^[220] primarily
   irritated eyes, headaches, dizziness, and nausea.^[221] A small part
   suffered a photosensitive epileptic seizure, manifested in loss of
   conscious and/or convulsions.^[221]^[222] Hundreds^[g] of children were
   brought to hospitals, although a part of them had recovered enough upon
   arrival and did not need to be hospitalized. No one died. Broadcasting
   of Pokemon was halted, and new guidelines were implemented to help
   prevent similar events from happening.^[228] With the show on hiatus,
   ShoPro and OLM worked on a feature Pokemon film. By the time the
   incident occurred, its script was already written, and the movie was in
   the storyboard stage. In mid-January, the staff resumed creating new
   episodes.^[229] The anime series returned on April 16, 1998.^[230] The
   film, titled Pocket Monsters the Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back (Pokémon:
   The First Movie), premiered on July 18, 1998 and became the fourth
   highest grossing film of the year in Japan.^[231]^[232]

   Ultimately, the incident did not damage the Pokemon franchise – it in
   fact grew further during and after the anime's hiatus. While video
   rental tapes were removed from shelves,^[233]^[234] all other Pokemon
   products continued to be sold as usual, and customer demand for them
   remained high.^[235]^[236] Helping matters was a general understanding
   among businesses that the anime was not canceled, but rather suspended,
   and many executives (correctly) expected the show to be resumed after
   precautions had been taken. Supermarkets and other distribution outlets
   responded calmly to the crisis, and did not remove Pokemon products
   from their sales floors.^[237]

1998–2000: International expansion

North America

     "When we started this project in Japan, one of the first things I
     was told was that this kind of thing would never appeal to American
     audiences. They said, 'Because the characters are in a very Japanese
     style, you cannot sell them to Americans'. So from the very
     beginning, I never thought there would be an English version. Now,
     it's just as popular in the United States [as in Japan], and I
     realized that we shouldn't always believe the opinions of
     conservative marketers."

   Shigeru Miyamoto, August 1999^[238]

   Possibly the first person to show interest in a North American launch
   of Pokemon was Minoru Arakawa, founder and then-president of Nintendo
   of America (NoA). Arakawa visited Japan to participate in Shoshinkai
   1996, held November 22–24. It was around this time when he first played
   one of the three Pokemon titles. He thought the games were promising,
   but Nintendo of Japan (NoJ) had no plans at the time to release them
   elsewhere. He returned to America with a few cartridges and tested the
   game on his employees – they did not believe it would work in the
   US.^[239] At the time, role-playing games (RPGs) were not very popular
   outside Japan,^[240] and NoA executives believed that American children
   did not have the attention span for such a complex title.^[241]
   Americans were said to be more interested in sport- and action-oriented
   games, preferably with realistic graphics.^[15]^[242] Japanese people,
   by contrast, were alleged to care more about characters and plot.^[243]
   Up to that point, few Japanese properties had been successfully
   mainstreamed in the US, and if they were, it was alleged to be on
   account of having been properly Americanized: Mighty Morphin Power
   Rangers was considered a prime example of this.^[244] Visually, Pokemon
   was believed to be too kawaii, or cute. It was assumed that Pokemon
   could not succeed on cute alone – it must also be cool.^[245]^[246] In
   an effort to enhance the franchise's coolness, NoA considered a
   graphical redesign and contracted a few external artists to create some
   test-designs for the American market.^[241]^[246] The mockups they
   proposed included 'graffiti style' drawings,^[246] 'beefed-up' and more
   muscular looking Pokemon,^[247] and a new Pikachu that looked like "a
   tiger with huge breasts".^[245] Arakawa concluded that it "didn't
   work",^[246] and by that time, the anime had begun its production in
   Japan, leading NoA to conclude it was too late for a graphical revamp
   anyway.^[241]

   Of pivotal importance to Pokemon's global expansion was Alfred R. Kahn,
   CEO of US-based 4Kids Entertainment, NoA's licensing agent since
   1987.^[248]^[249] Convinced of the franchise's potential, Kahn agreed
   to invest an undisclosed sum in return for both the anime and licensing
   rights.^[240] Pokemon became one of the first Japanese media franchises
   in which both the localization of the anime and the licensing of
   merchandise was handled by a single company, as well as a non-Japanese
   company.^[250] Kahn suggested to use the short version of the name,
   "Pokémon", adding an acute accent (´) over the e to assist with
   pronunciation and "give it a little flair".^[14] NoJ president Hiroshi
   Yamauchi officially approved the project in late November,^[251] and
   subsequently announced it at Space World 1997.^[252] However, three
   weeks later, the "Dennō Senshi Porygon" incident happened, which Kubo
   felt made even more people resistant to the idea of an overseas
   introduction.^[253]

   Market research turned back negative: American kids reportedly did not
   like Pokémon.^[254] Arakawa ignored the study and, convinced of the
   franchise's potential, allocated an enormous budget to Pokémon's
   launch. The exact amount was not disclosed, but was reportedly equal to
   or more than $50 million (c. $93.47 million in 2023), approximately the
   same amount as the launch budget of the Nintendo Entertainment System
   in 1985. Arakawa admitted that it was "quite a bit of money", but NoA
   "had been doing well for several years, so we had a lot of money to
   spare". He opined that if Pokémon would be as successful in the US as
   it had been in Japan, "an investment of 1 would turn into 100".^[255]
   NoA and 4Kids proceeded to devise a strategy on how to localize Pokémon
   for the United States.^[241] Arakawa appointed Gail Tilden to lead the
   project, prompting her to leave her position at Nintendo Power
   magazine.^[256] Tilden said that they "decided to make an all-out
   effort to repeat the phenomenon in the Western world".^[25] In two
   press releases, NoA self-described Pokémon's marketing campaign as
   "aggressive".^[257]^[258]

   The localization of the Pokémon anime was done by 4Kids, and directed
   by Norman J. Grossfeld. Grossfeld strongly believed that the anime
   should be Americanized.^[259] At NATPE 1998, he asked ShoPro for a
   "kind of carte blanche, to let me change the show as I think would work
   for this market", to which ShoPro agreed.^[260] However, no national TV
   station was interested in buying the anime or financing its
   localization.^[14]^[240] Kahn then decided to self-finance Pokémon's
   production costs, despite realizing this "could very well bring down
   4Kids" if the show would fail.^[260] According to Kahn, they "spend a
   fortune" on the localization.^[24] To have it broadcast in syndication,
   4Kids offered the show for free to local TV stations across the
   country, in exchange for a portion of the advertising
   revenue.^[14]^[240] NoA assisted, persuading dozens of stations to
   carry the series by offering to buy some of their advertisement space,
   spending a total of $5 million (c. $9.35 million in 2023).^[242]^[260]
   Despite all this, most broadcasters were still reluctant to carry
   Pokémon, with Grossfeld experiencing difficulties getting through their
   "preconceived notions or their snobbery for Western-produced animation
   over something from Asia".^[260] At the time, anime had not yet found
   mainstream popularity in the West. Contemporary news reports cited
   Sailor Moon^[VI] as an example of an anime that had failed to catch on
   with American youth.^[h] Still, with NoA's help, 4Kids ultimately
   succeeded in contracting 112 broadcasters for Pokémon,^[266] reaching
   "about 85 to 90 percent"^[267] of television households. However, many
   broadcasters gave it off-peak time slots, with starting times like
   06:00 or 06:30.^[14]^[242] Prior to the late 1990s, this was the case
   for many anime in the US.^[250]

   Grossfeld came up with the advertising slogan "Gotta catch 'em all!" as
   the English equivalent to the Japanese Pokemon GETTO daze~!
   (ポケモンゲットだぜー！, Get (the) Pokémon!).^[268]^[269] The phrase "miraculously
   managed to gain approval" by the Federal Communications Commission
   (FCC), which normally prohibits the use of injunctions in ads directed
   at children (e.g. "You must buy this!"). While the tagline does sound
   commanding, the FCC reasoned that the act of catching is at the core of
   Pokémon's play. Therefore, the phrase was allowed.^[270] The series'
   theme song was written by John Loeffler and John Siegler and performed
   by Jason Paige.^[271] In commissioning the track, Grossfeld
   specifically requested the song's chorus to be written around the
   "Gotta catch 'em all" phrase, firmly embedding the slogan into the
   theme.^[269]

   While NoA and 4Kids were allowed a fair degree of liberty in their
   localization of Pokémon, the Japanese copyright council, headed by
   Ishihara, had the last say over it. All decisions regarding adjustments
   and promotion had to gain final approval of the Japan side.^[272] This
   included all of the merchandise, for which a 'two-step system' was
   created. All (aspiring) licensees in North America were to send their
   merchandise proposals to 4Kids.^[240] Staff of both 4Kids and NoA then
   made a pre-selection and send the approved proposals to Japan, where
   the council made the final decision. Many submissions were bounced at
   the US stage, and thus never got sent to Japan. Tilden noted that
   processing all license applications, and mailing all approved
   prototypes and their documentation to Japan, was a lot of work. Arakawa
   did consider streamlining the process by moving someone from Japan to
   the US, but no person could be found who was as competent as
   Ishihara.^[273]

   The Pokémon anime was first broadcast on September 7, 1998.^[274]^[275]
   Pokémon Red Version and Blue Version were released three weeks later,
   on September 28, 1998.^[276] To localize the card game, Nintendo
   contracted Wizards of the Coast, the creator of Magic: The
   Gathering.^[277] The Pokémon Trading Card Game was officially launched
   nationwide on January 9, 1999, although pre-sold in select stores in
   December.^[278] Coinciding with the North American launch of Pokémon
   was the release of the Game Boy Color on 23 November 1998.^[279]

Other regions

   The American version of the Pokémon anime started broadcasting in
   Australia and New Zealand on September 28, 1998. Red and Blue were
   subsequently released there on October 23. Various territories in Asia
   followed: the anime series debuted in Hong Kong on November 16, in
   Taiwan on November 23, in Shanghai on November 24, in Beijing on
   January 10, 1999, and in South Korea on July 14, 1999.^[280]

   Outside North America, 4Kids distributed the anime in cooperation with
   Brian Lacey of Lacey Entertainment.^[281]^[282] The series was
   presented at MIP TV, in Cannes, France, from April 3–8, 1998.^[283]
   Broadcasters were initially not interested due to its Japanese origins,
   and preferred to wait and see how the anime would fare in the US. After
   its American success, Lacey received inquiries about the series
   throughout 1999 from multiple international broadcasters.^[281]^[284]
   Lacey noted that, in Europe, this was a stark contrast compared to
   previous years: "I was trying to sell this sort of stuff for years and
   buyers would tell me they were moving away from Japanese animation
   shows", he said.^[284] In October 1999, the franchise was launched in
   the European key markets of Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and
   Spain.^[285] The anime started broadcasting in Denmark, Norway, and
   Sweden in December 1999.^[284] In 2000, broadcasting rights for the
   first season were secured by TV stations in South Africa, Russia,
   Iceland, and Finland.^[286] In Israel, the anime debuted in February
   2000. For unclear reasons, Red and Blue were not officially released
   there. Thriving only on the strength of the TV series, The First Movie,
   the cards, and imported video games, the Israeli Pokémon still became a
   success.^[287]^[288]

   By the end of 2000, Pokémon games had been released in 70 countries,
   the anime was broadcast in 51 countries, the films were released in 33
   countries, and the cards had been translated into 11 languages.^[289]

1999–2000: Pokémania

   In North America, the debuting Pokémon franchise quickly rose to
   success. Red and Blue sold 200,000 copies in its first month. By
   December 1998, the Pokémon anime had become the highest-rated
   syndicated children's show during the weekdays.^[281] This attracted
   the attention of two media companies: Warner Bros., co-owner of The WB
   channel; and Saban Entertainment/Fox Family Worldwide, owners of the
   Fox Kids channel. A bidding war ensued between the parties, which was
   won by Warner Bros.^[290] On February 13, 1999, Pokémon launched on the
   Kids' WB national television block. The debut episode became the most
   watched premiere in Kids' WB's history.^[291] In European countries,
   the anime received similar levels of success. For example, in Germany,
   "a highly competitive kids market", Pokémon was purchased by RTL 2. The
   show's popularity bolstered the entire program block, more than
   tripling its viewers. Andrea Lang, RTL 2's editor of cartoons and
   children's programs, said: "We were speechless. We've never had a
   comparable success".^[284] By March 1998, half a year before Pokémon's
   overseas launch, 499 million Pokémon cards had been produced. By March
   1999, the total number of cards shipped reached 764 million. By March
   2000, this figure would grow further to 4.255 billion cards,
   manufactured in both Japanese and American factories.^[163]

   By April 1999, there was a general consensus in the US that Pokémon had
   become a phenomenon and the newest children's fad.^[VII] By some, the
   fad was referred to as "Pokémania",^[VIII] including journalists of
   Time^[25] and USA Today.^[299] In the US, severe scarcity occurred of
   Pokémon goods,^[23] especially Pokémon cards,^[300] causing companies
   to miss profits.^[301] A Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article, published
   on August 3, 1999, cited a Toys "R" Us manager as saying that a supply
   of 600 booster packs would last 24 hours. The CEO of one card
   distributor stated that they were "thousands of boxes behind" on
   orders. In the same article, a Wizards spokeswoman stated that more
   employees and printers had been hired to increase card
   production.^[302] However, near the end of the month, a different
   Wizards spokeswoman told The Washington Post that they had "exhausted
   most of the card-printing capacity of the United States".^[15]
   Similarly, USA Today reported in November 1999 that factories making
   Hasbro's Pokémon toys had expanded production by 20 times, but demand
   still exceeded supply.^[303] In Europe, scarcity of Pokémon merchandise
   also occurred.^[284]

   In part due to the Pokémon craze, Nintendo saw a 250% increase in
   profits in 1999 compared to the previous year,^[15] reaching a six-year
   high.^[304] The Pokémon franchise accounted for over 30% of Nintendo's
   revenue that year.^[305] Pokémon's popularity also caused a sharp
   increase in sales of the Game Boy line.^[241]^[306]^[307] The financial
   windfalls came at a time when Nintendo lost dominance in the home
   console market, with the Nintendo 64 being outsold by Sony's
   PlayStation.^[308]^[309]^[310] The global success of Pokémon
   compensated this loss somewhat.^[IX] Buckingham & Sefton-Green went
   even further, writing in 2004: "while Nintendo is now among Japan's
   most profitable corporations, it could be argued that the company would
   have struggled to survive without Pokémon".^[315]

   4Kids, initially a little-known firm,^[240]^[248] expanded thirty times
   in revenues,^[316] and was named the fastest-growing company in America
   in the September 4, 2000 issue of Fortune magazine.^[249]^[317]^[318]
   Many businesses that timely obtained a Pokémon license reaped
   considerable profits.^[316]^[319] In the summer of 1999, a massive run
   on stocks of publicly traded Pokémon licensees caused their value to
   increase dramatically. However, by November, most investors were
   shorting their shares. Realizing that Pokémon was a fad that would peak
   and fall at some point, investors were bearish about its
   prospects.^[320]

   Pokémon: The First Movie premiered in North America on November 12,
   1999, and in Europe the following year. Despite being negatively
   received by many Western critics, it became one of the most successful
   Japanese animated films of all time.^[321] In the United States,
   November 1999 was estimated to have been the peak of Pokémania.^[X]
   Supporting the American release of The First Movie was a promotional
   action with Burger King, one of the largest in the history of the
   fast-food industry.^[326]^[327]^[328] The success of the promotion
   resulted in supply issues; restaurants often ran out of Pokémon toys to
   include with their meals.^[329]^[330] On December 27,^[331] Burger King
   recalled its Poké Ball toy after a 13-month-old girl died suffocating
   on one.^[332]^[333]

   Pokémon Gold and Silver, the successors to Red/Green/Blue, were
   released in North America on October 15, 2000.^[334] In Europe, they
   were released on April 6, 2001.^[335]

The Pokémon Company and Pokémon USA established

   [350px-Mega_Tokyo_Pok%C3%A9mon_Center_wares_4.jpg] Pokémon Center Mega
   Tokyo, a large Pokémon merchandise shop in Sunshine City,
   Ikebukuro.^[336]

   On April 23, 1998, Pokémon Center Co. Ltd. was founded as a joint
   venture by Nintendo, Creatures, and Game Freak.^[337] It was initially
   formed for the management of specialized merchandise stores called
   Pokemon Centers, of which the first location opened in Nihonbashi,
   Tokyo, on July 18, 1998.^[338]^[339] Throughout the years, multiple
   Japanese Pokémon Centers would open and close. As of
   January 2024^[update], a total of 24 Pokémon merchandise shops exist in
   Japan.^[340] An American Pokémon Center also existed in New York City
   from 2001^[341] to 2005.^[342] It was then remodelled into Nintendo
   World,^[343] later renamed Nintendo New York.^[344]

   After the release of Gold and Silver, Tsunekazu Ishihara began setting
   out a number of long-term goals for the Pokémon franchise, which
   included releasing a movie every year.^[i] As part of Ishihara's plan,
   the Pokemon Center Co. Ltd. was reformatted into The Pokémon Company
   (TPC), and officially renamed in October 2000.^[338]^[345] The goal of
   TPC is to centralize and streamline the global management of
   Pokémon.^[346] Satoru Iwata, who had joined Nintendo of Japan in June,
   was involved with the company's creation, which was one of his first
   jobs at Nintendo.^[345]

   In February 2001, Pokémon USA (PUSA) was established, an affiliated
   firm of The Pokémon Company.^[338] The company's first president was
   Tatsumi Kimishima (who would later become president of NoA, and
   subsequently president of NoJ).^[347] In 2002, Kimishima was succeeded
   by Akira Chiba.^[348]

2001–2006: End of the craze, business reforms

   In North America, Pokémania peaked in 1999, slowing down throughout the
   next year.^[349] On April 29, 2000, the anime was bumped off Kids' WB's
   #1 spot after holding it for 54 weeks. Around the same time, Pokémon
   was surpassed at Fox Kids by its rival Digimon.^[350] In Europe, the
   craze peaked in 2000.^[351]^[352] On January 20, 2001, The New York
   Times reported that Pokémon's trading card market had collapsed in the
   US.^[353] A June 2001 survey in the United Kingdom confirmed that
   Pokémon's popularity was waning there.^[354] Tobin (2004) wrote: "By
   the summer of 2001, Pokémon's shelf space in Japanese and U.S. toy
   stores was but a fraction of what it enjoyed in the fall of
   1999".^[355] By the end of 2001, Pokémania was fading globally, and by
   2002, the fad was largely over.^[356]

   From 2000 to 2002, Game Freak developed Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, the
   successors to Gold and Silver, for the newly released Game Boy Advance.
   Masuda, who was appointed to assistant director during Gold and
   Silver,^[357] was promoted to director for Ruby and Sapphire, with
   Tajiri making himself executive director.^[358] Masuda was concerned
   that the end of Pokémania indicated the end of Pokémon as a whole:
   "After Gold and Silver came out, it was a huge hit around the world,
   but shortly after everyone was saying, 'That's it. The Pokémon fad is
   over! It's dead!'."^[359] Determined to keep the franchise going, GF
   not only wanted to "prove people wrong" with Ruby and Sapphire, but
   already started planning their sequels: Diamond and Pearl (2006). They
   also began planning remakes of older installments, starting with
   FireRed and LeafGreen (2004), remakes of the original Red and
   Green.^[359]

   Ruby and Sapphire were released in Japan on November 21, 2002, and in
   the rest of the world the next year. The games introduced 135 new
   Pokémon, bringing the total amount to 386. Because of this, Golin
   Harris, NoA's ad agency,^[241] advised them to move away from the
   "Gotta catch 'em all!" slogan. They reasoned that if new, younger
   players were drawn into the franchise with Ruby/Sapphire, they would
   find the concept of "catching them all" to be a daunting, if not,
   impossible task if they didn't also have Red/Blue/Yellow and
   Gold/Silver/Crystal.^[360] Dockery (2022) noted that "from both a
   marketing perspective and, really, a legal perspective, it would not be
   to the company's advantage to keep pushing that slogan".^[360]

   By 2002, the relationship between Pokémon USA (PUSA) and Wizards of the
   Coast had deteriorated. That year, at least seven high-profile
   employees were poached from Wizards by PUSA: Wizard's former art
   director, senior graphic designer, business manager, events marketing
   director, project management director, and two vice presidents. All
   employees had signed NDAs.^[361]^[362] In March 2003, PUSA told Wizards
   that their contract would not be renewed, and that Wizards would not be
   distributing the new Ruby & Sapphire card set.^[363] Later, Wizards was
   also prohibited from releasing the sets Jamboree and Legendary
   Collection II.^[364] Notably, Jamboree was the first set containing
   cards designed by Wizards themselves. As considerable time and money
   was invested into creating them, Wizards was upset when they were
   barred from putting them out. On October 1, 2003, the day after their
   agreement expired, Wizards filed suit against Pokémon USA, alleging
   that the defendant had seized their intellectual property and trade
   secrets, and illegally tried to gain advantage over them in the
   competitive trading card market.^[361]^[362] The case was settled out
   of court.^[365] Jamboree and Legendary Collection II have remained
   unreleased.^[362]

   In October 2001, 4Kids Entertainment signed a new contract with PUSA,
   continuing to serve as Pokémon's exclusive licensing agent and anime
   localizer.^[346] On December 23, 2005, it was announced that the
   agreement would not be renewed and would expire on December 31, with
   PUSA moving all licensing in-house.^[366]^[367] The localization of the
   anime would be done by PUSA in cooperation with TAJ Productions. PUSA
   proceeded to replace almost all of the original English voice actors,
   who were still under contract with 4Kids.^[368] This decision "raised
   the ire of fans and the actors themselves".^[369] According to Stuart
   Zagnit, who voiced Professor Oak, the recasting was done to cut back on
   costs.^[368]

   In March 2003, Pokémon UK was established in London as a British
   representative of The Pokémon Company.^[338]

2006–2012: Generation IV–V, TPCi established

   Following Ruby and Sapphire, Pokémon Diamond and Pearl were released
   for the Nintendo DS on September 28, 2006 in Japan^[370] and on April
   22, 2007 in North America.^[371] A third version, Pokémon Platinum, was
   released on September 28, 2008 in Japan^[372] and on March 22, 2009 in
   North America.^[373] They form the fourth generation (Generation IV) in
   the Pokémon video game series.^[374] Diamond and Pearl were designed
   based on the DS's various features such as its Wi-Fi capabilities and
   slot for Game Boy Advance cartridge.^[375] Pokémon president Tsunekazu
   Ishihara dubbed the games as the "ultimate" Pokémon titles because they
   allowed the player to trade and battle Pokémon including every Pokémon
   from previous iterations globally through WiFi, as opposed to
   previously only able to do so locally and with fewer Pokémon.^[376] The
   games' characters are 2D and the environments are rendered in 3D, and
   it is considerably difficult to differentiate them because Game Freak
   designed them this way to innovate the graphics while also retaining
   the traditional game style and feel.^[377]^[378]

   In Platinum, the developers focused on changing the most essential
   elements from Diamond and Pearl to maintain continuity with the
   previous games. Director Junichi Masuda stated that since they designed
   Diamond and Pearl as the "ultimate" Pokémon titles, it was only
   necessary to make Platinum "even stronger" than them. They approached
   this by designing the "Origin Forme" for the legendary Pokémon
   Giratina, ensuring that the design would appear significantly different
   from its regular form in Diamond and Pearl and to express the games'
   core antimatter and Distortion World concepts.^[379] The title Platinum
   was chosen to reflect a precious material that "shines" and is
   different from diamond and pearl and their associations of "love" and
   "happiness" respectively.^[380]

   Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver were released on September 12, 2009 in
   Japan and on March 14, 2010 in North America as part of Generation
   IV.^[381]^[382] They are remakes of Gold and Silver,^[383] aiming to
   balance familiarity for the original games' players and new content for
   newcomers.^[384] The titles reflected the theme of the bond between
   trainers and their Pokémon.^[384] The developers faithfully recreated
   the original story and added elements from the Generation IV games and
   Yellow, the latter of which was released concurrently with Gold and
   Silver.^[384]^[385]

   In 2009, Pokémon USA and Pokémon UK merged to form The Pokémon Company
   International (TPCi).^[12] This subsidiary of The Pokémon Company (TPC)
   has since managed the Pokémon franchise outside of Asia.^[13]

   In Generation V, Pokémon Black and White were released on September 18,
   2010 in Japan for the DS^[386] and on March 6, 2011 in North
   America.^[387] The games feature enhanced visual effects and increased
   use of 3D graphics. The developers excluded old Pokémon and strategies,
   while introducing over 150 new Pokémon to evoke a sense of novelty and
   to provide new players a more "leveled playing field" against old
   players.^[388] The games seek to attract both new players and returning
   players through its detailed walkthrough and the addition of C-Gear (a
   real-time communication tool to improve the trade and battle
   experiences), respectively.^[389]

   The games were followed by Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, which were
   released on June 23, 2012 in Japan^[390] and on October 7, 2012 in
   North America.^[391] The games were developed for the DS rather than
   the more powerful Nintendo 3DS to maintain continuity with the game
   world in Black and White and they were presented from a different
   perspective in the storyline.^[392] Since the games are their first
   sequels, director Masuda explained that they have strived to find a
   "fine balance" to appeal to both newcomers and returning players by
   implementing introductory explanations, and by placing a Pokémon Center
   in the first in-game city, they were able to further this approach by
   providing newcomers with a detailed walkthrough and also returning
   players with new updates.^[393] During development phase, director
   Takao Unno revealed that they had experimented with a 100-player
   multiplayer experience via their communication feature Entralink
   drawing from their vision of players "sharing the same space, same time
   and same game" but this feature was never implemented due to technical
   limitations.^[394]

2013–2018: 3D, Generation VI–VII, Pokémon Go

   In Generation VI, Pokémon X and Y were released worldwide for the 3DS
   on October 12, 2013,^[395] and they are the first games to be released
   in this way. The developers focused on the themes of "beauty", "bond",
   and "evolution", and it is based on these themes that they created the
   games' core mechanic where Pokémon could achieve a higher form of
   evolution by strengthening their bonds with trainers; however, to
   maintain game balance, they limited this feature to a special,
   temporary phenomenon.^[396] The games' shift to fully 3D graphics
   allowed the player to freely manipulate the camera angles although due
   to technical limitations objects far away are rendered in lower polygon
   models, and producer Hitoshi Yamagami addressed to 2D players that
   "Game Freak [developers are also] big fans of 2D graphics... So there
   are some elements in there that I [Yamagami] think fans of 2D will
   appreciate as well."^[397] When asked about the Horde battle and Sky
   battle types, he stated that Horde battles are to supplant the roles of
   "really strong pokemon [sic]" to help the player more easily progress
   through the games and also to add "more excitement to the battles and a
   sense of danger," and that they added the Sky battles to take advantage
   of the games' 3D camera angels capabilities.^[398]

   Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire were released worldwide for the
   3DS on November 21, 2014^[399] and on November 28, 2014 in Europe as
   part of Generation VI.^[400] They are remakes of Ruby and
   Sapphire.^[401] The developers adopted X and Y's core game mechanic and
   added enhanced 3D graphics.^[402] According to director Masuda, they
   reviewed the original mechanic and concept and expressed them using
   modern hardware, such as replacing the original PokéGear feature for
   the enhanced versions BuzzNav and DexNav to more effectively provide
   information enabled by the games' hardware capabilities. They seek to
   explore the concept of Pokémon coexisting with humans and nature,
   revisiting the concept behind original games' setting, which translated
   to "richness or abundance in nature and bonds between people and
   nature" in Japanese. To appeal to the newer audience in X and Y, the
   developers decided to connect the story with X and Y by further
   exploring their core mechanic.^[403]

   In Generation VII, Pokémon Sun and Moon were released worldwide for the
   3DS on November 18, 2016 and on November 23, 2016 in Europe.^[404] The
   developers chose Hawaii for inspiration due to its distinctive warm
   sunlight and clear moonlight and unique biomes that helped support the
   games' regional Pokémon variance concept. Ohmori said, as director, he
   aimed to focus on the concept of "Pokémon as these living creatures,
   [and really focus] on them being alive." Having the release date on the
   20th anniversary of Pokémon in mind, he treated this project as a
   "celebration of that life, and to really express this respect for
   life." As he contemplated about life and its origins, Ohmori considered
   the significance of the Sun, enabling life with its light, and the
   Moon's impact on certain species' reproduction. He explained how the
   Sun, the Moon, and the Earth "work [together] to influence [one
   another], and life as a result grows and flourishes based on [this]
   relationship."^[405]

   Ohmori stated that with the innovation to 3D in X and Y the designers
   decided to examine more minor aspects concerning with the Pokémon
   themselves such as their motions, such as when they designed the games'
   first starter Pokémon to capitalize on its owl-like characteristics
   with its head "twists round and round." With the 3DS technologies, the
   developers are able to design the characters to be more expressive as
   themselves including different facial expressions and reactions. In
   addition to portraying Pokémon harmoniously coexisting with people and
   vice versa in the games, the developers replaced the traditional Gym
   mechanic with Island Trials, deepening the players' connection with the
   story and their Pokémon.^[406] The enhanced versions Pokémon Ultra Sun
   and Ultra Moon were released worldwide on November 17, 2017.^[407] The
   games added an alternate storyline and additional characters, Pokémon,
   and other features.^[408] Developer Shigeki Morimoto revealed that they
   were developed by the younger staff members and veterans so the more
   veterans can prioritized on developing more important titles,^[409] and
   the developers considered them to be their culmination with the
   3DS.^[410]

Pokémon Go

   [220px-Pokemon_go_fest.jpg] Players during the Pokémon Go Fest in
   Chicago in 2017

   In 2016, the Pokémon franchise spawned a second worldwide fad with the
   release of Pokémon Go, a mobile augmented reality game. The app
   originated as a Google April Fools' Day joke in 2014: the "Google Maps
   Pokémon Challenge". The prank was conceived by Tsunekazu Ishihara and
   Satoru Iwata.^[411] On Ishihara's initiation,^[412] the hoax was turned
   into an actual video game developed by Niantic. Ishihara was a fan of
   Niantic's previous transreality game, Ingress, and saw the game's
   concept as a perfect match for Pokémon.^[412]

   Through in-game purchases, the game generated more than $160 million by
   the end of July 2016,^[413] with App Annie reporting that Pokémon Go
   had generated around $10 million in revenue every day that month.^[414]
   The same month, Sensor Tower reported that the game had passed more
   than $200 million in worldwide revenue, beating every existing record
   set by Clash of Clans and Candy Crush by a wide margin.^[415] The
   average daily usage of the app on Android devices in July 2016 exceeded
   that of Snapchat, Tinder, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook.^[416] By
   September 2, 2016, Pokémon Go had generated more than $440 million in
   worldwide revenue, according to Sensor Tower.^[417] By September 30, it
   had received 500 million downloads and grossed $470 million in 80 days,
   according to market research firm Newzoo.^[418] Pokémon Go reached the
   milestone of $600 million in revenue after only 90 days on the market,
   becoming the fastest mobile game ever to do so.^[419]

   Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! were released for the
   Nintendo Switch on November 16, 2018. They are part of Generation
   VII.^[420] Inspired by Pokémon Yellow, the games seek to introduce
   newcomers and a new generation of players (particularly Pokémon Go
   players) to the Pokémon series in addition to catering old players. As
   such, the games feature similar capture mechanics to Go where the
   player throws Poké Balls to catch wild Pokémon rather than battling
   them like traditional Pokémon games. In addition, the games feature the
   same setting and characters as the first generation of games and the
   original animated series, and include exclusively the original 151
   Pokémon to further appeal to their targeted audience.^[421]^[422] The
   only new Pokémon featured are Meltan and Melmetal.^[423]

2019–present: Generation VIII–IX, open-world gameplay

   Generation VIII^[424] debuted with the release of Pokémon Sword and
   Shield on November 15, 2019 for the Switch.^[425] Director Shigeru
   Ohmori stated that they designed the games based on what they believed
   of the biggest Pokémon theme of becoming/being "the greatest or
   strongest", which was expressed in the games' Dynamax / Gigantamax
   Pokémon core mechanic and the games' increasingly powerful software and
   hardware capabilities. Ohmori further revealed that through developing
   the Let's Go games as research projects for the Switch, they were able
   to gain valuable experiences and knowledge to develop Sword and Shield.
   He noted that they took advantage of the Switch's high resolution and
   TV connectivity to implement the games' gigantic-size core Pokémon
   mechanic. They envisioned the games' setting to be a "wide-open space"
   that is different from the traditional route systems and is constantly
   changing where the player can meet and explore with other
   players.^[426]

   Many pre-existing Pokémon are not available in Sword and Shield. This
   "Dexit", as it was called, led to fan backlash.^[427] Sword and Shield
   were the first Pokémon games to receive DLC expansions: Part 1—The Isle
   of Armor, and Part 2—The Crown Tundra; they were released on June 17,
   2020 and October 22, 2020 respectively.^[428] They include additional
   storylines, places, Pokémon, characters, and other features.^[429]

   In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. The resulting widespread
   ennui and excessive leisure time inspired a resurgence in popularity
   and interest of Pokémon cards,^[430] which was further popularized by
   various YouTubers and other influencers, such as Logan
   Paul.^[431]^[432] The craze resulted in severe supply shortages, and
   customers' inappropriate and obsessive behavior raised safety concerns
   in many retail outlets. Pokémon cards' values skyrocketed, prompting
   collectors to submit cards and overwhelm card grading
   agencies.^[433]^[434] The Pokémon Company responded by reprinting
   impacted products at maximum capacity to ensure price stabilization and
   general accessibility.^[435]

   Remakes of Diamond and Pearl, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining
   Pearl were released on November 19, 2021 for the Switch as part of
   Generation VIII.^[436] They are the first core series games to be
   developed by a third-party developer, ILCA, rather than Game
   Freak.^[437] The developers revealed that the games would not assume
   the anticipated style of the Let's Go Games and feature traditional
   game mechanics.^[438] Pokémon intends to celebrate their 25th
   anniversary with the release of the remakes by revisiting old games and
   mechanics, which they faithfully reproduced with enhanced 3D
   graphics.^[439]^[440]

   Pokémon Legends: Arceus was released on January 28, 2022 for the Switch
   as a prequel to Diamond and Pearl.^[441] It is part of Generation
   VIII.^[442] The game "represents a new approach for the Pokémon video
   game series" as it transitions from traditional RPG mechanics to add
   real-time elements in their games. Unlike traditional Pokémon games,
   the player can catch Pokémon by throwing a Poké Ball in real-time
   rather than triggering a battle; however, they can still choose the
   latter to weaken it for capture. Many in-game aspects, particularly its
   landscape, heavily resemble those of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the
   Wild.^[443]^[444]^[445]

   Generation IX^[446] was introduced with the release of Pokémon Scarlet
   and Violet for the Switch on November 18, 2022. The games are the first
   Pokémon games to feature an entirely open-world experience as opposed
   to the partially open-world experience in previous Pokémon games such
   as Sword and Shield, and it also departed from the traditional gym
   mechanics and the elite four battles to opt for unique road quests. The
   games' improved multiplayer experience allowed for up to four players
   to travel together.^[447]^[448] Their DLC, The Hidden Treasure of Area
   Zero, consists of two parts, The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk; The
   Teal Mask was released on September 12–13, 2023^[449] and The Indigo
   Disk was released on December 14, 2023.^[450] An epilogue to The Hidden
   Treasure of Area Zero was released on January 11, 2024.^[451]

   On 27 February 2024, TPCi announced Pokémon Legends: Z-A, set to
   release in 2025 for the Switch.^[452]^[453] It is part of Generation
   IX. A successor to Legends: Arceus, this game acts as a prequel to X
   and Y.

Media

Video games

   Main articles: Pokémon (video game series) and List of Pokémon video
   games

   Pokémon video games have been released in a wide variety of genres. The
   role-playing games (RPGs) developed by Game Freak are considered the
   core series of the franchise.^[454]^[455]^[456] Various spin-off games
   also exist, such as Pokémon Mystery Dungeon, a roguelike RPG series,
   Pokémon Ranger, an action RPG series, and Detective Pikachu (2018), an
   adventure game. Pokémon games, in particular the core RPGs, are
   commonly classified in generations. For example, Junichi Masuda
   referred to Diamond and Pearl (2006) as Gen 4,^[457] and X and Y (2013)
   as the 6th generation.^[458]

   Until 2011, Pokémon games were released exclusively on Nintendo's
   consoles. With the rise of the smartphone during the 2010s, The Pokémon
   Company also began developing, publishing, and licensing Pokémon titles
   for the mobile phone market, most notably Pokémon Go (2016), an
   augmented reality game developed by Niantic that spawned a worldwide
   craze in the summer of 2016.^[418]^[419]

   According to the official website of The Pokémon Company, as of
   March 2024^[update], over 480 million Pokémon game units have been sold
   worldwide.^[459]

   The Pokémon Trading Card Game (PTCG) was one of the first collectable
   card games (CCGs) in Japan. It was inspired by Magic: The
   Gathering.^[146]^[147]^[148] In the card game, the players use a
   60-card deck featuring Basic and evolved Pokémon, Energy cards, and
   Trainer cards to help them knock out the opponent's Pokémon, drawing
   prize cards and winning the game.^[460] Cards are classified into
   various levels of rarity, ranging from Common to Rare Holofoil with a
   holographic illustration. Rare cards, including limited edition,
   exclusive cards, and older cards, are highly valued among collectors
   due to their scarcity.^[461]^[462]

   According to the official website of The Pokémon Company, 64.8 billion
   cards have been produced as of March 2024^[update].^[459]

Anime

   Main articles: Pokémon (TV series) and List of Pokémon films

   As of 2025^[update], the anime consists of over 1,300 episodes across 8
   series in Asia, and 27 seasons internationally. Its newest series,
   Pokémon Horizons, started airing on 14 April 2023. The anime originally
   focused on Ash Ketchum and his travels across the Pokémon world with
   his partner, Pikachu. They were retired as protagonists after the 25th
   season,^[463] and Pokémon Horizons introduced two new protagonists,
   Liko and Roy.^[464] A total of 23 anime films have been released, the
   most recent being Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle
   (2021).^[465]

   Spin-off series from the anime have also been produced, including a
   variety show titled Weekly Pokémon Broadcasting Station (週刊ポケモン放送局,
   Shūkan Pokemon Hōsōkyoku), which aired on TV Tokyo from 2002 to 2004
   and aired in English as part of Pokémon Chronicles.^[466]^[467] Three
   television specials have been released. 27 short films staring Pikachu
   were produced, primarily preceding the films.^[468] Various animated
   mini-series also exist.

Live-action

   Detective Pikachu, a live-action/animated film based on the video game
   of the same name, was released in 2019.^[469] A sequel is currently
   under development.^[470]

   A live-action television drama produced by The Pokémon Company and TV
   Tokyo titled Pocket ni Boken o Tsumekonde premiered on TV Tokyo on
   October 20, 2023.^[471]

Postage stamps

   On June 17, 2024, La Poste (France) issued a booklet of 12 stamps
   dedicated to Pokémon.^[472]

Reaction to Pokémania (1999–2000)

   [235px-Pikachu_on_New_Yorker_cover%2C_Nov_1_1999.jpg] November 1, 1999

   overflowing with money while trick-or-treating. Artwork by Harry Bliss.

   In 1999 and 2000, Pokémon was an unprecedented, ubiquitous fad in the
   Western world. Time magazine described it as "a multimedia and
   interactive barrage like no other before it".^[25] The franchise,
   primarily aimed at children, elicited mixed responses from parents and
   teachers, some of them critical. Yano (2004) even claimed that the
   reactions at one point constituted a moral panic.^[473]

   The bulk of the criticism on Pokémon was directed at the trading
   cards,^[474] in particular the booster packs, sealed packages of 11^[f]
   randomly inserted cards that were sold separately from the main sets.
   The cards are of varying scarcity, the most valuable being the
   "holofoil cards" (also called "holographic" or "foil cards"), in which
   the illustrations of the Pokémon have a shiny overlay effect. The rare
   cards can only be found in booster packs, and the rarest ones are very
   infrequently included. Tobin (2004) notes that rarity in this case is
   "artificially created", and "effectively a form of gambling" in which
   children need to repeatedly purchase booster packs to get more rare
   cards.^[475] Brougère (2004) described a cynicism among adults that
   corporations could apparently, "out of thin air", ascribe value to
   cards which they saw as valueless, thereby "deceiving vulnerable young
   consumers and garnering excessive profits".^[474]

   As the franchise's popularity grew, children began taking their Pokémon
   cards to school for trading and playing. Soon, the cards were alleged
   to be "disrupting learning, poisoning playground friendships and
   causing such distraction that some children forget their homework, tune
   out in class and even miss school buses as they scramble to acquire one
   more card".^[476] The cards were "turning the playground into a black
   market",^[477] with card swaps sometimes inciting conflicts. Certain
   children engaged in "aggressive trading",^[478] tricking other (often
   younger) kids into unfair deals, forcing teachers to arbitrate.^[XI]
   Some parents expressed their concerns about the craze, but feared that
   their children would be ostracized if they were to deny them Pokémon
   products.^[478]^[483]^[484] In the US, the Pokémon cards ended up
   "almost universally banned" from school grounds.^[485] Similar bans
   occurred in Canada,^[486]^[487] Australia,^[488] New Zealand,^[489] and
   European countries.^[478]^[490]^[491] In September 1999, US-based law
   firm Milberg filed a class-action lawsuit against Nintendo of America,
   Wizards of the Coast, and 4Kids. The suit claimed that the booster
   packs constitute a form of lottery and promote gambling in
   kids.^[492]^[493] Susan Estrich noted that similar lawsuits had been
   filed against trading-card makers in the US, without success.^[494] The
   Pokémon card suit is not known to have gone to court, and is believed
   to have been settled.^[j]

   The Pokémon anime series was criticized by some as "cheap Japanese
   animation"^[496] that is "violent"^[26]^[497]^[498] and has "little
   educational value".^[499] Michelle Orecklin of Time dismissed the TV
   series as "less a cartoon than a half-hour exercise in Pokémon product
   placement".^[500] Allison (2006) wrote that even those within Pokémon's
   US marketing team agreed that the anime's visuals were "not especially
   sophisticated" compared to Disney cartoons.^[496] Pokémon: The First
   Movie premiered in the United States on November 12, 1999, and in
   European countries in February 2000. While a huge box-office success,
   the film was received negatively by several Western film
   critics.^[501]^[502] The Guardian decried it as a "contemptuously cheap
   animated cash-in on the monster kids' craze".^[503] The American adult
   animated series South Park satirized Pokémon in the episode
   "Chinpokomon", aired on November 3, 1999. In the episode, the titular
   media franchise is portrayed as a low-quality line of products that is
   part of an evil plan by the Japanese government to invade the US. South
   Park co-creator Matt Stone commented that, at the time, Pokémon was
   "scary huge".^[504]

   Kohler (2004) wrote that Pokémon was considered "ruthlessly
   commercial", and that it "program[med] children to be consumers of
   anything and everything Pokémon".^[505] CNN quoted child psychiatrist
   John Lochridge as worrying that "Pokémon's creators and marketers
   deliberately set out to create a fantasy world so compelling that
   children would quickly become obsessed". He believed that kids were
   being "brainwashed", and said: "I have had parents tell me that they
   cannot get their kids to do anything except Pokémon, so this stuff
   seems to really capture their minds, in a way".^[5] These concerns were
   countered by psychologist William Damon, who told Newsweek that
   obsessing is in fact a normal part of a child's neurological
   development. It should concern parents only when the obsession gets
   dangerous or excessive.^[506] An op-ed in the New Zealander newspaper
   The Dominion Post claimed that the anti-Pokémon sentiment was
   particularly American: "The backlash, which seems largely confined to
   the United States, may be no more than the sound of the world's leading
   cultural imperialist gagging on a taste of its own medicine".^[507]

   As Pokémania built, Western media started reporting on several crimes
   associated with Pokémon. These included violence^[488]^[508] (including
   two reported stabbings),^[509]^[510] burglaries,^[511]^[512]
   robberies^[508]^[513] (some at knifepoint),^[514]^[515] and
   shoplifting.^[516]^[517] Almost all these incidents were connected to
   the Pokémon cards, and the individuals involved were almost always
   underage. In the US, the incidents peaked in November 1999.^[322] In
   England, Pokémon-related delinquency reached a head in April
   2000.^[514]^[518] High prices on the grey market were a motive behind
   some of the crimes, "posing a great temptation for older kids and
   bullies to take advantage of weaker children".^[519] At specialty shops
   and online auctions, a rare Pokémon card could be bought and sold for
   $50 or more (c. $91 in 2023).^[520]

   Aside from the negative reactions, many media also cited alleged
   beneficial effects of Pokémon.^[521]^[522]^[523] It was noted that the
   video games and the cards require children to read, memorize,
   calculate, and plan out a strategy.^[4]^[163]^[524] Both encourage
   socialization, and trading Pokémon requires negotiating
   skills.^[5]^[15]^[21] Stephanie Strom wrote in The New York Times that
   the Pokémon anime taught children "traditional Japanese values --
   responsibility, empathy, cooperation, obedience, respect for elders,
   humility".^[525] Anne Allison interviewed various American parents
   during Pokémania. She found that while most of them were "utterly
   mystified" about Pokémon, few were overly worried about it, instead
   meeting the craze with "befuddled acceptance". Allison also notes that
   the Columbine High School massacre occurred during Pokémania (on April
   20, 1999), causing violent television, music, and games to be
   scrutinized. Compared to these media, she notes, Pokémon is in fact
   rather tame.^[526]

   In contrast, Pokémon received far less criticism in its native country
   of Japan. Yano (2004) attributes this to cultural differences, which
   includes: 1) greater acceptance of exuberant consumerism – to buy is to
   be a good citizen; 2) less focus on media influence – instead, Japan's
   educational system, bullying, and dysfunctional families are more often
   the target of attention; 3) less separation between child- and
   adulthood – what is suitable for adults is not necessarily considered
   unsuitable for kids; 4) Pokémon being permeated with kawaisa
   (cuteness), a hallmark of Japanese culture; 5) Japan's core religions,
   Buddhism and Shinto, are less moralizing in nature.^[527] However,
   Oliver Burkeman wrote in The Guardian that the Pokémon cards were also
   banned from some Japanese schools.^[28]

Legacy and influences

   See also: Cool Japan and Anime and manga fandom

   After World War II, Japan experienced a period of unprecedented growth
   and became well-known in the Western world for its consumer products,
   such as radios (e.g. Panasonic, Toshiba), cars (e.g. Toyota,
   Mitsubishi), and Sony's Walkman.^[528] From 1991 onwards, its economy
   stagnated, causing the country to lose its status as an economic
   superpower. However, during the 1990s and 2000s, Japan re-emerged as a
   source of 'cool' cultural goods, embraced by a growing international
   audience interested in Japanese culture.^[XII] Nintendo, Sega, and Sony
   launched several popular video game consoles and
   franchises.^[243]^[533]^[534] In terms of children's properties, the
   success of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers changed perceptions on the
   viability of such Japanese imports in the West.^[535]^[536]^[537] The
   Tamagotchi fad (1997–98),^[538] centered around a portable digital pet
   device, was said to have "paved the way for Pokémon".^[242]

   Anne Allison (2006) wrote that, before the 1990s, Japan figured little
   in the face of the worldwide hegemony of Euro-American cultural
   industries, in particular that of the US. "Hollywood has been hostile
   to imports", she wrote, "and foreignness has largely been, and been
   seen as, an impediment to mass popularization in the United
   States".^[539] The surprise success of Pokémon was "an undeniable
   breakthrough in the homeland of Disney" that "changed preexisting
   assumptions about the US marketplace at the same time that it was
   constantly resisted for deviating from them".^[540] Pokémon was a
   welcomed boon to Japan's faltering economy,^[212] and positively
   influenced the country's soft power.^[541]^[542] Kamo (2000)
   interviewed various American children and found that kids who thought
   Pokémon was cool, were more likely to believe that Japan was a cool
   nation.^[543] Allison (2003) gave a similar finding: all the children
   she interviewed knew where Pokémon originated, and "many said that, as
   a result of Pokémon and other 'cool' Japanese goods, they had developed
   an interest in Japan. A number said that they now wanted to study
   Japanese and travel there one day".^[544] Kohler (2004) wrote:
   "Japanese are proud of Pokémon, the most successful export of Japanese
   popular culture ever".^[545] Although, Iwabuchi (2004) questioned to
   what extent Pokémon really is 'Japanese', and to what extent it is
   simply a good property with universal appeal. He noted that Japanese
   nationalist commentators celebrated Pokémon's global success and
   retrospectively attributed this to its "Japanese cultural power",^[546]
   while ignoring the localization of Pokémon overseas,^[547] as well as
   decades of increasing cooperation and cultural exchange between
   countries (globalization).^[548]

   In the 20th century, anime found niche popularity in North America and
   Europe in series (Astro Boy, Kimba the White Lion, Speed Racer) and
   films (Akira, Ghost in the Shell).^[XIII] The Pokémon TV series and
   films marked a breakthrough for anime, contributing to its growing
   worldwide success at the turn of the 21st century.^[XIV] For some
   children, Pokémon was their introduction to 'Japanimation',^[553]^[554]
   serving as a "gateway" to other anime, manga, and Japanese culture in
   general.^[555]^[556] Pokémon: The First Movie became one of the most
   successful Japanese animated films in history.^[321] After Princess
   Mononoke, Pokémon: The First Movie became the second anime film to open
   at mainstream cinemas in the West, as opposed to the usual art house
   venues.^[557] Pioneering anime importer John Ledford noted that Pokémon
   underscored the commercial potential of anime, thus making it
   interesting from a business perspective.^[558]

   In the field of video games, the main Pokémon series became the
   standard within the monster-taming game genre, a subtype of RPGs. While
   not the first to use this concept, the Pokémon games became so
   synonymous with it that later titles involving catching and training
   monsters, of any genre, were inevitably compared to
   Pokémon.^[559]^[560]^[561] Examples of this include Dragon Warrior
   Monsters (1998),^[XV] Robopon Sun and Star (1998),^[567]^[568]
   Spectrobes (2007),^[XVI] Invizimals (2009),^[XVII] Monster Crown
   (2021),^[XVIII] and Palworld (2024).^[XIX]

   The success of Pokémon encouraged companies to look for other popular
   Japanese properties that might be localized for Western
   markets.^[250]^[589]^[590] The importing of at least three similar
   franchises were confirmed by business executives to have been (partly)
   inspired by Pokémon: Yu-Gi-Oh!,^[591] Digimon,^[592] and Monster
   Rancher.^[593] The import of Cardcaptor Sakura (as Cardcaptors) might
   also have been prompted by Pokémon.^[594]^[595]
