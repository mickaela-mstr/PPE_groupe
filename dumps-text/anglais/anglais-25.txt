Reviews

   “Plays out on one of the greatest, most beautiful maps in strategy
   gaming history. It combines style, substance, and setting into a
   marvelous overall experience for both empire management and tactical
   combat.”
   8.3/10 – IGN
   “BEST STRATEGY GAME 2014 - Reinvents the 4X genre, mirroring what XCOM
   did for tactical turn-based games, and they have, as today Endless
   Legend brings the genre to new heights.”
   9/10 – Hooked Gamers
   “COMMENDATION FOR DESIGN 2014 - At every stage Endless Legend shines.
   Where it takes from the past, it puts its own spin on it. Where it
   innovates, it does so cautiously and mostly successfully. Amplitude
   Studios has created another astounding story-driven game, that really
   has taken the best bits of RTS, RPG and 4X. This is a game that wannabe
   developers should play and learn from.”
   89% – PC Gamer

About This Game

Create your own Legend

   Another sunrise, another day of toil. Food must be grown, industries
   built, science and magic advanced, and wealth collected. Urgency drives
   these simple efforts, however, for your planet holds a history of
   unexplained apocalypse, and the winter you just survived was the worst
   on record. A fact that has also been true for the previous five.
   As you discover the lost secrets of your world and the mysteries of the
   legends and ruins that exist as much in reality as in rumor, you will
   come to see that you are not alone. Other peoples also struggle to
   survive, to grow, and perhaps even to conquer.
   You have a city, a loyal populace, and a few troops; your power and
   magic should be sufficient to keep them alive. But beyond that, nothing
   is certain… Where will you go, what will you find, and how will you
   react? Will your trail be one of roses, or of blood?
   [Story_Image_2.png?t=1728045983]

Explore fantastic lands.

     * Lead one of eight civilizations each with a unique gameplay style
       and storyline.
     * Survive through cold dark seasons that drive Auriga to its end.
       Will it also be yours?
     * Experience an endless replayability with randomly generated worlds
       and quests.
     * Set the size, shape, topography and more... to create your own
       world to discover.

   [Story_Image_3.png?t=1728045983]

Expand beyond the unknown.

     * Conquer, build and develop villages into feared fortresses or
       wonderful cities.
     * Assimilate powerful minor factions and use their special traits and
       units wisely.
     * Hire, equip and train your heroes to become army leaders or city
       governors.
     * Raise your civilization by finding mysterious artefacts and
       forgotten technologies.

   [Story_Image_4.png?t=1728045983]

Exploit every opportunity.

     * Evolve your civilization through the discovery of new advanced
       technologies.
     * Collect Dust, luxuries and strategic resources tradable on the
       marketplace.
