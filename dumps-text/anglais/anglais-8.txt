   What makes a scary movie extra creepy? We would argue it’s the specter
   of truth: that something bad or spooky can happen because we heard it
   happened for real somewhere. Enter: urban legends. Stories are passed
   down through generations—they always have been. And sometimes
   unexplained rumors of something that happened to someone somewhere can
   gain powerful momentum if enough folks keep those stories alive with
   new details and new audiences. Urban legends play on our biggest fears
   of the unknown: that something sinister could be lurking in a place or
   situation we otherwise feel safe in. But they’re also fantastic jumping
   off points for movies and more stories. We pulled together a list of
   some of the creepiest movies based on or surrounding urban legends—just
   in time for your Halloween watch party viewing pleasure!

1. The Ring

   The 2002 movie The Ring, inspired by the Japanese horror film Ringu
   (itself inspired by the 1991 novel Ring by Koji Suzuki) relies on the
   urban legend of a cursed videotape that, when watched, leads to the
   viewer’s death seven days later unless they can solve the mystery
   surrounding it. This concept of a cursed video or image leading to doom
   is linked to several urban legends, but one of the most prominent is
   the Japanese kuchisake-onna (Slit-Mouthed Woman) legend where a
   vengeful female spirit appears with a disfigured face and asks
   potential victims if they find her beautiful. Depending on their
   answer, she either kills them or harms them. The Ring urban legend
   plays on the broader concept of a jinx or cursed media, where engaging
   with specific content (like a tape, or photo) has a supernatural
   consequence. The idea of cursed objects or communication causing death
   has a long history in folklore worldwide, ranging from cursed paintings
   to cursed phone numbers. The cursed videotape in The Ring serves as a
   modern adaptation of these older legends.

2. Candyman

   Have you ever been at a sleepover and gathered with friends in the
   bathroom to chant “Bloody Mary” while staring into the mirror? …Just
   us? Well, the 1992 horror film Candyman is based on author Clive
   Barker’s short story The Forbidden, but it is heavily influenced by
   urban legends, particularly “Bloody Mary.” In this story, however, the
   ghost of a hook-handed man appears when someone says his name five
   times in front of a mirror. (It’s giving Beetlejuice.) This directly,
   ahem, mirrors the Bloody Mary game, in which a spirit is said to appear
   when her name is chanted multiple times while looking in a mirror. Both
   legends involve summoning a deadly supernatural entity through a
   ritual, usually a dare. Candyman also has another important element
   that often goes hand in hand with urban legends: the theme of racial
   violence and injustice. The backstory of the Candyman character is that
   he was a Black artist named Daniel Robitaille, who was brutally lynched
   in the late 19th century for having a romantic relationship with a
   white woman. He was tortured by having his hand cut off and replaced
   with a hook, and this racially charged backstory makes Candyman a
   complex blend of horror and commentary on the historical mistreatment
   of Black people. The setting of the film further digs into the often
   unfair and racially charged fears and anxieties of urban life,
   including poverty and crime.

3. I Know What You Did Last Summer

   Magazine

   Based on Lois Duncan’s 1973 novel of the same name, the 1997 slasher
   film, I Know What You Did Last Summer, is inspired by a famous urban
   legend. Often referred to as “The Hook” or “The Hookman” the legend
   features a hook-handed killer who stalks and attacks young couples,
   often parked in a secluded, “lover’s lane” area. A couple hears a news
   report on the radio about an escaped mental patient or killer with a
   hook for a hand. They become frightened and decide to leave the area,
   only to later discover a hook hanging from the car door, suggesting the
   killer was recently nearby. The story plays on fears of vulnerable
   teens being attacked in isolated locations.

   In I Know What You Did Last Summer, a group of teenagers accidentally
   hit a man with their car and, thinking he’s dead, dispose of the body.
   A year later, they begin receiving threatening messages from someone
   who says they know what they did and soon begin being stalked by a
   killer wielding a hook. The movie expands the original urban legend,
   but the origin is still there.

4. Slender Man

   Born from a modern urban legend that originated in the digital space
   (as opposed to urban legends that are passed down through stories over
   decades), the Slender Man was created in 2009 by Eric Knudsen (alias
   “Victor Surge”) on the online forum Something Awful. It quickly took on
   a life of its own and became an internet myth, gaining widespread
   influence as other users contributed additional stories, artwork, and
   videos to the character’s lore. Slender Man is typically depicted as a
   tall, thin figure with a featureless white face and tentacle-like
   appendages. He is often shown wearing a black suit, and he stalks,
   abducts, or influences children and teens, leading them into forests or
   causing them to act irrationally. The character’s lack of distinct
   features makes him especially unsettling, and he has become associated
   with psychological horror and the idea of losing control to a
   mysterious force.

   The 2018 movie Slender Man is about a group of teenage girls who summon
   the Slender Man through an online ritual and then find themselves
   haunted by him. The film taps into fears around the dangers of the
   internet, how myths and memes can spiral into something terrifying, and
   how they can influence vulnerable minds. In a tragic real-life twist,
   this urban legend was also tied to a real-life incident in 2014, when
   two 12-year-old girls in Wisconsin stabbed a classmate in an attempt to
   appease Slender Man, believing that they would become his proxies.
   While the film does not directly address the crime, the real-world
   implications of the Slender Man legend added an additional layer of
   creepiness to the character.

5. The Mothman Prophecies

   The 2002 film, based on John Keel’s 1975 book of the same name, The
   Mothman Prophecies was inspired by real-life events and an urban legend
   surrounding the mysterious creature known as the Mothman. The legend
   originates from sightings in the small town of Point Pleasant, West
   Virginia, during the mid-1960s. Keel’s book explores his investigations
   into the sightings and their possible connection to supernatural
   phenomena and tragic events. In 1966 gravediggers in Clendenin, West
   Virginia, claimed to have seen a large humanoid figure with wings
   flying overhead and two young couples reported seeing a man-sized
   creature with large wings and glowing red eyes who could fly at
   incredibly high speeds and follow their car as they fled the area. Over
   the next year, many residents of Point Pleasant reported sightings of
   the Mothman, and in some cases, witnesses experienced feelings of
   dread, anxiety, or paranormal events after encountering the creature.

   In 1967, the Silver Bridge, which connected Point Pleasant to Ohio over
   the Ohio River, suddenly collapsed, killing 46 people. The collapse was
   attributed to a structural failure, but many locals believed that the
   Mothman sightings were an omen predicting the disaster, and after it
   happened there were less reports of Mothman sightings. In the movie, a
   journalist, played by Richard Gere, investigates the strange sightings
   and prophetic warnings in a small town. Using the real-life reports and
   the Silver Bridge disaster as a backdrop, the film amplifies the eerie
   idea that the Mothman may be a supernatural being or entity that
   foreshadows catastrophe, weaving elements of mystery, paranoia, and the
   unexplained into the narrative.

6. Blair Witch Project

   This 1999 movie wasn’t based on an urban legend per se, but it used the
   idea of urban legends and folklore to scare viewers. Also? The
   filmmakers created and disseminated a fictional urban legend of their
   own—to promote the film, of course. Early internet culture helped to
   make their fictional legend seem real: the filmmakers created a website
   that presented the Blair Witch story as genuine folklore, complete with
   fake newspaper articles, journal entries, and “missing person” reports
   about the disappearance of the film’s protagonists. This viral
   marketing campaign, which blurred the line between reality and fiction
   (how quaint to imagine this in modern day!), smartly mimicked the way
   urban legends spread in the modern age, using the internet as a new
   medium for word-of-mouth. The legend in the movie was designed to feel
   like an authentic, ancient myth, and the film cleverly presents it as
   if it were real, using a “found footage” style to add to the illusion
   of authenticity. In it, three student filmmakers—Heather, Josh, and
   Mike—venture into the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland in 1994 to
   make a documentary about the Blair Witch legend.

   According to this fictional lore, which we see play out in The Blair
   Witch Project, the Blair Witch is a vengeful spirit tied to the town of
   Burkittsville (formerly called Blair). The legend spans centuries,
   beginning with the story of Elly Kedward, a woman accused of witchcraft
   in 1785 and banished to the woods after children accused her of luring
   them to her house to draw blood. Kedward was presumed to have died in
   the wilderness, but soon after her disappearance, the townspeople began
   to vanish, and the remaining villagers abandoned Blair, convinced that
   the area was cursed. The legend suggests that Kedward's spirit, known
   as the “Blair Witch,” haunted the woods around Burkittsville, causing
   mysterious disappearances and deaths over the years. The legend goes
   further, citing the abduction of a group of children in the 1940s by a
   man named Rustin Parr who killed them in his cabin,  claiming that the
   Blair Witch made him do it. All of this lore adds to the realness of
   this fake documentary-style movie, and it even fooled some audiences
   into believing that the legend really existed.

7. Urban Legend

   Finally, the 1998 horror film Urban Legend illustrates exactly why
   urban legends are excellent fodder for a scary movie. Set on a college
   campus, a series of gruesome student murders start happening–and they
   seem to reflect commonly known urban legends. Indeed, the killer in the
   film uses these legends as inspiration for creative killings, and the
   plot heavily relies on the audience recognizing these myths. Among the
   common urban legends depicted are the lover’s lane hookman (very I Know
   What You Did Last Summer), a killer hiding in the backseat waiting to
   strike, the call coming from inside the house, the Bloody Mary myth,
   pop rocks and soda combo death, flashing headlight gang initiations,
   kidney heist/organ theft, and more. The film helps perpetuate these
   urban legend fears, and that of course makes it easier to build a
   franchise of sequels! But one thing is made clear: urban legends will
   always be passed from generation to generation, and like story tropes,
   serve as endless inspiration for creators of thrilling content.
