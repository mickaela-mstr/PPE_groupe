Plot[]

   In the 1960s, Reggie Kray is a former boxer who has become an important
   part of the criminal underground in London. At the start of the film,
   his twin brother Ron is locked up in a psychiatric hospital for
   insanity and paranoid schizophrenia. Reggie uses threats to obtain the
   premature release of his brother, who is rapidly discharged from
   hospital. The two brothers unite their efforts to control a large part
   of London's criminal underworld. One of their first efforts is to
   muscle-in on the control of a local night club, using extortion and
   brutal violence.

   Reggie enters into a relationship with Frances, the sister of his
   driver, and they ultimately marry; however, he is imprisoned for a
   previous criminal conviction, which he cannot evade. While Reggie is in
   prison, Ron's mental problems and violence lead to severe setbacks at
   the nightclub. The club is almost forced to close after Ron scares away
   most of the customers. When Reggie is finally released from prison, the
   two brothers have an all-out fist fight on the first night after
   Reggie's release, but they manage to partially patch things up.

   The brothers are approached by Angelo Bruno of the Philadelphia crime
   family on behalf of Meyer Lansky and the American Mafia, to try to
   interest them in a crime syndicate deal. Bruno agrees to a fifty-fifty
   deal with Reggie to split London's underground gambling profits in
   exchange for local protection from the Kray brothers. Initially, this
   system is highly lucrative for the Kray brothers. However, the results
   of Ron's barely concealed violence continue to cause problems
   with Scotland Yard, who open a full investigation of the Kray brothers.

   Reggie beats and rapes Frances and she leaves him. Reggie then
   approaches her to start afresh offering her a holiday to Ibiza.
   However, she is soon found dead after committing suicide with an
   overdose of prescription drugs. The brothers' criminal activities
   continue, and they are unable to thwart the escalating Scotland Yard
   investigation by Detective Superintendent Leonard "Nipper" Read, who
   soon arrests Ron. The final scene shows a police squad breaking down
   the door to Reggie's flat in order to apprehend him.
   Krayslegend

   Tom Hardy as both Ronnie and Reggie.

   The closing captions indicate both brothers receiving criminal
   convictions for murder. They died five years apart, Ron from a heart
   attack in 1995, and Reggie from cancer in 2000.

Historical Inaccuracies[]

     * Albert Donoghue is already working for the Firm at the start of the
       film when Ron is in the mental hospital. However, in real life,
       Albert started working for them a few years after Ron's release.
     * The real life events which are depicted in the film happened
       throughout several years (from the late 1950s or early 1960s until
       1968). However, none of the characters age or start to appear older
       as the film goes on.
     * John Dickson and Pat Connolly do not have Scottish accents in the
       film, despite both in real life hailing from Scotland.
     * In the scene where Ron meets Frances for the first time, he tells
       her that he is homosexual. However, in real life, Ron claimed he
       was bisexual.
     * Charlie Richardson's arrest in July 1966 is shown onscreen before
       George Cornell's death, though this could be considered a
       flash-forward.
     * The film has a scene where George Cornell calls Ron a "fat poof" in
       a confrontation with the twins in E. Pellicci, but in real life,
       Ron claimed Cornell "never called [Ron] a poof in his life, because
       if he had done, [Ron] would have killed him then and there."
     * In real life, Ron claimed to have shot George Cornell because he
       threatened to kill him, as this made Ron decide to kill him first.
       In the film, however, Ron shoots Cornell for £2,000 from a dock
       worker who was beaten up by Cornell.
     * In real life, Ron claimed George Cornell did not say anything to
       him when he walked into The Blind Beggar and shot him. Also, the
       song 'The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore' was said to have been
       playing in the pub at the time of the shooting, but in the film, no
       music can be heard.
     * In the film, Reggie and Frances's eight-month marriage falls apart
       when he beats her up and rapes her. In real life, Frances insisted
       Reg was never physically violent towards her. Several friends of
       theirs have corroborated this. Helgeland has since said he used
       this scene as part of his "poetic licence."
     * The escape and murder of Frank Mitchell are not mentioned or
       depicted in the movie. This happened in December 1966, whereas the
       movie jumps from Reggie and Frances' relationship ending, occurring
       in 1966, to them both getting tickets to go to Ibiza in order to
       "make amends", occurring shortly before Frances' death in June
       1967.
     * Allegedly, during the morning after Frances' death, her brother
       Frank left a cup of tea for her in her room before he left go to
       work, unaware that she was dead. However, in the film, he is seen
       to have realised she was dead after entering her room.
     * Billy Exley drove Jack McVitie to Payne's house to kill him, but in
       the film, Jack appears to be alone. Payne also did not answer the
       door, nor did McVitie shoot him at all.
     * The murder of Jack McVitie happens differently in the film. Reggie
       suddenly decides to shoot Jack after he told Reg that it was "not
       [his] fault Frances killed herself" instead of already intending to
       do so due to him failing to kill Leslie Payne. He was lured into
       the basement and it was not done within the party. Also, Albert
       Donoghue and Teddy Smith were not present at the murder.
     * In real life, the Firm continued to operate for another seven
       months after, whereas the film seems to depict the arrest on 8 May
       1968, happening the morning after McVitie's murder.
     * Ronnie only occasionally wore glasses, not all the time as depicted
       in the film. Also, in the film, Ronnie's eyes are a blueish-gray
       colour instead of brown.
     * Throughout the film, there is no mention of Charlie Kray, the twins
       older brother, who was part of the Firm, and also a key influence
       on their lives, being present at and/or involved with many of the
       real-life events seen in the film.

   On 12 October 2013, it was announced that Brian Helgeland had written a
   script and would be directing a film focusing on the life of Reggie
   Kray who, with identical brother Ronald, formed the notorious Kray
   twins. Helgeland said the film would concentrate on Reggie's attempts
   to control the psychopathic tendencies of his younger twin.

   Helgeland spoke of hanging out in London with well-known Krays
   associate Freddie Foreman, saying, "I had drinks with him in his local
   haunt. When we finished he got up to go and they feted him at the bar.
   I said to him, 'what about the bill?' and he replied, 'we don't pay."
   Helgeland attended the Cannes Film Festival with Working Title's Tim
   Bevan and Chris Clark to talk to potential buyers of the film and
   showing test footage of Hardy playing the twins.

   female lead.
