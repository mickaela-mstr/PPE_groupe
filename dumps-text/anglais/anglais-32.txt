       buried in another place than her family.

       murdered anonymously while they slept in their bedroom.^[94]
     * The Snarly Yow is a folklore legend that describes a mysterious
       giant black dog, who has been sighted at various spots on West
       Virginia, Maryland and Virginia.^[95]
     * Snuff films (footage of actual murders and other depraved acts of
       cruelty being created for profit and/or personal entertainment)
       have been rumored for decades within the American film industry,
       with one of the first known films to be accused of the practice
       being the 1976 exploitation horror film Snuff.
     * El Sombrerón (also known as the Goblin and sometimes Tzipitio and
       Tzizimite) is a folklore legend that describes a legendary
       character and one of the most infamous legends of Central America.
     * The Spider Bite (or The Red Spot) is a modern urban legend that
       emerged in Europe during the 1970s. It features a young woman who
       is bitten on the cheek by a spider. The bite swells into a large
       boil and soon bursts open to reveal hundreds of tiny spiders
       escaping from her cheek.^[96]
     * The Spiteful Mermaid of Pyramid Lake is a man from the Paiute tribe
       claimed that he fell in love with a mermaid in the lake who cursed
       the lake in her vengeance.^[97]
     * Spook Hill is an urban legend that describes a gravity hill, an
       optical illusion in Lake Wales, Florida, where cars appear to roll
       up the spooky hill.
     * The Spooklight is a legend that is a ghost light reported to appear
       in a small area known locally as the "Devil's Promenade" in
       Missouri and Oklahoma.
     * Spring-heeled Jack is a British urban legend from the Victorian era
       involving the alleged sightings of a humanoid creature capable of
       leaping at great lengths and for reportedly assaulting several
       women in the streets of London. The first claimed sighting of
       Spring-heeled Jack was in 1837. Later sightings were reported all
       over the United Kingdom and were especially prevalent in suburban
       London, the Midlands and Scotland.
     * Stingy Jack is a legend from Irish folklore describing a mythical
       character who cheated the Devil and was cursed to roam the Earth
       for all eternity with a small ember burning inside a carved turnip
       as his only source of light. He is sometimes associated with the
       holiday Halloween while also acting as the mascot of the holiday,
       with his story possibly serving as the basis for the modern
       Jack-o'-Lantern.

T

   [edit]
     * Teke Teke (テケテケ) is the ghost of a young woman or schoolgirl who
       was tied to the railway line by bullies, which resulted in her body
       being cut in half by a train. She is an onryō, or a vengeful
       spirit, who lurks around urban areas and train stations at night.
       Since she no longer has lower extremities, she travels on either
       her hands or elbows, dragging her upper torso and making a
       scratching or "teke teke"-like sound. If she encounters a potential
       victim, she will chase them and slice them in half at the torso
       with a scythe or other weapon.^[98]
     * Teufelstritt (also known as the black kick, the devil's kick or the
       Devil's Footstep) is an imprint on the floor of the entrance hall
       of the Frauenkirche.
     * Tha Tian, where legend has it that two temple guardian giants
       clashed. The Giant of Wat Pho borrowed money from the Giant of Wat
       Jaeng (Temple of Dawn) and refused to pay it back. They fought
       fiercely in the midstream of the Chao Phraya River near Phra
       Nakhon. As a result of the battle, the around area was completely
       flattened, hence the name "Tha Tian", which means "flat pier".^[99]
     * El Trauco is a folklore legend that describes a repulsive
       dwarf-like creature with hypnotic powers that is known to prey on
       and impregnate unmarried women.

U

   [edit]
     * The Ultimate Warrior was an American professional wrestler whose
       death was the subject of numerous urban legends. Stories existed
       that he either tied his arm tassels too tightly and cut off the
       circulation to his body, overdosed on steroids or was killed in the
       ring while wrestling. Warrior eventually died in 2014 from a heart
       attack.^[100]

V

   [edit]
     * The Vanishing hitchhiker (or variations such as the ghostly
       hitchhiker, the disappearing hitchhiker, the phantom hitchhiker or
       simply the hitchhiker) story is an urban legend in which people
       traveling by vehicle meet with, or are accompanied by, a hitchhiker
       who subsequently vanishes without explanation, often from a moving
       vehicle. Vanishing hitchhikers have been reported for centuries and
       the story is found across the world with many variants. The
       popularity and endurance of the legend has helped it spread into
       popular culture.^[98]
     * The Vanishing Hotel Room a.k.a. Vanishing Lady: During an
       international exposition in Paris, a daughter leaves her mother in
       a hotel room; when she comes back her mother is gone and the hotel
       staff claims to have no knowledge of the missing woman. It is later
       revealed that the mother was dying of plague and, fearing for the
       negative impact on the hotel's public image, the staff just
       disposed of the mother, redecorated the room and pretended as if
       nothing had happened. This served as inspiration for the movie So
       Long at the Fair, and was based on a turn-of-the-century
       Philadelphia newspaper story.^[101]

W

   [edit]
     * Walking Sam (or Tall Man) is an urban legend that describes a
       7-foot-tall specter whose job it is to collect the souls of suicide
       victims and stalks lonely, depressed adolescents.^[102]
     * Walt Disney's Cryo Chamber is an urban legend claiming that after
       his death in December 1966, Walt's body (or in some versions just
       his head) was placed in a cryostasis chamber located somewhere
       beneath Disney World or Epcot.^[103]^[104]
     * The Water Babies of Massacre Rocks (originates from Idaho) are a
       Native American legend that are found in a couple of different
       places in America, but most famously in Pocatello at the Massacre
       Rocks State Park.^[105] They are said to be mischievous or
       malevolent baby- or dwarf-like creatures, with some tales placing
       their origins as drowned Native American babies during a famine.
     * The Well to Hell legend holds that a team of Russian engineers,
       purportedly led by an individual named "Mr. Azakov" in an unnamed
       place in Siberia, had drilled a hole that was 14.4 kilometres
       (8.9 mi) deep before breaking through to a cavity. Intrigued by
       this unexpected discovery, they lowered an extremely heat-tolerant
       microphone, along with other sensory equipment, into the well. The
       temperature deep within was 1,000 °C (1,832 °F) – heat from a
       chamber of fire from which (purportedly) the tormented screams of
       the damned could be heard.^[106]^[107]^[108]
     * The Duke of Wellington at Pau, France first appeared in a 1907
       publication coinciding with the 65th anniversary of the founding of
       the Pau Hunt, and quickly developed into a tale about the origins
       of Fox hunting in Béarn. After the Peninsular War, Wellington spent
       just one night at Pau, May 18, 1814, stopping on the route from
       Toulouse to Madrid. The tale of a more lengthy and marked presence
       developed 90 years later as a prank that regular winter colonists
       played on newcomers. The tale found its way into touristic
       marketing publications, memoires and academic publications during
       challenging times, and then, despite contradictory historical
       evidence, it has developed into Bearnese folklore. Worldwide, is
       difficult to find any 21st century historical passage about the
       19th century "English" colony at Pau that does not cite some form
       of this legend as fact.
     * The wendigo is a Native American folklore legend that describes a
       mythological creature or evil spirit which originates from the
       Algonquin culture based in and around the East Coast forests of
       Canada, the Great Plains region of the United States, and the Great
       Lakes region of the United States and Canada, grouped in modern
       ethnology as speakers of Algonquian-family languages.^[109]
     * White Things (or sometimes White Devils or Devil Dogs) is a
       fictional "bear ape" or "sheepsquatch" of the Kanawha River region
       of West Virginia.^[110]
     * The Women in Black of Wat Samian Nari is the story of the ghosts of
       the beautiful Thipsuksri sisters, Chulee and Sulee, in black
       dresses. The sisters are believed to have been crushed by a train
       until their bodies were torn in two in front of Wat Samian Nari
       temple, Chatuchak, Bangkok in the 1990s. Their spirits haunt people
       at night, especially taxi drivers. Most often it is said that a
       taxi picks up two sisters in black from the entertainment district,
       Ratchadapisek Road, or RCA past midnight. The sisters ask the
       driver to bring them to the Wat Samian Nari temple. Thinking they
       would go home after hanging out there, the driver notices that they
       sit quietly, not speaking to each other or even reciprocating with
       him. As the taxi approaches the destination, they mysteriously
       vanished from the back seat. The cab driver steps out of the car in
       a daze, suddenly seeing the two sisters lying on rail tracks in
       front of the temple, cut in half, and dragging their bloodied
       torsos in pain.^[111]

     * The Zombie Road (now called the Rock Hollow Trail) is an urban
       legend and abandoned gravel road located in the Al Foster Memorial
       Trailhead, Missouri.^[112]
