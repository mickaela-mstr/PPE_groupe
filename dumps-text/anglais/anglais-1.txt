   Urban legends (sometimes modern legend, urban myth, or simply legend)
   is a genre of folklore concerning stories about an unusual (usually
   scary) or humorous event that many people believe to be true but
   largely are not.^[1]

   These legends can be entertaining but often concern mysterious peril or
   troubling events, such as disappearances and strange objects or
   entities. Urban legends may confirm moral standards, reflect
   prejudices, or be a way to make sense of societal anxieties.^[2]

   In the past, urban legends were most often circulated orally, at
   gatherings and around the campfire for instance. Now, they can be
   spread by any media, including newspapers, mobile news apps, e-mail,
   and most often, social media. Some urban legends have passed through
   the years/decades with only minor changes, in where the time period
   takes place. Generic urban legends are often altered to suit regional
   variations, but the lesson or moral generally remains the same.

Origin and structure

   [edit]

   The term "urban legend", as used by folklorists, has appeared in print
   since at least 1968, when it was used by Richard Dorson.^[3] Jan Harold
   Brunvand, professor of English at the University of Utah, introduced
   the term to the general public in a series of popular books published
   beginning in 1981. Brunvand used his collection of legends, The
   Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends & Their Meanings (1981) to
   make two points: first, that legends and folklore do not occur
   exclusively in so-called primitive or traditional societies, and
   second, that one could learn much about urban and modern culture by
   studying such tales.^[4]

   Many urban legends are framed as complete stories with plot and
   characters. The compelling appeal of a typical urban legend is its
   elements of mystery, horror, fear, or humor. Often they serve as
   cautionary tales.^[5] Some urban legends are morality tales that depict
   someone acting in a disagreeable manner, only to wind up in trouble,
   hurt, or dead.^[6]

   Urban legends will often try to invoke a feeling of disgust in the
   reader which tends to make these stories more memorable and potent.
   Elements of shock value can be found in almost every form of urban
   legend and are partially what makes these tales so impactful.^[7] An
   urban legend may include elements of the supernatural or
   paranormal.^[8]

Propagation and belief

   [edit]

   As Jan Brunvand points out,^[9] antecedent legends including some of
   the motifs, themes and symbolism of the urtexts can readily be
   identified. Cases that may have been at least partially inspired by
   real events include "The Death Car" (traced by Richard Dorson to
   Michigan, United States);^[9] "the Solid Cement Cadillac"^[10] and the
   possible origin of "The Hook" in the 1946 series of Lovers' Lane
   murders in Texarkana, Texas, United States.^[11]^[12] The urban legend
   that Coca-Cola developed the drink Fanta to sell in Nazi Germany
   without public backlash originated as the actual tale of German Max
   Keith, who invented the drink and ran Coca-Cola's operations in Germany
   during World War II.^[13]
   [220px-Silverpilen_vid_kymlinge_sp%C3%B6kstation.png] An example of a
   supposed ghost train, the Silver Train of Stockholm, also known as
   Silverpilen (the Silver Arrow).

   The narrator of an urban legend may claim it happened to a friend (or
   to a friend of a friend), which serves to personalize, authenticate and
   enhance the power of the narrative^[14] while distancing the teller
   from the tall tale. Many urban legends depict horrific crimes,
   contaminated foods, or other situations that would potentially affect
   many people. Anyone believing such stories might feel compelled to warn
   loved ones. On occasion, news organizations, school officials and even
   police departments have issued warnings concerning the latest
   threat.^[15] According to the "Lights Out" rumor, street gang members
   would drive without headlights until a compassionate motorist responded
   with the traditional flashing of headlights, whereupon a prospective
   new gang member would have to murder the citizen as a requirement of
   initiation.^[16] A fax retelling this legend received at the Nassau
   County, Florida, fire department was forwarded to police, and from
   there to all city departments. The Minister of Defence for Canada was
   taken in by it also; he forwarded an urgent security warning to all
   Ontario Members of Parliament.^[16]

   Urban legends typically include common elements: the tale is retold on
   behalf of the original witness or participant; dire warnings are often
   given for those who might not heed the advice or lesson contained
   therein (a typical element of many e-mail phishing scams); and the tale
   is often touted as "something a friend told me", the friend being
   identified by first name only or not identified at all.^[17] Such
   legends seem to be believable and even provocative, as some readers are
   led in turn to pass them on, including on social media platforms that
   instantly reach millions worldwide.^[18] Many are essentially extended
   jokes, told as if they were true events.^[19]

   Persistent urban legends do often maintain a degree of plausibility, as
   in the story a serial killer deliberately hiding in the back seat of a
   car. Another such example since the 1970s has been the recurring rumor
   that the Procter & Gamble Company was associated with Satan-worshippers
   because of details within its 19th-century "57" trademark.^[20] The
   legend interrupted the company's business to the point that it stopped
   using the trademark.^[21]

Relation to mythology

   [edit]

   The earliest term by which these narratives were known, "urban belief
   tales", highlights what was then thought of as a key property: their
   tellers regarded the stories as true accounts, and the device of the
   FOAF (acronym for "Friend of a Friend" invented by English writer and
   folklorist Rodney Dale in 1976) was a spurious but significant effort
   at authentication.^[22] The coinage leads in turn to the terms
   "FOAFlore" and "FOAFtale". While at least one classic legend, the
   "Death Car", has been shown to have some basis in fact,^[23]
   folklorists have an interest in debunking those narratives only to the
   degree that establishing non-factuality warrants the assumption that
   there must be some other reason why the tales are told, re-told and
   believed.^[24] As in the case of myth, the narratives are believed
   because they construct and reinforce the worldview of the group within
   which they are told, or "because they provide us with coherent and
   convincing explanations of complex events".^[25]

   Social scientists have started to draw on urban legends in order to
   help explain complex socio-psychological beliefs, such as attitudes to
   crime, childcare, fast food, SUVs and other "family" choices.^[26] The
   authors make an explicit connection between urban legends and popular
   folklore, such as Grimm's Fairy Tales, where similar themes and motifs
   arise. For that reason, it is characteristic of groups within which a
   given narrative circulates to vehemently reject claims or
   demonstrations of non-factuality; an example would be the expressions
   of outrage by police officers who are told that adulteration of
   Halloween treats by strangers (the subject of periodic moral panics)
   occurs extremely rarely, if at all.^[24]^[27]

Documentation

   [edit]

   The Internet has made it easier both to spread and to debunk urban
   legends.^[28]^[29] For instance, the Usenet newsgroup
   alt.folklore.urban and several other websites, most notably snopes.com,
   focus on discussing, tracking, and analyzing urban legends. The United
   States Department of Energy had a now-discontinued service called
   Hoaxbusters^[30] that dealt with computer-distributed hoaxes and
   legends.^[31] The most notable such hoaxes are known as creepypastas,
   which are typically horror stories written anonymously. Although most
   are regarded as obviously false, some, such as the Slender Man, have
   gained a following of people that do believe in them.^[32]

   Television shows such as Urban Legends, Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction,
   and later Mostly True Stories: Urban Legends Revealed, feature
   re-enactments of urban legends, detailing the accounts of the tales and
   (typically later in an episode) revealing any factual basis they may
   have. The Discovery Channel TV show MythBusters (2003–2016) tried to
   prove or disprove several urban legends by attempting to reproduce them
   using the scientific method. ^[33]

   The 1998 film Urban Legend featured students discussing popular urban
   legends while at the same time falling victim to killings re-enacting
   them.^[34] The 1999 film The Blair Witch Project purposefully
   positioned itself as an urban legend to gain viral hype and succeeded
   in fooling many that it was based on a real disappearance.^[35] The
   lack of widespread social media and search engines helped it
   proliferate in the months leading up to its release.^[36]

   Between 1992 and 1998 The Guardian newspaper "Weekend" section
   published the illustrated "Urban Myths" column by Phil Healey and Rick
   Glanvill, with content taken from a series of four books: Urban Myths,
   The Return of Urban Myths, Urban Myths Unplugged,^[37] and Now! That's
   What I Call Urban Myths. The 1994 comics anthology the Big Book of
   Urban Legends, written by Robert Boyd, Jan Harold Brunvand, and Robert
   Loren Fleming, featured 200 urban legends, displayed as
   comics.^[citation needed]

   The British writer Tony Barrell has explored urban legends in a
   long-running column in The Sunday Times. These include the story that
   Orson Welles began work on a Batman movie in the 1940s, which was to
   feature James Cagney as the Riddler and Marlene Dietrich as
   Catwoman;^[38] the persistent rumour that the rock singer Courtney Love
   is the granddaughter of Marlon Brando;^[39] and the idea that a famous
   1970s poster of Farrah Fawcett contains a subliminal sexual message
   concealed in the actress's hair.^[40]

Genres

   [edit]

Crime

   [edit]

   As with traditional urban legends, many internet rumors are about
   crimes or crime waves – either fictional or based on real events that
   have been largely exaggerated.^[41]^[42]^[43] Such stories can be
   problematic, both because they purport to be relevant modern news and
   because they do not follow the typical patterns of urban legends.^[44]

Medicine

   [edit]

   Some legends are medical folklore, such as the claim that eating
   watermelon seeds will result in a watermelon growing in the stomach, or
   that going outdoors just after showering will result in catching a
   cold.^[45] Many old wives' tales have grown around the identification
   of ailments, real and imagined, and the recommended remedies, rituals,
   and home-grown medical treatments to treat them.^[citation needed]

Internet

   [edit]

   Internet urban legends are those spread through the internet, as
   through Usenet or email^[46] or more recently through other social
   media. They can also be linked to viral online content. Some take the
   form of chain letters and spread by e-mail, directing the reader to
   share them or to meet a terrible fate,^[47] and following a
   recognizable outline of hook, threat, and finally request.^[48]

Paranormal

   [edit]

   Paranormal urban-legend stories usually involve someone encountering
   something supernatural, such as a cryptid^[49]—for instance, Bigfoot or
   Mothman,^[50] legendary creatures for which evidence is lacking but
   which have legions of believers.^[51] Research shows that people
   experiencing sudden or surprising events (such as a Bigfoot sighting)
   may significantly overestimate the duration of the event.^[52]

Marketing

   [edit]

   Companies have been accused of hiding "secret messages" behind their
   logos or packaging,^[53] as in the case of the old Procter & Gamble
   symbol, supposedly an occult figure that gave panache to the brand. (If
   the thirteen stars in the symbol were connected a certain way, it would
   show three sixes in a row or looked at the 3 curls at the bottom they
   form the inverted 6s.)^[54] Similarly, a video of a Christian woman
   "exposing" Monster Energy for using the Hebrew letter vav ( ו ),
   forming the letter "M", to disguise the number 666 went viral on
   Facebook.^[55]
