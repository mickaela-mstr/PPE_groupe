So what is a legend in league what makes them a legend

   Question

   Basically Vi after arcane wasn’t really more powerful than an average
   noxian soldier, but most LOL champs are either hyper powerful or smart.
   Cait is at least a renowned sniper, Akko can go back in time, the only
   questionables. are Vi and silcos henchman what’s her name? So what
   makes a legend because the big problems with arcane is a lot of the
   character don’t really seem all that legendary, more just like a
   glorified influencer and I hated the ending, it was rushed. So in
   league lore what makes a legend. Why are the legends needed and
   summoned.
