   Anyone remember this show? I was surprised to discover this, it's been
   almost 15 years since this show has aired on disney and it gave me
   nostalgia vibes after watching a few episodes.
   What's sad is that the show is pretty much forgotten, there are only a
   few episodes on both vimeo and youtube, so some of it is already lost.

   Why the Sun Chases the Moon (Indonesia)
   The Sun Sisters (Western Australia)
   (edited by phlmhunter to add episode titles)
   I remember this show, looked forward to see the episode on the durian,
   which is nowhere to be found online now. Want to write to Disney
   Channel Asia requesting them to put up the episodes on its YouTube
   channel, but I do not know how I would phrase it.
   Here are other episodes available online:
     * Taro (Japan)
     * Why Man and Animal Don't Live Together (Hmong)

   The uploader of the Western Australia and Hmong episodes, Allan Lau,
   did the music scoring for those episodes. Probably he has more, if he
   did the score for the entire show.
   There is a similar show by Disney Channel Asia from a few years after
   this show, called Guardians. Each episodes featured a festival from an
   Asian country, with an elder narrating the story and a child
   participating in the festival. In the Philippines, it was the Higantes
   that was featured. Guardians is totally lost media, with no episodes
   online. Or perhaps I did not find hard enough?
   If anyone wants to write an article on this on the wiki, Legends of the
   Ring of Fire is partially found media.
   Last Edit: Jul 26, 2018 5:53:23 GMT by phlmhunter: Adding note that
   Legends is partially found media, if anyone decides to do an article on
   the wiki about it

   I just found two articles on this show. One by Magz Osborne on
   Variety.com, the other is from Animated Views. According to the latter,
   six shorts were made. (I thought there were more.) The latter article
   also contained a link to the show's website. It's no longer up, but the
   Wayback Machine was able to save it. It's all in Flash. But everything
   can be saved from the site by a simple print screen.
   I saved screencaps of the site:

   On a roll finding lost media today, hehe. Found another episode, but in
   German: "Wie der Mond entstand"  (Google Translate: "How the moon came
   into being") from Thailand:

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/lJ-HDHdRuD4?wmode=transparent&start=0

   The uploader, Sunil Pote, also uploaded "Why the Sun Chases the Moon"
   from Indonesia (www.youtube.com/watch?v=-71m0XU3BiM), but it seems to
   be reupload since it's similar to the version linked by the OP.
   Anyway, Sunil's blog has contact details if one wants to ask him if he
   has other episodes.
   (potesunil.blogspot.com/2013/10/disneys-legends-of-ring-of-fire.html)
   Also, may anyone archive those episodes currently online? I fear these
   may be lost due to lack of interest.

   Was looking for info about the Philippine episode when I found names of
   people involved with the show. From a Philstar.com (a Philippine news
   site) article from 8 August 2004:
   Walt Disney Television International-Asia Pacific (WDTVI-AP) received
   two World Gold PROMAX Awards for Disney’s Legends of the Ring of Fire,
   the first animated short story series produced by Walt Disney
   Television. Indonesia’s folktale Why the Sun Chases the Moon bagged the
   Gold in the category interstitial/promotainment – Network or Block,
   executive produced by Raymund Miranda and Ashok Miranda. The other Gold
   was for Malaysia’s folktale The Chengal Tree, executive produced by
   Raymund Miranda, Shawn Letts, Kelvin Singh and Ashok Miranda.
   Legends of the Ring of Fire recounts stories from Asian folklore passed
   down from generation to generation. Combining high quality animation
   and memorable soundtracks with the magic of Disney’s unique
   storytelling style, the series captures the hearts and imagination of
   the young and old. It features classic folktales from India, Indonesia,
   Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, Thailand and the Philippines.
   WDTVI-AP’s creative services team headed by executive producer Natalie
   Gee also won a Silver PROMAX Award for Promotional Animation for the
   Studio D opener and a Silver BDA Design Award for Interstitial for
   Behind the Ears: Lilo & Stitch – Something Stitch. Both were produced
   by Senior Graphics Producer Juddee Torres.
   "We are extremely pleased and honored to be presented with these
   awards," says Miranda, who is also the managing director.
   "These awards are a fitting validation of all the hard work and talent
   that go through the creation of each Disney program. We’re especially
   proud of Disney’s Legends of the Ring of Fire as we feel that it
   perfectly showcases Asia’s diverse, colorful and historic cultures and
   traditions," adds Miranda.
   I found another article on Miranda from the same site and his LinkedIn
   profile. He's an executive at ABS-CBN, which is facing challenging
   times right now. Hence, maybe now is not the best time to contact him.
   ---
   I also found this forum post describing all episodes. It cites a
   now-deleted forum post at talkdisney.com. The post is available at the
   Wayback Machine, and cites The Jakarta Post ("By: Tantri Yuliandini
   August 22, 2003 Source: The Jakarta Post"). I cannot find The Jakarta
   Post article, but it is reproduced in jawawa.id, which I don't know
   anything about. If there are Indonesians here, please help. Hence,
   these descriptions remain unverified.
   In the beginning there were nine suns scorching the Earth. The Moon
   felt sorry for the people of Earth and helped them trick the father Sun
   into eating the other suns.
   This is the story of Why the Sun Chases the Moon, based on Indonesian
   folklore for the Disney Channel series Legends of the Ring of Fire.
   - The Cengal Tree, a tale from Malaysia
   Premiere date: Saturday, Aug. 30
   Long, long ago, it rained non-stop such that the earth was flooded. The
   white ants had to flee from their homes to escape the floodwaters. They
   appealed to the trees to seek shelter in their branches, but were
   refused as the trees were afraid that the white ants would eat them
   later. Finally, they approached the big Cengal tree as their last hope,
   and the Cengal tree, who had a soft heart, agreed and struck a bargain
   with the white ants which lasts till this day.
   - How the Moon Came to be, a tale from Thailand
   Premiere date: Saturday, Sept. 13
   Long, long ago, there was a Sun King who ruled the heavens, but there
   was no moon in the sky at night. One day, the Sun King say the
   beautiful daughter of the King of Siam and fell in love with her. He
   refused to go back to his home in the sky as he wanted to stay by her
   side constantly, and night never fell on earth again. The stars, who
   were forced to hide in the clouds, decided on a plan to bring back the
   nights and in doing so created the moon that we see in our skies to
   this day.
   - How Singapore Got Its Name, a tale from Singapore
   Premiere date: Saturday, Sept. 27
   Long, long ago there was a young adventurous king who loved to hunt.
   One day when he was in the jungle hunting for stags, he came a cross a
   beautiful island. Eager to explore it, he set sail immediately and
   encountered the fury of the Sea-King. Upon landing safely on the
   island, a majestic lion-like creature appeared from the jungle and gave
   the king the inspiration to name the island Singapore, which it is
   still known as to this day.
   - The Magic Snail, a tale from Korea
   Premiere date: Saturday, Oct. 11
   There once was a young, hardworking farmer who longed for a wife, and
   made a wish while working in his fields. He heard a reply come from a
   snail and took the snail home out of curiosity. The snail transformed
   into a beautiful lady, whom the farmer fell in love with and they were
   married. One day by chance, the king saw the beautiful snail-lady and
   wanted her for himself, so he challenged the farmer to a test. But with
   the help of his beautiful wife and the Dragon King, the farmer was able
   to overcome all obstacles and win back his wife.
   - How the Durian Came to Be, a tale from the Philippines
   Premiere date: Saturday, Oct. 25
   Long, long ago, a powerful king ruled the Kingdom of the Philippines,
   but he was sad as he had a beautiful young wife who did not love him.
   He decided to seek help from a wise hermit who told him how to win his
   wife's heart by planting a special tree. He succeeded with the help of
   the nymph of the air and held a celebration for the entire kingdom, but
   he forgot to invite the wise hermit. In a rage, the hermit cursed the
   tree and created the fruit we know as durian to this day.
   Based on these descriptions, there are still four missing episodes: the
   tales from Malaysia, Singapore, Korea, and the Philippines.
   Meanwhile, among the found episodes are from Western Australia and
   Japan. This means that there are more than six episodes. Which means
   that I was correct when I said (see post above):
   According to the latter, six shorts were made. (I thought there were
   more.)
   The possibility of more episodes is not a Mandela effect. How many
   exactly were made I plan to ask Mr. Miranda when the time is right.

   So there are six initial episodes plus the Western Australia and Japan
   episodes plus the Hmong episode which I forgot to mention in my last
   post plus the four episodes I mentioned in this post (6 + 2 + 1 + 4),
   for a grand total of 13 episodes.

   I had never of heard of this show, but the few episodes that are
   availble seem great. Haven't located any other episodes but found some
   additional links/info.
   This forum thread that has some assorted concept art (including a shot
   from The Magic Snail) as well as a link to a now dead and not waybacked
   page that stated the series had a total of 13 eps (so good calulation
   phlmhunter).
   IMDB seeems to have a stub article for The Herdsman and the Weaver that
   does not associated it with the larger series. Of the three names
   included only writer Polly Watkins has credits apart from the short.
   Another trail I have found that is already a dead end is the actor who
   voiced the narrator, Jim West, who passed away in 2009
   (https://voiceactors.wordpress.com/tag/james-robert-west/ and
   voice123.com/jimwest) although strangely the first link mentions an
   Emmy for the voice over perfomance that I can't find any proof of.
   However it appears he also recieved a Promax award.
   The only two other major names I have come accross is the director of
   Why the Sun Chases the Moon and the series producer Atul N Rao. Another
   link for Rao mention that he wrote and directed for the series as well.
   A few other minor players, two animators and an audio enginer, include
   the show in their resumes/bios availble online
   Again not sure if any of this will help but just wanted to share what I
   have found. You know this series is obscure when googling Disney
   "Legends of the Ring of Fire" only has 50 results with the ommited
   simlar results active.

   Thank you for the additional info, Amdillae. I'm hoping that they have
   copies of the episodes they worked on, and that they would be willing
   to make them available online. If not, then at least we can ask them
   about their experiences in working on the show.
   I'll contact them in the far future, when I start making my script for
   this show on my YouTube channel. Please check it out. But if you or
   someone else wants to reach out to them now, feel free to do so. Thanks
   again.

   1. Looks like the linked forum thread is an earlier search effort but
   in Spanish. Here's a Google Translate version.
   2. The dead page
   (www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-21167451_ITM) redirects
   to solutions.cengage.com/gale/apps. I'm guessing it's a paid service,
   and subscribers may have access to the original article. May a
   subscriber there check?

   Make that 14. From Staff Writer, with agencies, "Taiwan Quick Take",
   Taipei Times, 1 July 2004:
   Saisiat tale now a cartoon
   The Disney Channel will be airing a five-minute cartoon based on local
   indigenous folklore on Saturday and Sunday at 8:55pm. The cartoon, The
   Lightening Spirit's Daughter: A Tale from Taiwan, is based on a Saisiat
   legend describing how the Saisiat people, who live in Miaoli and
   Hsinchu counties, became farmers. According to the legend, the Saisiat
   were hunters. The lightening god, saddened by the land being left to
   waste, sent his daughter to the Earth where she married a Saisiat man
   and taught the people how to farm. Although she eventually returned to
   the heavens, the Saisiat honor her memory by holding ceremonies each
   year. Disney is showing the cartoon as part of its cartoon series
   Legends of the Ring of Fire,which details myths from Southeast and
   Northeast Asia.

   I'm very thrilled that some people remember this series!!!
   I had the great honour of working on this series, developing,
   co-writing and directing some episodes with Toonz Animation.  Here's
   another episodes you might not have.

   I'm very thrilled that some people remember this series!!!
   I had the great honour of working on this series, developing,
   co-writing and directing some episodes with Toonz Animation.  Here's
   another episodes you might not have.

   Thanks, another upload of the Taro episode is appreciated.
   Though I wish you had contact details, Rao Rao. Would like to ask you
   your experiences in working on this show.
