   The Faculty of Science was created with the inception of the University
   of Lucknow in the year 1921 with four departments of Botany,
   Mathematics, Physics and Zoology. Subsequently, the Department of
   Chemistry was established in 1927. New departments emerged out of these
   such as the Department of Geology evolved from the Department of Botany
   in 1942, Department of Biochemistry evolved from the Department of
   Chemistry in 1955, Department of Statistics from the Department of
   Mathematics and subsequently, the Department of Computer Science and
   the Department of Environmental Sciences were added to the Faculty
   subsequently. Astronomy subject was added to the nomenclature of the
   Department of Mathematics at a very early stage and remains a
   pioneering department of Astronomy at the national level.
   The Faculty of Science represents a research-oriented faculty and has
   produced luminaries such as Prof. Birbal Sahni, FRS and a legend in the
   field of Palaeobotany; Prof. P. S. McMahon, FNI from the University of
   Oxford; Prof. J.A. Strang, a legend of Mathematics; and Prof. A. N.
   Singh, the dynamic mathematician and a legend of Hindu Mathematics and
   Astronomy; the physicists, Dr D. B. Deodhar and Prof. Wali Mohammad; Dr
   G.S. Thapar and Prof. K. N. Bahl belonging to the Department of Zoology
   and many more. Prof. Birbal Sahni also established the Department of
   Geology, whereas Prof. P.S. Krishnan initiated the Department of
   Biochemistry along with Dr Soma Kumar; Prof. B.P. Adhikari and Prof.
   V.S. Huzurbazar laid the foundation of the Department of Statistics.
   Lately, several academic programmes have been added in the Faculty of
   Science such as undergraduate programmes in the areas of Home Science,
   Agriculture, Clinical Nutrition & Dietetics and Post Graduate programme
   in Agriculture. Bachelor of Vocation (B.Voc.) in Gemmology and
   Renewable Energy Technology was also added to the bouquet of the
   Faculty of Science.
