          + About HuntingMarch 24, 2010 We decided to write this page

            blog. There is a good reason. Bad feeling between hunters and
            those don’t like hunting is probably the single  biggest
            reason why there is not a widespread political movement to

            unavoidable.  However, we will step in when they get personal

Rural legends. Examples?

   Ralph Maughan
   August 26, 2008

   It was suggested in another thread that it would be interesting,
   informative and useful to come up with a list and/or discuss what JB
   has called “rural legends.” These would be similar to the well known
   term “urban legends,” but they would be much more common in rural areas
   and deal with the outdoors — wildlife, hunting and fishing, farming,
   grazing, politics related to these things.

   So let’s see if we can discover some.

   Already a number or people have described the belief that the state
   wildlife department or the federal government is dropping,
   transplanting, turning loose, various kinds of undesirable animals in
   rural areas.

   I first heard this rumor in Idaho in the early 1980s when there was the
   persistent rumor that Idaho Fish and Game was turning loose “bad”
   grizzly bears from Yellowstone Park onto Coolwater Ridge, which is a
   tall and broad ridge between the Selway and Lochsa Rivers in north
   central Idaho — hundreds of miles from Yellowstone Park.

   – – – – –

   – more (important) – A rural legend would be a sub-class of urban
   legends according the the Wikipedia article on urban legends. “Despite
   its name, a typical urban legend does not necessarily originate in an
   urban setting. The term is simply used to differentiate modern legend
   from traditional folklore in preindustrial times. For this reason,
   sociologists and folklorists prefer the term \’”contemporary legend.’ ”

   Urban and rural legends are not the same as myths, but they are
   related. Once again, from the Wikipedia,

   The earliest term by which these narratives were known, “urban belief
   tales,” highlights what was then thought to be a key property: they
   were held, by their tellers, to be true accounts, and the device of the
   FOAF was a spurious but significant effort at authentication. The
   coinage leads in turn to the terms “FOAFlore” and “FOAFtale”. While at
   least one classic legend – the “Death Car” — has been shown to have
   some basis in fact, folklorists as such are interested in debunking
   these narratives only to the degree that establishing non-factuality
   warrants the assumption that there must be some other reason why the
   tales are told and believed. As in the case of myth, these narratives
   are believed because they construct and reinforce the of the group
   within which they are told, or “because they provide us with coherent
   and convincing explanations of complex events” For this reason, it is
   characteristic of groups within which a given narrative circulates to
   react very negatively to claims or demonstrations of non-factuality; an
   example would be the expressions of outrage by police officers who are
   told that adulteration of Halloween treats by strangers is extremely
   rare, if it has occurred at all, or the vehement responses.

       Where to begin???? Let’s see…
       Fish & Wildlife brought in coyotes to kill off the deer. (Huh? When
       coys started popping up in KY, there weren’t that many deer! The
       deer population has just exploded in the last 20 or so years.)
       The reintroduced elk all have that mad cow disease. (Uh no… or at
       least to the best of the state veterinarian’s knowledge, none of
       them were carrying CWD. There have been a few cases of some type of
       a “brain worm” but no CWD – thank God!)
       They brought in bears and mountain lions to kill off the diseased
       elk. (See previous statement & hate to tell ’em but there were
       lions & bears in the mountains of Eastern KY loooong before the elk
       introduction took place – no matter what the powers-that-be might
       think!)
       And, my favorite, Fish & Wildlife released rattlesnakes in the
       mountains to try to keep out hunters. (Nope – they’ve been there
       forever too. But I’ve heard that a lot of the “good ol’ boys” used
       to release rattlesnakes around their pot fields to keep people from
       looking too closely. That one’s most likely true!)

       Oh and I forgot this one… When the state deer population was hit by
       a gnat-borne hemorrhagic syndrome last year (similar to blue tongue
       but different), I can’t tell you how many people I tried (mostly
       unsuccessfully) to explain to that it wasn’t “mad cow disease” –
       that it was something totally different! The usual response was
       “Well, that’s what they want you to think!” Ahhh… conspiracy
       theorizing at it’s finest!

       LOL . . Ralph that is a good one. . I hope it was true! The legends
       I have heard from around here are the same ones you always hear
       everywhere I guess. Last week I went out to one of my favorite
       spots in Washington and ran into a road crew that was fixing the
       road I wanted to go down. It was late in the afternoon and the work
       had stopped but the security guard and his family were staying the
       night there to watch the equipment. I talked with him about a slide
       area you couldn’t drive around which they had fixed. . . and then
       he mentioned that he and his family had seen a huge black bear,
       about 350lbs, and that there were a couple of rigs of bear hunters
       chasing him right then and that the big bear was running around
       right where I wanted to ride my bike. So we launched into a talk
       about bears and he told me after he realized I wasn’t “ascared” of
       black bears that now grizzlies . . . that’s another thing, we might
       have some of those around and they are monsters . . they will come
       right in on ya. I wanted to get on to what I came to do so I cut
       him short on that with the fact that I spent a lot of time with
       them in Alaska and as a matter of fact had written a book on them.
       I suspect that had I been a little less knowledgeable about bears I
       would have turned around and gone home. . which actually I did
       after I tracked the bear hunters for a while and realized that 1.
       the bear got away and 2. that they were frustrated and on the ridge
       above me. I am way more “ascared” of a rifle than a bear.

       Here’s a well worn one: “Wolves are putting people are going out of
       business.” I challenge anyone to provide even a single example
       where any rancher or outfitter was even arguably (let alone
       definitively) “put out of business” because of wolf depredation.

       Hal mentioned on the previous post the myth of the great “Canadian
       Wolf,” which is some mutant monster that averages 200 lbs and
       consumes everything in its path.
       A couple of other wolf myths:
       (1) wolves have never killed or attacked anyone in North America.
       In fact, wolf attacks in Alaska and Canada have been documented by
       McNay (here’s the report version:
       http://www.wildlife.alaska.gov/pubs/techpubs/research_pdfs/techb13_
       full.pdf)
       (2) Wolves are “decimating” elk populations across the West. This
       one has been thoroughly scrutinized in previous posts.
       There are so many, I’ll bow out and let others have some fun.

       The reintroduction of wolves was designed to drive the Western
       livestock industry out of business.
    7. Salle Avatar

       August 26, 2008
       And…
       The wolves were also reintroduced to kill all the elk so that they
       could close down hunting and ATVing in the woods in order to drive
       EVERYBODY OUT OF THE WOODS.
       And then, you know, the moose around Yellowstone are decimated by
       the wolves AND that they, get this ~in fifteen years’ time~ have
       evolved.
       Now this gets interesting because there are TWO evolution stories
       here, depending on which “they” you’re going for here;
       a) the moose have evolved in such a way as to have different
       antlers that are now capable of scewering two wolves in one swing
       of their head…
       b) the wolves that were reintroduced to Yellowstone in 1995 were
       NOT the first reintroduction attempt this last century. They were
       actually reintroduced in the late 1980’s from someplace in northern
       Minnesota and let out somewhere near Gardiner and that they were
       some vicious strain of “powerwolf” but the ones from the 1995
       reintroduction were smaller and tamer and they have now interbred
       and “evolved” into a more tolerable “strain” of wolf. Though they
       have still over populated and have eaten all the available elk to
       date.
       Then, did you know that wolves have several litters of pups a year,
       as in several times a year like cats can.?
       They never told me about these things in genetics class!! And I
       didn’t miss a lecture!

       “No sound attracts wolves more than the sound of a laughing or
       crying baby.” I know this one’s gotta be true, because our very own
       Congress critter said so on the floor of the House of
       Representatives.

       Here’s one I heard at the gas station a few weeks ago…The
       government wants to list Polar Bears in order to end hunting. There
       are actually lots of polar bears in the Arctic, but the government
       changes the numbers to say they are endangered just to stop all
       bear hunting and promote the environmentalist global warming
       agenda.

       Hal and JB nailed it.
       The legend of the introduced, insatiable, omnipotent “Canadian
       Wolf” has to be one of the greatest tales ever told. The gist being
       that somehow the feds introduced a version of wolf that was never
       here to begin with and outcompeted the version of the wolf “that
       was already here” in 1995. This alternate strain of wolf kills
       everything, is huge, and wholly fearless of humans. Oh, and it has
       no morals, unlke its smaller, kind-hearted and apparently
       herbivorian brother that was here originally.
       I guess my question is this – do people really think wolves
       recognize, or have ever recognized, international borders?
       If you believe this legend then you believe that wolves in Idaho
       did not historically intermingle with wolves in Canada. Ever.
       But, alas, logic does not rule the day and I am merely laughed at
       by the fiends in their Spire of Mockery!

       “wolves are the cause of the decline in the grouse population.”
       And I thought for sure they’d blame that one on coyotes! I suppose
       wolves are probably to blame for dying sagebrush as well?

       The BLM would have you believe that junipers are the reason for the
       decline of sage grouse populations. I guess that’s not just a rural
       myth but a government sanctioned myth.

       Changing the subject from wolves, there is legend that the grazing

       them with cattle.

       Layton,
       Yes, that would be a myth but to say that wolves primarily kill the
       old, the sick, and the crippled would be accurate. I think that is
       what most educated people say and I would be quick to correct
       anyone who used the word “only” in that regard.

       I can certainly attest that there is no end to the myths concerning
       wolves and the detriment they are to everything in this here god’s
       world. (Based on the earful I get on occasion from some of my
       favorite storytellers!)
       The one about wolves being overpopulated now is widespread, I hear
       it from tourists from other areas of the country. They know next to
       nothing, a great number of the folks I encounter at least, the
       media doesn’t cover it much, and certainly doesn’t care to include
       too much content when they do cover wolf issues.

       Myths I’ve heard:
       Entire herds and flocks being obliterated in one night.
       The wolf’s utter incapacity to control their own number without
       human management.
       Wolves and coyotes interbreeding = super hyper killer mutant wolf
       gumbercules!
       An insatiable longing to stalk and kill children, not to mention
       any other small human owned critter (no offence intended parents).
       The act of making carcass ‘wards’ to scare other wolves off a ranch
       (unfortunately only humans react to such things). Personally I
       think its just showing off – could be mistaken.
       Wolves when hunting:
       – Tearing foetuses out of a living mother ungulate
       – Eating their prey alive* (*sometimes but not a frequent
       occurrence)
       – Being cruel when killing and thoroughly enjoying the act
       Then again we’ve also got the guys who accept the wolf as a
       predator… aka something that needs to be shot on sight because it
       spoils ‘happy time’.

       wait, we forgot the one where wolves were reintroduced by
       vegatarians so thatthey could kill the cows off…
       and woves were an environmentalist scheme to kill all the cattle on
       public lands….
       the pine beetle problem is a result of the government trying to use
       them to control weeds…
       wolves would have died out in the Rockies even if they hadn’t been
       hunted to extinction there….
       wolves kill every animal they come across and leave them there to
       rot….
       all hunters want to keep elk feeding grounds so they can shoot
       bigger bulls and get more cow tags…
       every rancher is a wolf hater….
       women who are menstrating attract wolves…
       coyotes and wolves mate constantly, like rabbits,…

       I really don’t know why you think that the only useful animal to a
       hunter is one that he can kill. Most true sportsmen enjoy all the
       critters and yes even the wolves at times. As far as bigfoot tags
       go, I really don’t feel there numbers are great enough yet for a
       season and personally I hope no matter how many there are they
       won’t open a season. I would however like to train one to pack out
       my elk. I actually own an atv but I don’t hunt from it and with me
       getting older I can’t pack as well as I used to. I’ve been told
       though that the bigfoot is really fond of jerky and with the right
       jerky you can get them to do almost anything. I’ve never tried b-bq
       rats or bigfoot, but with enough catsup you can make anything taste
       better, probably even a wolf.

       cobra: Little bit out of this topic here, nevertheless:
       I have no problem at all with hunting in general – hunting for food
       (delicious!) to be precise. This however does not include what in
       Africa is called, “hunting bushmeat” – animals that are not really
       edible). I have however a problem with huting in so far as over the
       centuries countless species have been driven into extinction or to
       near extinction by over-hunting. I have a severe problem with ego
       hunting. With the “sportsmen” (a term left over from the glory days
       of hunting in the commonwealth I think) putting the lights out of a
       bear, a tiger, a lion, a buffalo, a coyote, an elk, a wolf, or
       whatever it is, just for the fun of it , just because one is able
       to do so! Just to show, with a pelt hanging near the fireplace,
       what a tough guy one is. Just to prove with a picture, where one is
       posing with a sheepish grin behind a bear carcass, or – even worse
       – with one foot on this carcass. I honestly dislike the
       hypocritical (is this the appropriate word?) attitude of our
       (german) hunting organisations: “We accept the presence of those
       wolves only if we are allowed to manage them.”

       Please note my addition to the original post.
       For some help about the nature of urban, and so, rural legends, the
       Wikipedia article about urban legends is useful.

       Ralph, I thought this one deserved moving!
       Moose Says:
       “From the UP of Mich – Insurance companies are funding a lawsuit to
       prevent wolves from being hunted so that the wolves will continue
       to eat all the whitetails and insurnace co.s wouldn’t have to pay
       for so many deer-auto accidents.”
       “I don’t know if you have seen the thread on rural legends. I
       wonder if this would qualify? RM”
       You betcha, eh!

       John,
       I doubt we really want to know. I never saw any tracks around the
       tree, so it may just be a deterant. (Joke’s on them!)
       My uncle reminded me that the elk are “brought in” at night in
       RMNP.
       My daughter said not to forget that cats will suck away your infant
       child’s breath and suffocate them in their sleep. (I told her that
       wasn’t really about wildlife and she reminded me that cats are not
       recognized as domesticated animals, smarty pants!)
       My son told me his friends said that you could sing to bears and
       they’d leave you alone-easy to see where that one came from.
       The latest campaign by republicans boasts that you can drill for
       oil and technology makes it completely safe for the environment!

       Pennsylvania is, arguably, one of the tamest states around, at
       least in the East, but that doesn’t stop some folks from reporting
       having seen a wolf or wolves in the state or Northeast. Here’s a
       comment one of my blog’s recent postings elicited from a reader.
       Cougars also attract the rumor-mill participants (wouldn’t one have
       been road-killed by now, given the presence of so many roads on the
       landscape?).
       “I saw a black wolf in SW Pennsylvania 2 years ago. At first it
       looked like a small-medium bear (due to distance). I ran to my
       truck to grab my spotting scope and was surprised to see that is
       was a wolf. I am a Biologist and so is one other person that was in
       our group. There is no chance that this animal was a coyote. I have
       lived in close proximity to several packs over the years and I know
       this animal was no coyote. I’m also willing to wager that it was no
       wild dog. Unfortunately it was too far away to get decent photos,
       but with the spotting scope we got very good looks.”

       By the way cobra. . your spelling is also correct, just not usual:
       “There were lots of other spellings, too, of which catsup is the
       best known, a modification of catchup. You can blame Jonathan Swift
       for it if you like, since he used it first in 1730: “And, for our
       home-bred British cheer, Botargo, catsup, and caveer”. [Caveer is
       caviar; botargo is a fish-based relish made of the roe of the
       mullet or tunny.] That form was also once common in the US but is
       much less so these days, at least on bottle labels: all the big US
       manufacturers now call their product ketchup.”

       Here were the “legends” I posted on the other thread:
       (1) The Michigan DNR is deliberately introducing cougars in areas
       with high deer densities in order to control the deer population.
       (2) The Ohio DNR has used helicopters to drop rattlesnakes into
       rural areas; apparently (no joke) the rattlesnakes were wearing
       PARACHUTES.

       Here’s another rural legend:
       The mullet is a good hairstyle 😉
       I’ll also move my rural legend comments:
       I remember hearing a story from an IDFG person about how he was
       confronted by someone in Riggins, Idaho about how the IDFG was
       stocking grizzly bears, wolves, and rattlesnakes in the area.
       I’ve also heard the stories about Yellowstone rangers being asked
       questions like:
       Why do they put the blue stuff in the lake?
       Why are the those little red dogs hanging out with the buffalo?
       When do the deer turn into elk/moose?
       As a fisheries person I overheard someone explaining that the trout
       hanging out with the salmon were bull trout that were going to dig
       up the eggs so they could eat them. They were actually jack Chinook
       salmon, or males that only spend one year in the ocean as compared
       to 2 or three. FYI, they die just like the rest of them. That’s the
       biggest misconception I would run across with people.

       “The first outlined stage is a scarcity of wild game, be it due to
       habitat loss, seasonal migration or often times over-predation.
       Wolves begin approaching human habitations, though limiting their
       visits to nocturnal hours. Their presence is usually established by
       barking matches with local dogs.
       After a certain amount of time, wolves begin to frequent human
       habitations in daylight hours and observe people and livestock at a
       distance.
       The wolves begin acting bolder by attacking small stock and pets at
       daylight, sometimes pursuing their prey up to verandas. The wolves
       at this point do not focus on humans, but will growl and act
       threateningly toward them.
       The wolves begin attacking large bodied livestock and may follow
       riders.
       People begin to be harassed, usually in a playful manner. The
       wolves will chase people over short distances and nip at them,
       though will retreat if confronted.
       Wolves begin to attack people in predatory fashions. ”

       I came across you guys while looking for locations or anything on
       the email pictures going around of elk in someone’s Rocky Mountain
       suburban neighborhood. But while I’m here, can anyone tell me for
       sure once and for all the lowdown on bears and their people attacks
       and omnivorous behaviors? I was taught that the grizzlys and polars
       will attack people for food as well as self defense, but that other
       smaller bears only attack people in defense. Then I heard that all
       bears (except for pandas) will attack people for food. What’s the
       legend and what’s the truth of it?

       Let’s not forget the wily critter of the plains and sagebrush. The
       trophy Jack-a-lope. A friend of mine had a sporting goods store in
       western colorado when I lived there. I would help him out at times
       with bore sighting rifles for the out of state hunters that would
       come into the store to buy their elk and deer tags. He had a
       Jack-a-lope mount on the wall and you wouldn’t believe how many
       people would belive that he had actually taken it not 5 miles from
       the store, some even asked if they had tags available. Those are
       the years I wore extra orange during the season and probably a big
       reason I started archery hunting more than rifle hunting.

       LisaM,
       Actually black bears have attacked more people than any of the
       others, but there are more black bears living where there are more
       people so there are more encounters. Personally I don’t trust any
       of them and respect all the predators, actually all wild animals.
       The only bear I’ve ever had to dispose of had been wounded a week
       prior to our meeting by some other hunters that made a bad shot, he
       fell seven feet from my rifle barrel and scared the hell out of me
       at full charge, this however is not normal and he was a black. I’ve
       had black bears close several times and they will dance on there
       forepaws back and forth woofing and huffing sometimes popping their
       teeth so loud you would think they would break, but every time I’ve
       seen this I back out slowly and other than maybe having to clean
       out my drawers haven’t had problem. I’ve read many books on
       documented bear attacks and all species will attack under the right
       circumstances. The main thing to do when in the woods I think is
       mainly be aware of your surroundings, pay attention to the tracks
       and scat, certain areas during certain times of the year are used
       more often than others by bears. Personally in North Idaho we have
       more encounters with moose than bears. Their big and can get kind
       of crazy during the rut and calving season.

       thanks guys – a friend of mine forwarded those pictures, vicki – I
       was just wondering where they were taken, but there was nothing
       there except “rocky mountains”.
       So, do black bears attack people and deer, etc., for food
       regularly? I was under the impression that, like wolves, they
       normally kept to smaller stuff and fish, and being omnivorous, also
       relied on vegetation, so that they normally left people alone. I
       know about the tying up your grub when you’re out there, so the
       bears won’t get it, but there’s never really any warning about the
       bears getting You, unless you come between them and their food, or
       their younguns.

       I liked this on,
       Ranger tells everyone to wear bells around their neck and carry
       pepper spray to ward off bear attack. The bells alert the bears to
       your presence and the spray is a last ditch, ten feet, “hail Mary”,
       when all else fails. He tells the hikers that there are two kinds
       of bears in the area: Grizzlies and Black bears. He then tells them
       that they need to recognize the bear’s scat so they can tell the
       two species apart. He sez that black bears are much less likely to
       attack, so when they see black bear scat, they may continue. But if
       they encounter grizzly scat, they should give the area a wide
       berth.
       A tourist asks how to tell the difference. The ranger replies,”
       Easy, black bears are grazers, more than fish eaters. The black
       bear scat is usually full of blackberry seeds, hackberrys and
       acorns and other plant life and it smells like almonds. Grizzly
       scat is larger and it is full of bells and smells like pepper
       spray….
