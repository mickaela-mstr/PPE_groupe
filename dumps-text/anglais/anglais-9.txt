Bogus St. Patrickâ€™s Day Legends and What We Can Memorialize

   Being born on March 17, and having an Irish surname leads me to have
   more reflections and conversations about St. Patrickâ€™s Day than the
   average person, as I wrote two years ago. This time weâ€™re going to look
   at some of the myths related to the man, St. Patrick.

Shamrocks

   Legend has it that British-born St. Patrick used a shamrock to teach
   Irish pagans about the trinity. However, thereâ€™s a few problems with
   this:

   1) The word shamrock doesnâ€™t come into use until a thousand years after
   St. Patrickâ€™s death and it took nearly as long for this legend to
   develop.
   2) Thereâ€™s disagreement on if there actually is such a thing as a
   shamrock and, if it they exist, if theyâ€™re capable of growing in
   non-Irish soil.
   3) Most significantly, St. Patrick never alludes to anything like this
   in his only two extant writings, the Confessio and the Epistola. Aside
   from these two documents, we really donâ€™t know anything else about
   Irelandâ€™s British Bishop.

Snakes

   Ever heard about St. Patrick chasing all the snakes out of Ireland?
   Uh-uh. Nope. Didnâ€™t happen since the island never had snakes. And,
   again, he never wrote anything about chasing, killing, or even
   screaming and running away from snakes. Nobody mentions this legend
   until 600 years after the approximate date of his death.

   And, about that date. March 17 is said to be St. Patrickâ€™s date of
   death, not birth. Nobody recorded the date, it just showed up on
   liturgical calendar centuries later.

Slavery

   Patrickâ€™s father had a successful business, enriched by slave labor.
   Ironically, Patrick was kidnapped from Britain and sold into slavery in
   Ireland at age 16. After six-years-a-slave, Patrick escaped back to
   Britain. He trained for the ministry and dreamed that God was calling
   him to go back to preach in Ireland. He was enslaved again for a short
   period of time, but Patrick refused to be deterred from his purpose,
   describing himself as being bound by the Spirit to minister in the land
   of his captivity.

Souls over Gold

   As soon as Valentineâ€™s Day ends, naked cupids are displaced by
   leprechauns (clothed, thankfully) on retail shelves. Is this a case of
   Roman icons being gentrified by Irish ones? Anyway, the clever little
   creatures with pots of gold at the end of rainbows have nothing to do
   with St. Patrick. This saint developed a love for souls over gold and
   argued for people to be prized over possessions.

   St. Patrick wrote his fiery Epistola as a call for repentance and
   reparations from those who had killed, enslaved, and sold women and men
   he had just baptized and anointed. In doing so, he was putting his life
   on the line for a wholistic ministry. He wasnâ€™t satisfied with peopleâ€™s
   soulâ€™s being saved while their bodies were in bondage:

     It is not that I would choose to let anything so blunt and harsh
     come from my mouth, but I am driven by the zeal for God. And the
     truth of Christ stimulates me, for love of neighbors and children:
     for these, I have given up my homeland and my parents, and my very
     life to deathâ€¦

     The Most High does not accept the gifts of evildoers. The one who
     offers a sacrifice taken from what belongs to the poor is like one
     who sacrifices a child in the very sight of the childâ€™s father.
     Riches, says Scripture, which a person gathers unjustly, will be
     vomited out of that personâ€™s stomach. The angel of death will drag
     such a one away, to be crushed by the anger of dragons.

   St. Patrick continued by urging his followers to resist flattering
   these traffickers and to boycott them instead:

     [A]ll the holy and humble of heart should not fawn on such people,
     nor even share food or drink with them, nor accept their alms, until
     such time as they make satisfaction to God in severe penance and
     shedding of tears, and until they set free the men-servants of God
     and the baptised women servants of Christ, for whom he died and was
     crucified.

   Shouldnâ€™t commemorations of St. Patrickâ€™s legacy set higher goals than
   wearing green clothes, eating green cookies and cupcakes, and turning
   rivers green for a day? Why not draft modern versions of the Epistola,
   instead of getting drunk on green beer?
