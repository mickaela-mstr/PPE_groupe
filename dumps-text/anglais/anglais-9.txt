Bogus St. Patrick’s Day Legends and What We Can Memorialize

   Being born on March 17, and having an Irish surname leads me to have
   more reflections and conversations about St. Patrick’s Day than the
   average person, as I wrote two years ago. This time we’re going to look
   at some of the myths related to the man, St. Patrick.

Shamrocks

   Legend has it that British-born St. Patrick used a shamrock to teach
   Irish pagans about the trinity. However, there’s a few problems with
   this:

   1) The word shamrock doesn’t come into use until a thousand years after
   St. Patrick’s death and it took nearly as long for this legend to
   develop.
   2) There’s disagreement on if there actually is such a thing as a
   shamrock and, if it they exist, if they’re capable of growing in
   non-Irish soil.
   3) Most significantly, St. Patrick never alludes to anything like this
   in his only two extant writings, the Confessio and the Epistola. Aside
   from these two documents, we really don’t know anything else about
   Ireland’s British Bishop.

Snakes

   Ever heard about St. Patrick chasing all the snakes out of Ireland?
   Uh-uh. Nope. Didn’t happen since the island never had snakes. And,
   again, he never wrote anything about chasing, killing, or even
   screaming and running away from snakes. Nobody mentions this legend
   until 600 years after the approximate date of his death.

   And, about that date. March 17 is said to be St. Patrick’s date of
   death, not birth. Nobody recorded the date, it just showed up on
   liturgical calendar centuries later.

Slavery

   Patrick’s father had a successful business, enriched by slave labor.
   Ironically, Patrick was kidnapped from Britain and sold into slavery in
   Ireland at age 16. After six-years-a-slave, Patrick escaped back to
   Britain. He trained for the ministry and dreamed that God was calling
   him to go back to preach in Ireland. He was enslaved again for a short
   period of time, but Patrick refused to be deterred from his purpose,
   describing himself as being bound by the Spirit to minister in the land
   of his captivity.

Souls over Gold

   As soon as Valentine’s Day ends, naked cupids are displaced by
   leprechauns (clothed, thankfully) on retail shelves. Is this a case of
   Roman icons being gentrified by Irish ones? Anyway, the clever little
   creatures with pots of gold at the end of rainbows have nothing to do
   with St. Patrick. This saint developed a love for souls over gold and
   argued for people to be prized over possessions.

   St. Patrick wrote his fiery Epistola as a call for repentance and
   reparations from those who had killed, enslaved, and sold women and men
   he had just baptized and anointed. In doing so, he was putting his life
   on the line for a wholistic ministry. He wasn’t satisfied with people’s
   soul’s being saved while their bodies were in bondage:

     It is not that I would choose to let anything so blunt and harsh
     come from my mouth, but I am driven by the zeal for God. And the
     truth of Christ stimulates me, for love of neighbors and children:
     for these, I have given up my homeland and my parents, and my very
     life to death…

     The Most High does not accept the gifts of evildoers. The one who
     offers a sacrifice taken from what belongs to the poor is like one
     who sacrifices a child in the very sight of the child’s father.
     Riches, says Scripture, which a person gathers unjustly, will be
     vomited out of that person’s stomach. The angel of death will drag
     such a one away, to be crushed by the anger of dragons.

   St. Patrick continued by urging his followers to resist flattering
   these traffickers and to boycott them instead:

     [A]ll the holy and humble of heart should not fawn on such people,
     nor even share food or drink with them, nor accept their alms, until
     such time as they make satisfaction to God in severe penance and
     shedding of tears, and until they set free the men-servants of God
     and the baptised women servants of Christ, for whom he died and was
     crucified.

   Shouldn’t commemorations of St. Patrick’s legacy set higher goals than
   wearing green clothes, eating green cookies and cupcakes, and turning
   rivers green for a day? Why not draft modern versions of the Epistola,
   instead of getting drunk on green beer?

No More Going Back

   Have you ever wanted to order or purchase some product or service only
   to discover that the price advertised or shown, was not really the true
   bottom line and that there were additional fees attached? Yes, if you
   are like me, I am tired of paying additional fees for something I
   consider basic and should be included with the service. In today’s
   Money Monday we explore some ideas on how to avoid or beat the extra
   fees game. Credit or Debit: While less people walk around today with
   cash in their wallets or purses, the truth is that cash still remains
   king! There are some services or businesses on which surcharges are
   imposed. A surcharge is nothing more than an extra fee or tax imposed
   on an item beyond the regular price. For example gas stations or
   resturants impose a surcharge or extra fee on purchases made by credit
   card. The extra fee may range from 1.5% to 3.5% of the product or
   service cost just because you paid for it by using your credit card. So
   the next time you want to fill up your gas tank, you may want to
   consider using a debit card or cash. The key point here is that by law,
   a business is prohibited from charging you an extra fee when you pay by
   debit card. Travel Fees: We have all fallen victim or have been tempted
   to pay some additional fee to purchase a seat from the airline when
   traveling. I hate to pay an extra $10.00 or $15.00 for a seat when
   purchasing a ticket. The may way to avoid paying for your seat is to
   opt out of purchasing a ticket, which is a choice I make regularly. Now
   I will admit that this strategy comes with the risk of you being
   assigned a middle seat on the flight. How do I reduce the middle seat
   assignment? You arrive at the airport early. That way you can negotiate
   for a change of seating since lots of people arrive later to check in,
   which provides you with a greater opportunity of obtaining a window or
   aisle seat thereby avoiding the extra seating fee. Finally, if it's a
   short flight, I’m more likely to opt out of paying the extra seats fee
   and take the risk of being assigned a middle row seat. Car Rental
   Insurance : I am sure most people are aware that if you rent a vehicle,
   you can use your personal private vehicle insurance to insure your
   rental. Applying your personal vehicle insurance to your rental allows
   you to avoid purchasing insurance from the rental company. While that
   may be common knowledge, there are a few things of which you need to be
   aware. First your private vehicle auto insurance policy should cover
   both collision and comprehensive or else your rental will be
   underinsured in the event of an accident. Secondly, when obtaining a
   car rental you may want to consider using a credit card which offers
   car rental insurance especially if you are leaving the country. What is
   important to note is that while you may use a credit card which
   provides car rental insurance; most of these credit cards exclude
   places such as Italy, Australia, Israel and Jamaica from their
   coverage. Chase bank credit cards, offer the best car rental benefits
   when considering which credit card to use for vehicle rentals.
   Entertainment: According to the Government Accountability Office, the
   average fee for purchasing a concert or sports ticket is 27% of the
   ticket cost. As a Los Angeles Lakers fan, I refuse to pay those fees
   for a game ticket. The best way to avoid or reduce paying fees, while
   not convenient, is to purchase your ticket at the venue’s box office
   instead. If your team does not win the game, at least you would have
   saved some money in the process. WHAT’S UP! Today’s What’s Up is about
   how much money you should keep in your checking account. Interest rates
   on checking accounts are paying about 0.008 so keeping lots of money in
   your checking account does not make sense today. The recommendation
   from some banking officials is that you retain one month’s operating or
   monthly living expenses in your checking account.. At most they suggest
   you retain two months of your living expenses in your operating or
   checking account. If it’s not earning or working for you, why keep it
   in your checking account? And that’s what’s up! Ruthven R. Phillip,

When It’s Supposed to Be The Most Wonderful Time of the Year, But, It’s Not!

   A Holiday Gift That Makes A Difference - Ruthven R Phillip, Esq We have
   entered what some would call the most wonderful time of the year with
   holiday shopping, food, football, friends and family. It’s a time when
   we make list and decide on who will get what gift and how much they
   will cost. But this holiday season, i am suggesting you do something
   different and give a gift that can change a young person’s life or have
   lifelong impact. What I am referring to you may ask? I am referring to
   instead of making that traditional gift of clothes and toys, how about
   making a gift to that young person’s 529 plan for educational purposes.
   Sure!It is not sexy at the moment, but it can provide an education
   which will have lasting impact. What are 529 Plans: A 529 plan is also
   known as a Qualified Tuition Program which came into existence in 1996.
   Each program is administered by a state or state agency and allows
   contributions from parents, friends or family members on behalf of a
   beneficiary, usually a child or children into this fund. 529 plans are
   widely known as accounts in which funds are deposited, saved and used
   to pay for future educational expenses. While that is true, these plans
   can also be used tp prepay college tuition at a qualified higher
   education institution. How Does It Work : As mentioned there are two
   ways to engage in a 529 plan. The first is through prepayment of a
   child’s educational expenses at an educational institution.
   Contributing through this option allows for the prepayment of all or a
   portion of the child’s future college tuition at today’s rates which
   can protect against future increases. The idea is to lock in your 529
   contributions and thereby your investing to an account which will
   mirror increases in tuition rates should they escalate. When you think
   about it, this 529 option seems likely to make the most sense, but
   there are some significant restrictions associated. Using the prepaid
   529 plans means that they can only be applied to in state colleges.
   With a traditional or non prepayment 529 plan you are allowed to choose
   the investment portfolio. However, with a prepayment plan you are not
   allowed to choose your investments, since the plan manager is focused
   on ensuring that your investment keeps pace with raising tuition cost.
   Another drawback of the prepaid 529 option is that if your child does
   not attend college or chooses to attend an out of state college, you
   may face restrictions or penalties in withdrawing the funds. The second
   and more popular option is where you can choose your 529 contribution
   fund as an investment account in accordance with the managing agency
   options. Plan Flexibility : In the past these plans were more rigid,
   but with the passage of rule changes, you now have more options to
   explore. If you child who is a beneficiary has graduated and there is
   still money in your plan, that money can be used for another child even
   if they are not your own. The unexpended 529 money can be used to
   assist a cousin, nephew or other family members without tax
   consequences so long as it is used for qualified education expenses or
   for qualifying educational institution tuition. Let’s not also forget
   the money can be used by the parent if he or she decides to pursue
   further education. Another flexible 529 option is for you to convert
   the unexpended funds into a Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA).
   Yes, under the SECURE Act 2.0 you are now allowed to convert that money
   into an IRA for your kids and thereby providing them with a jump start
   on their retirement saving plan. Further, you can leave the excess or
   unused 529 contributions in the account and allow it to grow tax free.
   There is no statute of limitation as to how long you can leave your
   contribution in your state sponsored plan which also allows you to use
   the plan for your grandchildren. Not only that, if you wanted to assist
   your child with their student loan payments; the 529 funds could be
   used up to $10,000.00 to do so. The Takeaway: According to the
   Education Data Initiative, only 30% of families use a college saving
   plan such as 529 to help prepare them to face the rising cost of
   education. This show that not enough people are taking advantage of
   this tax benefit from a state perspective, since in some states those
   contributions are deductible. This data also underscores the need for
   us to embrace an opportunity to give a gift during this holiday season,
   which can contribute to changing a child’s life. You might want to
   reconsider those gifts on your christmas list, and evaluate where you
   can have greater impact both now and in the future. WHAT’S UP! Today’s
   What’s Up is about getting money out of your retirement without
   incurring a 10% penalty. If you have received terminal medical news,
   you can withdraw from your retirement without incurring a 10% tax
   penalty. Before you draw down any money though, you will have to obtain
   a doctor’s certification. Also, if you live or have experienced a
   federally declared disaster, you can drawdown on your retirement
   without incurring ant tax penalty. And that’s what’s up! Ruthven R.
