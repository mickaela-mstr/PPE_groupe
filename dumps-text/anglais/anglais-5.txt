   Portrait of Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt

   Thomas Jefferson, President 1801-1809

Fun Facts About Thomas Jefferson

   Born on April 13, 1743, Thomas Jefferson was a leading figure in our
   country’s quest for independence. A native of Virginia, Jefferson also
   played important roles in the early history of our fledgling nation as
   its Minister to France, Secretary of State and third President.

   A true Renaissance man, Jefferson is known for his many talents in
   writing, economics, religion and philosophy as well as horticulture and
   mathematics. He spoke 6 languages including English, French, Greek,
   Italian, Latin and Spanish. He also had a love for the written word,
   having written over 19,000 letters in his lifetime.

A Multi-Talented Thinker

   Jefferson was an inventor, lawyer and educator. He graduated from the
   University of William and Mary at the age of 18, two years after he
   enrolled in 1762. He was the designer of Monticello, the Virginia State
   Capital and The Rotunda at the University of Virginia among other
   notable buildings. His influential style has become known as
   “Jeffersonian Architecture”. Monticello and The Rotunda are both World
   Heritage Sites.

He Went on a Hunger Strike (and Encouraged Others to Join Him)

   As a member of Virginia’s House of Burgesses, Jefferson called for a
   day of prayer and fasting in support of the citizens of Boston when the
   British government closed the harbor in response to the Boston Tea
   Party. As he had hoped, this action allied Virginia with the Patriots’
   cause in Massachusetts and fueled opposition to the Intolerable Acts.

He Was the Major Pen of the Declaration of Independence

   At the age of 33, Thomas Jefferson was one of the youngest delegates to
   the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia. He became acquainted
   with John Adams, a leader of the Congress, and through this budding
   friendship, Jefferson was appointed to the Committee of Five that was
   tasked with drafting the Declaration of Independence. Over the next 17
   days, he would create the first draft. Jefferson is considered by many
   to be the primary author of the document because the committee left
   intact more than 75 percent of his original draft. Many believed that
   John Adams would be the primary author of this important document, but
   he had persuaded the Committee to choose Jefferson instead. The
   preamble is regarded as one of the most enduring statements of human
   rights and the phrase “all men are created equal” is considered one of
   the most well-known expressions in the English language. Jefferson was
   an eloquent writer, but did not fancy himself a public speaker, and
   chose to show his support of the Patriot cause through written
   correspondence.

Writing to Justify the Actions of Discontent Bostonians

   In 1774, Jefferson penned a pamphlet entitled “A Summary View of the
   Rights of British Americans”. In the pamphlet, he outlined a set of
   grievances that the colonies had against King George III. Jefferson
   also wrote that “an exasperated people” who felt oppression, when given
   the chance, would act out in defiance. The perfect example of this
   defiance was the “destruction of the tea”, or what would become known
   as the Boston Tea Party. Like his colleagues George Washington
   and Benjamin Franklin, Jefferson believed the act was destruction of
   private property subject to local laws, but his pamphlet outlined why
   it was justified as an act of political protest.

His Proudest Moments

   Jefferson’s grave is inscribed with an epitaph of the three things of
   which he was the proudest. They are his authorship of the Declaration
   of Independence, the Statute of Virginia that guaranteed religious
   freedom and his founding of the University of Virginia in 1819. There
   is no mention of him being President on his gravestone.

A Family Man

   Jefferson married Martha Wayles Skelton, a widow, in 1772. He fathered
   six children, though only two daughters survived to adulthood.
   Throughout his life, Jefferson had twelve grandchildren; several of
   them having lived with him at Monticello. Jefferson loved to play with
   his grandchildren, teaching them how to play chess and a game called
   Goose. (Goose was one of the first board games in the United States,
   rather similar to our modern version of Chutes and Ladders.) After his
   wife died, historians believe he began a relationship with Sally
   Hemings, one of his slaves. After his death, Jefferson’s daughter
   allowed Hemings to live as a free woman in Charlottesville until she
   died in 1835. DNA tests in 2000 show a familial gene common between
   their descendants.

A Controversial Start to His Presidency

   It was only after the chaotic election of 1800 between Jefferson
   and John Adams that Congress decided to ratify the 12th Amendment to
   the Constitution. The debacle occurred when Jefferson received the same
   number of electoral votes as his running mate Aaron Burr and Burr
   refused to concede the election. The House of Representatives decided
   the election after 36 ballots on February 17, 1801. They chose
   Jefferson as President and Burr as Vice President.

Landmark Acquisition

   Early in his presidency, Jefferson was able to achieve one of the
   greatest acquisitions of his political career with the Louisiana
   Purchase, which more than doubled the size of the United States. The
   529,000,000-acre tract of land is one of the most fertile on Earth and
   eliminated the nation’s reliance on other countries for its food.
   Jefferson did not believe the Constitution gave him the power to make
   the $15 million land acquisition, but agreed with Congress to make the
   purchase. He appointed Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to lead an
   expedition known as the Corps of Discovery to explore the newly
   acquired territory. Sacagawea, who both men acknowledged as providing
   an indispensable service, accompanied them on the journey.

Lifelong Connection

   After meeting at the Second Continental Congress in 1775, Thomas
   Jefferson and John Adams became lifelong friends. Their relationship
   deepened through years of letter-writing, including letters written
   between Abigail Adams and Jefferson. They spent years in France
   together as Jefferson and Adams served as trade ministers in Europe.
   The two remained close friends despite their political differences;
   that is, until Jefferson beat Adams in the Election of 1801 to become
   President of the United States. They resumed their close friendship
   after about 10 years of separation. Both Thomas Jefferson and John
   Adams died on July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of
   Independence. Legend holds that Adams’ last words were “Thomas
   Jefferson survives.” Unbeknownst to Adams, Jefferson had died a few
   hours earlier. They were the last surviving members of the original
   group of Patriots that became known as America’s Founding Fathers.
   Jefferson and Adams also share the distinction of being the only
   Declaration of Independence signatories who would later serve as
   President.

He Lives On

   In addition to the Jefferson Memorial near the Tidal Basin in
   Washington, D.C., he is immortalized on the $2 bill, the nickel and as
   one of the figures of Mount Rushmore. The memorial in the nation’s
   capital, featuring a 19-foot tall statue of Jefferson, was dedicated in
   1943 on the 200th anniversary of his birth.
