   Wrap Legend in Stacked Charts

   09-25-2020 02:49 AM

   Hi,


   Is there any way to wrap the legend on a stacked chart? I need it at
   the bottom center (left or right doesn't work so much for me).


   Thanks in advance!

   Here is one work with legend text getting cut off or when you have long
   legend values:

   1. Turn off legends on the various visuals you want to display

   2. Create a Treemap visual with same data columns. Place its legend on
   "Top Left ". Reduce height of the Tree Map visual so that only the
   Legend displays. I set it to 60px and only the legend was showing. I
   set the width of the tree map visual as wide as possible to accomodate
   long values in my Legend's data category.


   Hope this helps.

   Hi @Anonymous

   If you go to the legends options you can set the position of the

   That's right, buddy @MFelix . Though I am asking for something such as
   a legend wrap since I have quite a few categories and can't go about
   expanding the graph size. The other obvious way around it is placing
   the legend to the left or right, though I need it at the bottom
   center.


   In Excel, for example, the legend can be fit in two/three parallel
   lines. Don't see that happening here.

   Hi @Anonymous
    ,


   There is no such option for legend wrap in Power BI now . I suggest you
   create an idea for it in
   https://ideas.powerbi.com/forums/265200-power-bi-ideas to improve the
   Power BI.


   As a workaround, you can create a custom legend by column chart. For
   detailed steps, you can refer to the
   video: https://community.powerbi.com/t5/forums/replypage/board-id/power
   -bi-designer/message-id/592887


   If this post helps, then please consider Accept it as the solution to
   help the other members find it more quickly.


   Best Regards,

   Hi @Anonymous
    ,


   There is no option on the legends for wraping values, one option can be
   to make some sort of a table or matrix visualization and used it as
   your legend if you group the two together the final user won't realize
   they are looking at different visuals however this depends on the data.
