Local Legends

   The Local Legend (LCL) achievement is awarded to the athlete who
   completes a given segment the most over a rolling 90-day period
   regardless of pace or speed. The LCL achievement will be awarded on
   run, ride, walk, hike, alpine/backcountry/nordic ski, and snowboard
   segments.

How it Works

   The segment details page will display a Local Legend section listing
   the leading athlete. Strava subscribers can tap on this section to see
   how your efforts compare to the current LCL, overall efforts, women’s
   efforts, and your mutual follower’s efforts.

   To earn the Local Legend achievement, you must match to the segment
   more times than any other athlete in the past 90 days.
     * Efforts older than 90 days will be removed from the overall effort
       count.
     * You can become the LCL regardless of your pace or speed recorded on
       the segment.
     * Only activities visible to “Everyone” will count towards your
       efforts. Learn more about activity privacy controls here.

   You will receive a Local Legends "Laurel" crown icon next to the
   segment on your activity page as well as on the segment details page.
   To view all your local legends' achievements, from the mobile app, open
   the You tab and tap your profile picture from the top navigation bar.
   Select Segments > Local Legends on the next page. From the Strava
   website, hover over your profile picture in the upper right and select
   My Profile > Local Legends.

   Segment efforts completed before the day the segment was created will
   not count towards Local Legends. This means that you may see less than
   90 days of activity on segments that were recently created.

Opting Out of Local Legends

   Activities will only count towards the Local Legends feature if their
   privacy settings are adjusted to "Everyone". You can opt out of all
   Local Legends competitions from the Local Legends section of any
   eligible segment or from your privacy settings page. Once you’ve left
   Local Legends, your activities will not be counted towards a Local
   Legends achievement on any segment. If you’d like to rejoin again in
   the future, only activities from the day you rejoin and on will be
   counted.
     * From the mobile app:
          + On the mobile app, open your settings from the Settings
            Icon.jpg icon in the upper right corner of the You tab.
               o Tap Privacy Controls > Local Legends > select No One
          + To open a segment page, select Maps > Segments.
               o Tap on the segment name from the map to open the segment
                 details page, and then tap on See Details.
               o Scroll down and then tap on Most Efforts under “Segment
                 Competitions.”
               o Tap on the ellipsis or "i" icon in the upper right-hand
                 corner then select Leave Local Legends and follow the
                 prompt to confirm your choice.

          + To open your privacy settings, go to your settings page by
            hovering over your profile picture in the top right and
            selecting Settings.
               o Select Privacy Controls from the left-hand navigation
                 menu and choose No One under Local Legends.
          + To open a segment page, select Maps from the top navigation
            bar and Segments from the map page.

                 right-hand side of the page.

                 option to Leave Local Legends.

Local Legends on Zwift Segments

   As of October 2021, select segments from Zwift are eligible for Local
   Legends achievements. Email notifications about LCL achievements on
   Zwift segments will not be sent initially. In the future, notifications
   can be controlled from the email notifications page on the Strava
   website.

   Currently, Local Legends is only available for select Zwift segments.
   There’s no way to add Local Legends to a segment that doesn’t already
   have it, depending on popularity and engagement segments may be added
   over time as we continue to improve this feature.

FAQs

Can I unsubscribe from emails about the Local Legends' achievements?

   Yes, you can unsubscribe from these communications from the email
   notifications page on the website.
