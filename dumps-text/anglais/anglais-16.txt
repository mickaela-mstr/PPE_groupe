Why Are Arthurian Legends So Popular?

   It is wholly possible that you have come across an adaptation of
   Arthurian legend at some point in your life. After all, there have been
   so many interpretations across varying genres and media that an entire
   Wikipedia page has been dedicated to listing them all. One of the most
   well-known works includes Sir Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur. It has
   been deemed the most extensive and culturally important work based on
   Arthurian legends. This is because it goes in-depth into the histories
   of many characters, notably the more prominent Knights of the Round
   Table and Arthur himself. Le Morte d’Arthur has inspired other great
   works, such as T.H. White’s The Once and Future King. Arthurian legends
   have also been often referenced in parodies, such as Monty Python and
   the third Shrek movie. With all these different retellings of Arthurian
   legend, it becomes clear that they are widely celebrated even within
   pop culture. That leads us to the question, why are Arthurian legends
   so popular in the first place?

   The general storyline of Arthurian legends goes something like this:
   Arthur, guided by the eccentric wizard Merlin, obtains the legendary
   sword Excalibur and becomes King of Camelot. In some versions, he
   acquires the sword from the Lady of the Lake. In others, he retrieves
   the sword from its immovable place in stone. He then held court in
   Camelot and was aided by the many Knights of the Round Table, his rule
   peaceful and prosperous. Eventually, King Arthur and the Knights set
   off on a quest to find the immortality-granting Holy Grail. While they
   are away, Lancelot, one of the Knights of the Round Table, engages in
   adultery with Queen Guinevere. An enraged King Arthur starts a civil
   war upon receiving word of the affair. However, King Arthur’s rule was
   ultimately brought to an end when he was betrayed by the Camelot’s
   regent, Mordred, who sought to seize the throne for himself. The
   resulting battle ended with both King Arthur and Mordred meeting their
   demise. After his death, King Arthur was sent on a boat to Avalon,
   where he is presumed to remain until today. It is said that someday
   when Great Britain is in dire need, King Arthur will return to save his
   people.

   It is likely that Arthurian legends are popular due to its character
   archetypes and storytelling. Arthurian legends feature characters that
   possess distinct personalities or capabilities yet still leave a lot of
   room open for interpretation. This is especially the case for
   characters who are fan favourites, including Merlin, Morgan le Fay, and
   Lancelot. There are retellings centred around these specific
   characters. For instance, BBC’s Merlin series and 1974 French drama
   Lancelot du Lac. Many characters in Arthurian legends represent beloved
   archetypes commonly found in literature. As an example, King Arthur
   expectedly falls under the Hero archetype. This is evident through his
   tremendous courage and dignity making him the perfect example of
   chivalry. He is able to triumph in multiple challenges throughout his
   life and manages to ensure peace while he remains King. Archetypes can
   also be easily assigned to other characters in Arthurian legend. An
   example would be Merlin, who falls under the Mentor archetype. Equipped
   with knowledge and magical abilities, Merlin acted as an advisor to
   Arthur as he was growing up, hence becoming a great influence to
   Arthur. The Hero and Mentor archetypes as well as styles of character
   have been replicated in famous works, for example Aragorn and Gandalf
   respectively from J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings trilogy. Character
   tropes are still commonly used in the realms of fiction and literature.
   They are viewed as incredibly important as they are able to depict
   particular aspects of human nature and life, thus constructing a sense
   of familiarity for readers or the audiences of a variety of media.
   Another reason attributing  to the perseverance of archetypes include
   linking the current text to established identities in other past works,
   therefore adding supplementary meaning to the text. Consequently, it is
   not exceptional to discover that numerous characters and plots resemble
   or overlap with that of Arthurian legends, which have served as models
   or inspiration for later works.

   Furthermore, Arthurian legends may be well-received due to the mystery
   involved. There is no definite storyline as Arthurian legends are
   pieced together from a number of different sources. There is no
   confirmation on which version is the original, adding to the intrigue
   revolving around the tales. Arthur’s birth and life have even become a
   point of research for historians, while some scholars claim that he is
   a Celtic deity- others assume that he was a real person of
   Romano-Briton origins. However, it is not only Arthur that is subjected
   to such ambiguity. The characters and settings surrounding him also
   vary in terms of their history and moral alignment. Take Morgan le Fay
   for example. She is portrayed as an evil sorceress in some versions but
   is shown as a benevolent healer who laid Arthur to rest at Avalon. As
   Arthurian legends are known to end on a cliffhanger (hence Arthur is
   known as the Once and Future King), it is generally agreed upon that
   the period of time in which he presumably ruled – the Golden Age, has
   passed while the true question of “when will he be back?” is left
   unanswered. The obscurity of the source material gives artists and
   creators the freedom to come up with their own versions of the
   characters and the story based on their own takes and perspectives. The
   temptations of filling in plot holes or exploring different parts of
   Arthurian legends may prove to be too alluring to withstand for
   storytellers. Apart from fiction, it is perhaps because we know so much
   yet so little of Arthurian legends that academic research on the very
   subject is still carried out today. As curator Dr ap Huw mentions, the
   appeal of Arthur is that he was or is “whoever you want him to be”.

   Sure, Arthurian legends may be popular, but at the possible expense of
   angering Arthurian scholars and fans, are the legends actually
   important? The answer to this is subjective and depends on the
   audience’s opinions. Still, it cannot be denied that the legends are
   classics that illustrate an important piece of history, no matter
   Arthur’s status as real or fiction. Like fairytales, they are a
   snapshot of how and what people’s beliefs were like at the time.
   Arthurian legends have also been proved to withstand the test of time
   from mediaeval to the modern era. As mentioned, they have been revamped
   a great number of times in the form of official published works to
   writings across fanfiction sites, although essentially all Arthur
   retellings are fanfiction of sorts. It has become a cultural work of
   considerable significance and its enduring popularity demonstrates that
   the legends are still fully capable of attracting a sizable audience,
   old, young and anywhere in between. The many adaptations of Arthurian
   legends in the fantasy genre like C.S. Lewis’ The Chronicles of Narnia
   and even George Lucas’ Star Wars, undoubtedly attest to the legends’
   influence. Not only have they been featured heavily in fiction and
   academia, aspects of it, namely Excalibur and mediaeval armour, have
   also made circles in the fashion world as seen in the form of Italian
   designer Alberta Ferretti’s limited edition collection inspired by King
   Arthur. There are also those who have dedicated their time and effort
   to uncovering the real life counterparts of the settings in which
   Arthurian legends take place. In particular, it has been widely
   hypothesised that Avalon could in actuality be Glastonbury or Isle of
   Man, though the lack of substantial evidence points Avalon to be a myth
   derived from early Celtic tales.

   The story of King Arthur dives into romance and chivalry. Historian
   Michael Woods suggests that King Arthur’s times was a “golden age of
   lost innocence”, hence forging a strong connection with people who long
   for a sense of dignity and justice that seem to only exist in myth. The
   diverse interpretations of Arthurian legends also bring to light
   different aspects of the tale, such as the contrasting portrayals of
   Morgan le Fay and how it possesses links to misogyny and the
   storyteller’s perspectives.  What do you think of when it comes to
   Arthurian legends? Is it the memorable characters, the beautiful
   settings or the weighty symbolism? Do you have any theories of when
   King Arthur will rise again? Arthurian legends can mean many things to
   many different people. They evolve according to its audience and their
   expectations as well as understanding of the stories. Even so, it is
   evident that Arthurian legends remain compelling in the minds of the
   people. As the BBC reports, “Romantics may hope that, one day, Arthur
   will return to rescue his people. But if he lives on through his
   legend, the ancient monarch, it would appear, has never really gone
   away”.
