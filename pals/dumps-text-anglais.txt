Arthur
2004The
real
King
Arthur
lived
in
the
late
5th
and
early
6th
century
He
was
a
warrior
chief
who
fought
against
the
AngloSaxons
and
probably
defeated
them
at
the
Battle
of
Badon
He
is
said
to
have
died
in
the
battle
of
Camlan
Stories
about
him
were
collected
in
the
12th
century
by
the
historian
Geoffrey
of
Monmouth
They
were
added
to
and
developed
by
French
writers
such
as
Chrétien
de
Troyes
who
wrote
during
the
period
117090
and
also
became
the
centre
of
a
group
of
legends
in
Germany
As
a
result
other
characters
such
as
Lancelot
Tristram
Tristan
and
Perceval
Parzival
became
associated
with
Arthur
and
were
included
by

the
version
of
the
legends
which
became
most
widely
known
in
BritainThe
stories
of
Arthur
and
his
knights
celebrate
the
age
of
chivalry
when
knights
aimed
to
live
according
to
the
highest
Christian
principles
Their
character
and
courage
are
tested
by
meetings
with
giants
dragons
and
sorcerers
and
by
their
own
human
weakness
such
as
pride
or
forbidden
love
The
love
affairs
of
Tristram
and
Isoud
Iseult
and
Sir
Lancelot
and
Guinevere
are
part
of
the
tradition
of
courtly
love
which
was
a
central
theme
in
European
poetry
of
the
Middle
AgesAccording
to
legend
Arthur
was
born
at
Tintagel
in
Cornwall
the
son
of
Uther
Pendragon
King
of
all
England
One
version
says
that
at
a
young
age
he
was
put
under
a
spell
by
the
magician
Merlin
so
that
he
grew
up
not
knowing
he
was
heir
to
the
English
throne
He
became
King
at
the
age
of
15
after
he
pulled
the
magic
sword
Excalibur
out
of
a
stone
when
all
the
other
knights
had
failed
to
do
so
Another
version
of
the
legend
says
that
he
received
the
sword
from
the
Lady
of
the
Lake
and
this
fits
in
with
the
story
that
as
he
was
dying
he
ordered
the
sword
to
be
thrown
back
into
the
lake
and
it
was
caught
by
a
hand
that
rose
from
the
water
Arthur
gathered
round
him
the
best
knights
in
the
land
including
Sir
Lancelot
Lancelots
son
Sir
Galahad
Sir
Bedivere
and
Sir
Gawain
and
established
his
court
at
Camelot
On
Arthurs
orders
the
knights
all
sat
at
the
Round
Table
so
nobody
could
sit
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
claim
to
be
more
important
than
the
restArthur
won
many
victories
in
battle
and
married
the
beautiful
Guinevere
Later
Arthurs
halfsister
the
sorceress
Morgan
le
Fay
attempted
to
kill
him
and
Arthurs
discovery
of
a
love
affair
between
his
wife
and
Sir
Lancelot
further
threatened
his
court
The
knights
went
off
in
search
of
the
Holy
Grail
Lancelot
saw
but
failed
to
obtain
it
because
he
was
not
pure
enough
and
it
was
eventually
found
by
Sir
Galahad
Arthur
went
to
fight
against
Rome
with
Sir
Gawain
but
while
he
was
abroad
his
sisters
son
Mordred
took
power
and
made
Guinevere
his
prisoner
Arthur
returned
to
England
to
defeat
and
kill
Mordred
at
the
battle
of
Camlan
but
was
himself
seriously
wounded
Morgan
le
Fay
then
appeared
in
a
boat
to
take
Arthur
to
Avalon
the
paradise
of
the
Celts
According
to
some
versions
Arthur
and
his
knights
now
lie
asleep
underground
waiting
for
the
day
they
are
needed
to
wake
and

In
this
1897
painting
of
Lady
Godiva
by
John
Collier
the
authentic
historical
person
is
fully
submerged
in
the
legend
presented
in
an
anachronistic
high
medieval
setting
A
legend
is
a
genre
of
folklore
that
consists
of
a
narrative
featuring
human
actions
believed
or
perceived
to
have
taken
place
in
human
history
Narratives
in
this
genre
may
demonstrate
human
values
and
possess
certain
qualities
that
give
the
tale
verisimilitude
Legend
for
its
active
and
passive
participants
may
include
miracles
Legends
may
be
transformed
over
time
to
keep
them
fresh
and
vital
Many
legends
operate
within
the
realm
of
uncertainty
never
being
entirely
believed
by
the
participants
but
also
never
being
resolutely
doubted1
Legends
are
sometimes
distinguished
from
myths
in
that
they
concern
human
beings
as
the
main
characters
and
do
not
necessarily
have
supernatural
origins
and
sometimes
in
that
they
have
some
sort
of
historical
basis
whereas
myths
generally
do
not23
The
Brothers
Grimm
defined
legend
as
folktale
historically
grounded4
A
byproduct
of
the
concern
with
human
beings
is
the
long
list
of
legendary
creatures
leaving
no
resolute
doubt
that
legends
are
historically
grounded
A
modern
folklorists
professional
definition
of
legend
was
proposed
by
Timothy
R
Tangherlini
in
19905
Legend
typically
is
a
short
mono
episodic
traditional
highly
ecotypified6
historicized
narrative
performed
in
a
conversational
mode
reflecting
on
a
psychological
level
a
symbolic
representation
of
folk
belief
and
collective
experiences
and
serving
as
a
reaffirmation
of
commonly
held
values
of
the
group
to
whose
tradition
it
belongs
Etymology
and
origin
edit
180pxHolgerdanskejpg
Holger
Danske
a
legendary
character
Legend
is
a
loanword
from
Old
French
that
entered
English
usage
c
1340
The
Old
French
noun
legende
derives
from
the
Medieval
Latin
legenda7
In
its
early
Englishlanguage
usage
the
word
indicated
a
narrative
of
an
event
The
word
legendary
was
originally
a
noun
introduced
in
the
1510s
meaning
a
collection
or
corpus
of
legends89
This
word
changed
to
legendry
and
legendary
became
the
adjectival
form8
By
1613
Englishspeaking
Protestants
began
to
use
the
word
when
they
wished
to
imply
that
an
event
especially
the
story
of
any
saint
not
acknowledged
in
John
Foxes
Actes
and
Monuments
was
fictitious
Thus
legend
gained
its
modern
connotations
of
undocumented
and
spurious
which
distinguish
it
from
the
meaning
of
chronicle10
In
1866
Jacob
Grimm
described
the
fairy
tale
as
poetic
legend
historic11
Early
scholars
such
as
Karl
Wehrhan
de12
Friedrich
Ranke13
and
Will
Erich
Peuckert14
followed
Grimms
example
in
focussing
solely
on
the
literary
narrative
an
approach
that
was
enriched
particularly
after
the
1960s15
by
addressing
questions
of
performance
and
the
anthropological
and
psychological
insights
provided
in
considering
legends
social
context
Questions
of
categorising
legends
in
hopes
of
compiling
a
contentbased
series
of
categories
on
the
line
of
the
AarneThompson
folktale
index
provoked
a
search
for
a
broader
new
synthesis
In
an
early
attempt
at
defining
some
basic
questions
operative
in
examining
folk
tales
Friedrich
Ranke
de
in
192516
characterised
the
folk
legend
as
a
popular
narrative
with
an
objectively
untrue
imaginary
content
a
dismissive
position
that
was
subsequently
largely
abandoned17
Compared
to
the
highly
structured
folktale
legend
is
comparatively
amorphous
Helmut
de
Boor
noted
in
192818
The
narrative
content
of
legend
is
in
realistic
mode
rather
than
the
wry
irony
of
folktale19
Wilhelm
Heiske20
remarked
on
the
similarity
of
motifs
in
legend
and
folktale
and
concluded
that
in
spite
of
its
realistic
mode
legend
is
not
more
historical
than
folktale
In
Einleitung
in
der
Geschichtswissenschaft
1928
Ernst
Bernheim
asserted
that
a
legend
is
simply
a
longstanding
rumour21
Gordon
Allport
credited
the
stayingpower
of
some
rumours
to
the
persistent
cultural
stateofmind
that
they
embody
and
capsulise22
thus
Urban
legends
are
a
feature
of
rumour23
When
Willian
Hugh
Jansen
suggested
that
legends
that
disappear
quickly
were
shortterm
legends
and
the
persistent
ones
be
termed
longterm
legends
the
distinction
between
legend
and
rumour
was
effectively
obliterated
Tangherlini
concluded24

Because

realism
are
called
fables
For
example
the
talking
animal
formula
of
Aesop
identifies
his
brief
stories
as
fables
and
not
legends
The
parable
of
the
Prodigal
Son
would
be
a
legend
if
it
were
told
as
having
actually
happened
to
a
specific
son
of
a
historical
father
If
it
included
a
donkey
that
gave
sage
advice
to
the
Prodigal
Son
it
would

Legenda
Aurea
or
The
Golden
Legend
comprises
a
series
of
vitae
or
instructive
biographical
narratives
tied
to
the
liturgical
calendar
of
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
They
are
presented
as
lives
of
the
saints
but
the
profusion
of
miraculous
happenings
and
above
all
their
uncritical
context
are
characteristics
of
hagiography
The
Legenda
was
intended
to
inspire
extemporized
homilies
and
sermons
appropriate
to
the
saint

Urban
legends
are
a
modern
genre
of
folklore
that
is
rooted
in
local
popular
culture
usually
comprising
fictional
stories
that
are
often
presented
as
true
with
macabre
or
humorous
elements
These
legends
can
be
used
for
entertainment
purposes
as
well
as
semiserious
explanations
for
seeminglymysterious
events
such
as
disappearances
and
strange
objects
The
term
urban
legend
as
generally
used
by
folklorists
has
appeared
in
print
since
at
least
196830
Jan
Harold
Brunvand
professor
of
English
at
the
University
of
Utah
introduced
the
term
to
the
general
public
in
a
series
of
popular
books
published
beginning
in
1981
Brunvand
used
his
collection
of
legends
The
Vanishing
Hitchhiker
American
Urban
Legends
Their
Meanings
1981
to
make
two
points
first
that
legends
and
folklore
do
not
occur
exclusively
in
socalled
primitive
or
traditional
societies
and
second
that
one
could
learn
much
about
urban
and
modern
culture
by
studying
such
tales

account
of
some
actually

personoften
a

Legends
are
sometimes
distinguished
from
myths
in
that
they
concern
human

rather
than

sometimes
in
that
they
have
some

of

do
not

and
King
Arthur
2004The
real
King
Arthur
lived
in
the
late
5th
and
early
6th
century
He
was
a
warrior
chief
who
fought
against
the
AngloSaxons
and
probably
defeated
them
at
the
Battle
of
Badon
He
is
said
to
have
died
in
the
battle
of
Camlan
Stories
about
him
were
collected
in
the
12th
century
by
the
historian
Geoffrey
of
Monmouth
They
were
added
to
and
developed
by
French
writers
such
as
Chrétien
de
Troyes
who
wrote
during
the
period
117090
and
also
became
the
centre
of
a
group
of
legends
in
Germany
As
a
result
other
characters
such
as
Lancelot
Tristram
Tristan
and
Perceval
Parzival
became
associated
with
Arthur
and
were
included
by
Malory
in
Le
Morte
DArthur
the
version
of
the
legends
which
became
most
widely
known
in
BritainThe
stories
of
Arthur
and
his
knights
celebrate
the
age
of
chivalry
when
knights
aimed
to
live
according
to
the
highest
Christian
principles
Their
character
and
courage
are
tested
by
meetings
with
giants
dragons
and
sorcerers
and
by
their
own
human
weakness
such
as
pride
or
forbidden
love
The
love
affairs
of
Tristram
and
Isoud
Iseult
and
Sir
Lancelot
and
Guinevere
are
part
of
the
tradition
of
courtly
love
which
was
a
central
theme
in
European
poetry
of
the
Middle
AgesAccording
to
legend
Arthur
was
born
at
Tintagel
in
Cornwall
the
son
of
Uther
Pendragon
King
of
all
England
One
version
says
that
at
a
young
age
he
was
put
under
a
spell
by
the
magician
Merlin
so
that
he
grew
up
not
knowing
he
was
heir
to
the
English
throne
He
became
King
at
the
age
of
15
after
he
pulled
the
magic
sword
Excalibur
out
of
a
stone
when
all
the
other
knights
had
failed
to
do
so
Another
version
of
the
legend
says
that
he
received
the
sword
from
the
Lady
of
the
Lake
and
this
fits
in
with
the
story
that
as
he
was
dying
he
ordered
the
sword
to
be
thrown
back
into
the
lake
and
it
was
caught

In
this
1897
painting
of
Lady
Godiva
by
John
Collier
the
authentic
historical
person
is
fully
submerged
in
the
legend
presented
in
an
anachronistic
high
medieval
setting
A
legend
is
a
genre
of
folklore
that
consists
of
a
narrative
featuring
human
actions
believed
or
perceived
to
have
taken
place
in
human
history
Narratives
in
this
genre
may
demonstrate
human
values
and
possess
certain
qualities
that
give
the
tale
verisimilitude
Legend
for
its
active
and
passive
participants
may
include
miracles
Legends
may
be
transformed
over
time
to
keep
them
fresh
and
vital
Many
legends
operate
within
the
realm
of
uncertainty
never
being
entirely
believed
by
the
participants
but
also
never
being
resolutely
doubted1
Legends
are
sometimes
distinguished
from
myths
in
that
they
concern
human
beings
as
the
main
characters
and
do
not
necessarily
have
supernatural
origins
and
sometimes
in
that
they
have
some
sort
of
historical
basis
whereas
myths
generally
do
not23
The
Brothers
Grimm
defined
legend
as
folktale
historically
grounded4
A
byproduct
of
the
concern
with
human
beings
is
the
long
list
of
legendary
creatures
leaving
no
resolute
doubt
that
legends
are
historically
grounded
A
modern
folklorists
professional
definition
of
legend
was
proposed
by
Timothy
R
Tangherlini
in
19905
Legend
typically
is
a
short
mono
episodic
traditional
highly
ecotypified6
historicized
narrative
performed
in
a
conversational
mode
reflecting
on
a
psychological
level
a
symbolic
representation
of
folk
belief
and
collective
experiences
and
serving
as
a
reaffirmation
of
commonly
held
values
of
the
group
to
whose
tradition
it
belongs
Etymology
and
origin
edit
180pxHolgerdanskejpg
Holger
Danske
a
legendary
character
Legend
is
a
loanword
from
Old
French
that
entered
English
usage
c
1340
The
Old
French
noun
legende
derives
from
the
Medieval
Latin
legenda7
In
its
early
Englishlanguage
usage
the
word
indicated
a
narrative
of
an
event
The
word
legendary
was
originally
a
noun
introduced
in
the
1510s
meaning
a
collection
or
corpus
of
legends89
This
word
changed
to
legendry
and
legendary
became
the
adjectival
form8
By
1613
Englishspeaking
Protestants
began
to
use
the
word
when
they
wished
to
imply
that
an
event
especially
the
story
of
any
saint
not
acknowledged
in
John
Foxes
Actes
and
Monuments
was
fictitious
Thus
legend
gained
its
modern
connotations
of
undocumented
and
spurious
which
distinguish
it
from
the
meaning
of
chronicle10
In
1866
Jacob
Grimm
described
the
fairy
tale
as
poetic
legend
historic11
Early
scholars
such
as
Karl
Wehrhan
de12
Friedrich
Ranke13
and
Will
Erich
Peuckert14
followed
Grimms
example
in
focussing
solely
on
the
literary
narrative
an
approach
that
was
enriched
particularly
after
the
1960s15
by
addressing
questions
of
performance
and
the
anthropological
and
psychological
insights
provided
in
considering
legends
social
context
Questions
of
categorising
legends
in
hopes
of
compiling
a
contentbased
series
of
categories
on
the
line
of
the
AarneThompson
folktale
index
provoked
a
search
for
a
broader
new
synthesis
In
an
early
attempt
at
defining
some
basic
questions
operative
in
examining
folk
tales
Friedrich
Ranke
de
in
192516
characterised
the
folk
legend
as
a
popular
narrative
with
an
objectively
untrue
imaginary
content
a
dismissive
position
that
was
subsequently
largely
abandoned17
Compared
to
the
highly
structured
folktale
legend
is
comparatively
amorphous
Helmut
de
Boor
noted
in
192818
The
narrative
content
of
legend
is
in
realistic
mode
rather
than
the
wry
irony
of
folktale19
Wilhelm
Heiske20
remarked
on
the
similarity
of
motifs
in
legend
and
folktale
and
concluded
that
in
spite
of
its
realistic
mode
legend
is
not
more
historical
than
folktale
In
Einleitung
in
der
Geschichtswissenschaft
1928
Ernst
Bernheim
asserted
that
a
legend
is
simply
a
longstanding
rumour21
Gordon
Allport
credited
the
stayingpower
of
some
rumours
to
the
persistent
cultural
stateofmind
that
they
embody
and
capsulise22
thus
Urban
legends
are
a
feature
of
rumour23
When
Willian
Hugh
Jansen
suggested
that
legends
that
disappear
quickly
were
shortterm
legends
and
the
persistent
ones
be
termed
longterm
legends
the
distinction
between
legend
and
rumour
was
effectively
obliterated
Tangherlini
concluded24

sense

things

on

accounts

Because

that

Urban
legends
are
a
modern
genre
of
folklore
that
is
rooted
in
local
popular
culture
usually
comprising
fictional
stories
that
are
often
presented
as
true
with
macabre
or
humorous
elements
These
legends
can
be
used
for
entertainment
purposes
as
well
as
semiserious
explanations
for
seeminglymysterious
events
such
as
disappearances
and
strange
objects
The
term
urban
legend
as
generally
used
by
folklorists
has
appeared
in
print
since
at
least
196830
Jan
Harold
Brunvand
professor
of
English
at
the
University
of
Utah
introduced
the
term
to
the
general
public
in
a
series
of
popular
books
published
beginning
in
1981
Brunvand
used
his
collection
of
legends
The
Vanishing
Hitchhiker
American
Urban
Legends
Their
Meanings
1981
to
make
two
points
first
that
legends
and
folklore
do
not
occur
exclusively
in
socalled
primitive
or
traditional
societies
and
second
that
one
could
learn
much
about
urban
and
modern
culture
by
studying
such
tales
