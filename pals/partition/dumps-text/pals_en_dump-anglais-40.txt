Ross
should
introduce

incident
We

and
other
commercial

In
November
Jackson
and
his
brothers
partnered
with
PepsiCo
in
a
million
promotional
deal
that
broke
records
for
a
celebrity
endorsement
equivalent
to

Jackson
helped

The

from
owning

rights
to

By

had
begun
buying

rights
to

songs
but
he
was
careful
with
his
acquisitions
only
bidding
on
a
few
of
the
dozens
that
were
offered
to
him

Jackson
s
early
acquisitions
of
music

copyrights
such
as
the
Sly

collection
included
Everyday
People
Len
Barry
s
and
Dion
DiMucci

In

announced
he
was
selling
the
ATV
Music
Publishing
catalog
comprising
the
publishing
rights
to
nearly
songs
including
most
of

material

offered
the
catalog
for

million
equivalent
to

Jackson
submitted
a
bid
of
million
equivalent
to

in
on
November


When
Jackson
and
McCartney
were
unable
to
make
a
joint
purchase
McCartney
did
not
want
to
be
the
sole
owner
of
the
Beatles
songs
and
did
not
pursue
an
offer
on
his
own

Jackson
s
agents
were
unable
to
come
to
a
deal
and
in
May
left
talks
after
having
spent
more
than
million
and
four
months
of
due
diligence
work
on
the
negotiations

In
June
Jackson
and
Branca
learned
that
Charles
Koppelman
s
and
Marty
Bandier
s
The
Entertainment
Company
had
made
a
tentative
offer
to
buy
ATV
Music
for
million
in
early
August
Holmes
Court
contacted
Jackson
and
talks
resumed

Jackson
s
increased
bid
of


million
equivalent
to
million
in
was
accepted
because
he
could
close
the
deal
more
quickly
having
already
completed
due
diligence

Jackson
agreed
to
visit
Holmes
Court
in
Australia
where
he
would

His
purchase
of

was

Increased
tabloid
speculation

Health
and
appearance
of
Michael
Jackson
Jackson
s
skin
had
been
medium
brown
during
his
youth
but
from
the
mid
s
gradually
grew
paler

The
change
drew
widespread
media
coverage
including
speculation
that
he
had
been
bleaching
his
skin

His
dermatologist
Arnold
Klein
said
he
observed
in
that
Jackson
had
vitiligo
a
condition
characterized
by
patches
of
the
skin
losing
their
pigment

He
also
identified
discoid
lupus
erythematosus
in
Jackson

He
diagnosed
Jackson
with
lupus
that
year
and
with
vitiligo
in


Vitiligo
s
drastic
effects
on
the
body
can
cause
psychological
distress

Jackson
used
fair
colored
makeup
and
possibly
skin
bleaching
prescription
creams
to
cover
up
the
uneven
blotches
of
color
caused
by
the
illness

The
creams
would
depigment
the
blotches
and
with
the
application
of
makeup
he
could
appear
very
pale

Jackson
said
he
had
not
purposely
bleached
his
skin
and
could
not
control
his
vitiligo
adding
When
people
make
up
stories
that
I
don
t
want
to
be
who
I
am
it
hurts
me

He
became
friends
with
Klein
and
Klein
s
assistant
Debbie
Rowe

Rowe
later
became
Jackson
s
second
wife
and
the
mother
of
his
first
two
children

In
his
autobiography
and
a
interview
Jackson
said
he
had
had
two
rhinoplasty
surgeries
and
a
cleft
chin
surgery
but
no
more
than
that

He
said
he
lost
weight
in
the
early
s
because
of
a
change
in
diet
to
achieve
a
dancer
s
body

Witnesses
reported
that
he
was
often
dizzy
and
speculated
he
was
suffering
from
anorexia
nervosa

Periods
of
weight
loss
became
a
recurring
problem
later
in
his
life

After
his
death
Jackson
s
mother
said
that
he
first
turned
to
cosmetic
procedures
to
remedy
his
vitiligo
because
he
did
not
want
to
look
like
a
spotted
cow


She
said
he
had
received
more
than
the
two
cosmetic
surgeries
he
claimed
and
speculated
that
he
had
become
addicted
to
them

In
it
was
reported
that
Jackson
slept
in
a
hyperbaric
oxygen
chamber
to
slow
aging

He
denied
the
story
although
it
was
alleged
that
Jackson
leaked
an
image
of
him
sleeping
in
a
glass
chamber
according
to
Jackson
this
was
a
promotional
shot
from
an
upcoming
space
opera
featuring
himself
to
The
National
Enquirer

It
was
also
reported
that
Jackson
took
female
hormone
shots
to
keep
his
voice
high
and
facial
hair
wispy
proposed
to
Elizabeth
Taylor
and
possibly
had
a
shrine
of
her
and
had
cosmetic
surgery
on
his
eyes

Jackson
s
manager
Frank
DiLeo
denied
all
of
them
except
for
Jackson
having
a
chamber

DiLeo
added
I
don
t
know
if
he
sleeps
in
it

I
m
not
for
it

But
Michael
thinks
it
s
something
that
s
probably
healthy
for
him

He
s
a
bit
of
a
health
fanatic

When
Jackson
took
his
pet
chimpanzee
Bubbles
to
tour
in
Japan
the
media
portrayed
Jackson
as
an
aspiring
Disney
cartoon
character
who
befriended
animals

It
was
also
reported
that
Jackson
had
offered
to
buy
the
bones
of
Joseph
Merrick
the
Elephant
Man


In
June
the
Chicago
Tribune
reported
Jackson
s
publicist
bidding
million
for
the
skeleton
to
the
London
Hospital
Medical
College
on
his
behalf

The
college
maintained
the
skeleton
was
not
for
sale

DiLeo
said
Jackson
had
an
absorbing
interest
in
Merrick
purely
based
on
his
awareness
of
the
ethical
medical
and
historical
significance

In
September
using
the
oxygen
chamber
story
the
British
tabloid
The
Sun
branded
Jackson
Wacko
Jacko
a
name
Jackson
came
to
despise

The
Atlantic
noted
that
the
name
Jacko
has
racist
connotations
as
it
originates
from
Jacko
Macacco
a
monkey
used
in
monkey
baiting
matches
at
the
Westminster
Pit
in
the
early
s
and
Jacko
was
used
in
Cockney
slang
to
refer
to
monkeys
in
general

Jackson
worked
with
George
Lucas
and
Francis
Ford
Coppola
on
the
minute
million
D
film
Captain
EO
which
ran
from
at
Disneyland
and
Epcot

later
at

been
removed
in
the
late
s
it
returned
to

park
for
several
years
after
Jackson
s
death

In
Ebony
reported
that
Jackson
had
disassociated
himself
from
the
Jehovah
s
Witnesses

Katherine
Jackson
said
this
might
have
been
because
some
Witnesses
strongly
opposed
the
Thriller
video
which
Michael
denounced
in
a
Witness
publication
in


In

an

he

Michael
Jackson
sexual
abuse
allegations
In
August
Jackson
was
accused
of
child
sexual
abuse
by
a
year
old
boy
Jordan
Chandler
and
his
father
Evan
Chandler

Jordan
said
he
and
Jackson
had
engaged
in
acts
of
kissing
masturbation
and
oral
sex

While
Jordan
s
mother
initially
told
police
that
she
did
not
believe
Jackson
had
molested
him
her
position
wavered
a
few
days
later

Evan
was
recorded
discussing
his
intention
to
pursue
charges
which
Jackson
used
to
argue
that
he
was
the
victim
of
a
jealous
father
trying
to
extort
money

Jackson
s
older
sister
La
Toya
accused
him
of
being
a
pedophile
she
later
retracted
this
saying
she
had
been
forced
into
it
by
her
abusive
husband

Police
raided
Jackson
s
home
in
August
and
found
two
legal
large
format
art
books
featuring
young
boys
playing
running
and
swimming
in
various
states
of
undress

Jackson
denied
knowing
of
the
books
content
and
claimed
if
they
were
there
someone
had
to
have
sent
them
to
him
and
he
did
not
open
them

Jordan
Chandler
gave
police
a
description
of
Jackson
s
genitals

A
strip
search
was
made
and
the
jurors
felt
the
description
was
not
a
match

In
January
Jackson
settled
with
the
Chandlers
out
of
court
for
a
reported
total
sum
of
million

The
police
never
pressed
criminal
charges

Citing
a
lack
of
evidence
without
Jordan
s
testimony
the
state
closed
its
investigation
on
September


Jackson
had
been
taking
painkillers
for
his
reconstructive
scalp
surgeries
administered
due
to
the
Pepsi
commercial
accident
in
and
became
dependent
on
them
to
cope
with
the
stress
of
the
sexual
abuse
allegations

On
November
Jackson
canceled
the
remainder
of
the
Dangerous
World
Tour
due
to
health
problems
stress
from
the
allegations
and
painkiller
addiction

He
thanked
his
close
friend
Elizabeth
Taylor
for
support
encouragement
and
counsel

The
end
of
the
tour
concluded
his
sponsorship
deal
with
Pepsi

In
late
Jackson
proposed
to
Lisa
Marie
Presley
the
daughter
of
Elvis
Presley
over
the
phone

They
were
married
in
La
Vega
Dominican
Republic
in
May
by
civil
judge
Hugo
Francisco
lvarez
P
rez

The
tabloid
media
speculated
that
the
wedding
was
a
publicity
stunt
to
deflect
away
from
Jackson
s
sexual
abuse
allegations
and
jump
start
Presley
s
career
as
a
singer

Their
marriage
ended
little
more
than
a
year
later
and
they
separated
in
December


Presley
cited
irreconcilable
differences
when
filing
for
divorce
the
next
month
and
only
sought
to
reclaim
her
maiden
name
as
her
settlement

After
the
divorce
Judge
P
rez
said
They
lasted
longer
than
I
thought
they
would

I
gave
them
a
year

They
lasted
a
year
and
a
half

Presley
later
said
she
and
Jackson
had
attempted
to
reconcile
intermittently
for
four
years
following
their
divorce
and
that
she
had
traveled
the
world
to
be
with
him

Jackson
composed
music
for
the
Sega
Genesis
video
game
Sonic
the
Hedgehog
but
left
the
project
around
the
time
the
sexual
abuse
allegations
surfaced
and
went
uncredited

The
Sega
Technical
Institute
director
Roger
Hector
and
the
Sonic
co
creator
Naoto
Ohshima
said
that
Jackson
s
involvement
was
terminated
and
his
music
reworked
following
the
allegations

However
Jackson
s
musical
director
Brad
Buxer
and
other
members
of
Jackson
s
team
said
Jackson
went
uncredited
because
he
was
unhappy
with
how
the
Genesis
replicated

Jackson
performed
at
Apollo
Theater

The
concert
was
a
fundraiser
for
the
Democratic
National
Committee
and
former
President
Bill
Clinton

The
money
collected
would
be
used
to
encourage
citizens
to
vote

It
raised


million

The
concert
was
called
Michael
Jackson
Live
at
the
Apollo
and
was
one
of
Jackson
s
final
on
stage
performances

In
July
at
Al
Sharpton
s
National
Action
Network
in
Harlem
Jackson
called
the
Sony
Music
chairman
Tommy
Mottola
a
racist
and
very
very
very
devilish
and
accused
him
of
exploiting
black
artists
for
his
own
gain

The
accusation
prompted
Sharpton
to
form
a
coalition
investigating
whether
Mottola
exploited
black
artists

Jackson
charged
that
Mottola
had
called
his
colleague
Irv
Gotti
a
fat
nigger


Sony
issued
a
statement
calling
the
accusations
ludicrous
spiteful
and
hurtful
and
said
Mottola
had
championed
Jackson
s
career
for
years

Sony
refused
to
renew
Jackson
s
contract
and
said
that
a
million
promotional
campaign
had
failed
because

refused

tour

Jackson
in

Beginning
in
May
a
documentary
film
crew
led
by
Martin
Bashir
followed
Jackson
for
several
months

The
documentary
broadcast
in
February
as
Living
with
Michael
Jackson
showed
Jackson
holding
hands
and
discussing
sleeping
arrangements
with
a
twelve
year
old
boy

He
said
that
he
saw
nothing
wrong
with
having
sleepovers
with
minors
and
sharing
his
bed
and
bedroom
with
various
people
which
aroused
controversy

He
insisted
that
the
sleepovers
were
not
sexual
and
that
his
words
had
been
misunderstood

In
October
Jackson
received
the
Key
to
the
City
of
Las
Vegas
from
Mayor
Oscar
Goodman

On
November
Sony
released

Santa
Barbara
authorities
charged
Jackson
with
seven
counts
of
child
molestation
and
two
counts
of
intoxicating
a
minor
with
alcoholic
drinks

Jackson
denied
the
allegations
and
pleaded
not
guilty

The
People
v

Jackson
trial
began
on
January
in
Santa
Maria
California
and
lasted
until
the
end
of
May

Jackson
found
the
experience
stressful
and
it
affected
his
health

If
convicted
he
would
have
faced
up
to
twenty
years
in
prison

On
June
Jackson
was
acquitted
on
all
counts

FBI
files
on
Jackson
released
in
revealed
the
FBI
s
role
in
the

Jackson
became
reclusive

In
June
he
moved
to
Bahrain
as
a
guest
of
Sheikh
Abdullah

In
early
it
was
announced
that
Jackson
had
signed
a
contract
with
a
Bahrain
startup
Two
Seas
Records

Nothing
came
of
the
deal
and
the
Two
Seas
CEO
Guy
Holmes
later
said
it
was
never
finalized

Holmes
also
found
that
Jackson
was
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
and
was
involved
in
ongoing
lawsuits

By
September
Jackson
was
no
longer
affiliated
with

Seas

In

Jackson
agreed
to
use
a

of
his
ATV
catalog
stake
then
worth
about

as
collateral
against
his
million
worth
of
loans
from

option
to
buy
half
of
his
stake
or
about
of

financial
managers
had
urged
him
to
shed
part
of
his
stake
to
avoid
bankruptcy

The

in
penalties

Jackson
and
Safechuck
in

In
choreographer
Wade
Robson
filed
a
lawsuit
alleging
that
Jackson
had
sexually
abused
him
for
seven
years
beginning
when
he
was
seven
years
old


In
a
case
was
filed
by
James
Safechuck
alleging
similar
sexual
abuse
over
a
four
year
period
starting
when
Safechuck
was
ten


Both
had
previously
testified
in
Jackson
s
defense
during
the
allegations
Robson
did
so
again
in


In
Robson
s
case
against
Jackson
s
estate
was
dismissed
as
it
had
been
filed
too
late

Safechuck
s
claim
was
also
time
barred

In
it
was
ruled
that
Jackson
s
corporations
could
not
be
held
accountable
for
his
alleged
past
actions

The
rulings
were
appealed

On
October
Safechuck
s
lawsuit
against
Jackson
s
corporations
was
again
dismissed

The
judge
ruled
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
Safechuck
had
had
a
relationship
with
Jackson
s
corporation
nor
was
it
proven
that
there
was
a
special
relationship
between
the
two

On
April
Robson
s
case
was
dismissed
because
of
a
lack
of
supporting
evidence
that
the
defendants
exercised
control
over
Jackson

Robson
and
Safechuck
s
allegations
were
the
subject
of
the
documentary
film
Leaving
Neverland
released
in
March


Radio
stations
in
New
Zealand
Canada
the
UK
and
the
Netherlands
removed
Jackson
s
music
from
their
playlists

Jackson
s
family
condemned
the
film
as
a
public
lynching
and
the
Jackson
estate
released
a
statement
calling
the
film
a
tabloid
character
assassination
Jackson
endured
in
life
and
now
in
death


Close
associates
of
Jackson
such
as
Corey
Feldman
Aaron
Carter
Brett
Barnes
and
Macaulay
Culkin
defended
Jackson
in
the
wake
of
the
documentary
s
release
saying
that
Jackson
had
never
molested
them

Documentaries
such
as
Square

Michael

Firsthand
Investigating
the
Michael

Documentary
and
Michael
Jackson
Chase
the
Truth
presented
information
countering
the
claims
suggested
by
Leaving

Jackson
s
album
sales
increased
following
the
documentary
screenings

Billboard
senior
editor
Gail
Mitchell
said
she
and
a
colleague
interviewed
about
thirty
music
executives
who
believed
Jackson
s
legacy
could
withstand
the
controversy

In
late
some
New
Zealand
and
Canadian
radio
stations
re
added
Jackson
s
music
to
their
playlists
citing
positive
listener
survey
results


On
February
the
Jackson
estate
sued
HBO
for
breaching
a
non
disparagement
clause
from
a
contract

The
suit
sought
to
compel
HBO
to
participate
in
a
non
confidential
arbitration
that
could
result
in
million
or
more
in
damages
awarded
to
the
estate

HBO
said
they
did
not
breach
a
contract
and
filed
an
anti
SLAPP
motion
against
the
estate

In
September
Judge
George
H

Wu
denied
HBO
s
motion
to
dismiss
the
case
allowing
the
Jackson
estate
to
arbitrate

HBO
appealed
but
in
December
the
appeals
court
affirmed
Wu
s
ruling

In
a
state
law
passed
in
California
which
granted
plaintiffs
in
child
sex
abuse
cases
an
additional
period
to
file
lawsuits

In
October
and
again
in
April
the
Los
Angeles
County
Superior
Court
ruled
that
MJJ
Productions
Inc

and
MJJ
Ventures
Inc

employees
were
not
legally
obligated
to
protect
the
two
men
from
Jackson

In
August
California
s
Second
District
Court
of
Appeal
overturned
the
ruling
and
the
case
was
approved
to
move
forward
to
trial

in
MTV
s
roster
and
steered
its
focus
from
rock
to
pop
music
and
R

leading
to
the
discontinuation
of
the

format
previously

Michael
Jackson
s
meteoric
rise
in
the
s
catapulted
him
to
global
stardom
and
his

In
Africa
his
influence
was
compared
to
Nelson
Mandela
for
his
ability
to
inspire
and
unite
diverse
audiences
through
his
music

Similarly
in
India
Jackson
was
likened
to
Mahatma
Gandhi
with
his
art
championing
themes
of
social
justice
and
humanitarianism
and
his
influence
extending
to
Bollywood
where
it
was
said
that
anyone
who
danced
well
was
compared
to
Michael
Jackson

In
Europe
Jackson
s
impact
was
compared
to
that
of
the
Pope
drawing
huge
crowds
of
people
who
gathered
to
see
the
singer
in
public
and
even
more
to
his
concerts
which
spread
messages
of
love
and
healing
during
rough
economic
and
political
times

His
presence
in
the
Middle
East
was
considered
as
widespread
as
Coca
Cola
symbolizing
a

global
culture
through
his
music

Jackson
is
considered
the
backbone
of
the
K
Pop
industry
in

Heal
the
World
Earth
Song
and
They
Don

dance
and
fashion
along
with
his

personal
life
made
him
a

for
over
four

Trying

Jackson
s
influence
on
the
pop
stars
that

him
is

commercial
success
that

to
which
he

breadth
of
Jackson

philanthropic
work
has

Artistry
Vocal

Jackson
was
known
as
an
expressive
vocalist
with
absolute
pitch

Critics
describe
his
vocal
theatricality
having
a
range
from
clear
and
soft
to
harsh
and
aggressive
depending
on
the
genre
sung

Principally
in
history
Michael
Jackson
is
the
sole
recipient
to
receive
Grammy

for
three
different

Bruce
Swedien
his
long
time
sound
engineer
emphasized
that
a
critical
element
of
their
vocal
recordings
are
of
him
and
Jackson
trying
numerous
approaches
to
rhythmic
emotional
and
technical
distinctions
to
consummate
a
sonic
character


His
stylings
such
as
common
use
of
staccato
legato
falsetto
as
well
as
vocal
hiccups
adlibs
wailings
and
growls
are
all
signature
to
his
sound

Jackson
sang
from
childhood
and
over
time
his
voice
and
vocal
style
changed

Between
and
his
voice
descended
from
boy
soprano
to
lyric
tenor

He
was
known
for
his
intonation
and
vocal
range

Through
each
music
release
his
vocal
development
and
changes
were
positively
narrated
by
music
journalists

With
the
arrival
of
Off
the
Wall
in
the
late
s
Jackson
s
abilities
in
his
coming
of
age
period
had
Rolling
Stone
comparing
his
vocals
to
the
breathless
dreamy
stutter
of
Stevie
Wonder
and
wrote
that
Jackson
s
feathery
timbred
tenor
is
extraordinarily
beautiful

It
slides
smoothly
into
a
startling
falsetto
that
s
used
very
daringly

By
the
time
of
s
Thriller
Rolling
Stone
wrote
that
Jackson
was
singing
in
a
fully
adult
voice
that
was
tinged
by
sadness


The
turn
of
the
s
saw
the
release
of
the
introspective
album
Dangerous

The
New
York
Times
noted
that
on
some
tracks
he
gulps
for
breath
his
voice
quivers
with
anxiety
or
drops
to
a
desperate
whisper
hissing
through
clenched
teeth
and
he
had
a
wretched
tone


When
singing
of
brotherhood
or
self
esteem
the
musician
would
return
to
smooth
vocals

Of
Invincible
Rolling
Stone
wrote
that
at
Jackson
still
performed
exquisitely
voiced
rhythm
tracks
and
vibrating
vocal
harmonies


Joseph
Vogel
notes
Jackson
s
ability
to
use
non
verbal
sounds
to
express
emotion

Neil
McCormick
wrote
that
Jackson
s
unorthodox
singing
style
was
original
and
utterly
distinctive


Influences
Jackson
was
influenced
by
musicians
including
James
Brown
Little
Richard
Jackie
Wilson
Diana
Ross
Fred
Astaire
Sammy
Davis
Jr

Gene
Kelly
and
David
Ruffin

Little
Richard
had
a
substantial
influence
on
Jackson
but
Brown
was
his
greatest
inspiration

When
Jackson
was
a
small
child
his
mother
would
wake
him
whenever
Brown
appeared
on
television

Jackson
described
being
mesmerized


Jackson
s
vocal
technique
was
influenced
by
Diana
Ross
his
use
of
the
oooh
interjection
from
a
young
age
was
something
Ross
had
used
on
many
of
her
songs
with
the
Supremes

She
was
a
mother
figure
to
him
and
he
often
watched
her
rehearse

He
said
he
had
learned
a
lot
from
watching
how
she
moved
and
sang
and
that
she
had
encouraged
him
to
have
confidence
in
himself

Choreographer
David
Winters
who
met
Jackson
while
choreographing
the
Diana
Ross
TV
special
Diana
said
that
Jackson
watched
the
musical
West
Side
Story
almost
every
week
and
it
was
his
favorite
film
he
paid
tribute
to
it
in
Beat
It
and
the
Bad
video

Musicianship
Jackson
had
no
formal
music
training
and
could
not
read
or
write
music
notation

He
is
credited
for
playing
guitar
keyboard
and
drums
but
was
not
proficient
in
them

When
composing
he
recorded
ideas
by
beatboxing
and
imitating
instruments
vocally

Describing
the
process
he
said
I
ll
just
sing
the
bass
part
into
the
tape
recorder

I
ll
take
that
bass
lick
and
put
the
chords
of
the
melody
over
the
bass
lick
and
that
s
what
inspires
the
melody

These
were
shown

where
he
vocalized
the
melody

as
well
as

by
overlaying

component

The
engineer
Robert
Hoffman
recalled
that
after
Jackson
came
in
with
a
song
he
had
written
overnight
Jackson
sang
every
note
of
every
chord
to
a
guitar
player

Hoffman
also
remembered
Jackson
singing
string
arrangements
part
by
part
into
a
cassette

Dance
Jackson
danced
from
a
young
age
as
part
of
the
Jackson
and
incorporated
dance
extensively
in
his
performances
and
music
videos

According
to
Sanjoy
Roy
of
The
Guardian
Jackson
would
flick
and
retract
his
limbs
like
switchblades
or
snap
out
of
a
tornado
spin
into
a
perfectly
poised
toe
stand


The
moonwalk
taught
to
him
by
Jeffrey
Daniel
was
Jackson
s
signature
dance
move
and
one
of
the
most
famous
of
the
th
century

Jackson
is
credited
for
coining
the
name
moonwalk
for
this
street
dance
move
previously
known
as
the
backslide


His
other
moves
included
the
robot
crotch
grab
and
the
anti

Steve
Huey
of

wrote
that
Thriller
refined
the
strengths
of
Off

Wall
the
dance
and
rock
tracks
were
more
aggressive
while
the
pop
tunes
and

were

Its
tracks
included
the

Jackson
s
vocabulary
of
grunts
squeals
hiccups
moans
and
asides
vividly
showed
his
maturation
into
an
adult
Robert
Christgau
wrote
in
Christgau
s
Record
Guide
Rock
Albums
of
the
Seventies


The
album
s
title
track
suggested
to
the
critic
a
parallel
between
Jackson
and
Stevie
Wonder
s
oddball
music
personas
Since
childhood
his
main
contact
with
the
real
world
has
been
on
stage
and
in
bed

With
Thriller
Christopher
Connelly
of
Rolling
Stone
commented
that
Jackson
developed
his
long
association
with
the
subliminal
theme
of
paranoia
and
darker
imagery

AllMusic
s
Stephen
Thomas
Erlewine
noted
this
on
the
songs
Billie
Jean
and
Wanna
Be
Startin
Somethin


In
Billie
Jean
Jackson
depicts
an
obsessive
fan
who
alleges
he
has
fathered
her
child
and
in
Wanna
Be
Startin
Somethin
he
argues
against
gossip
and
the
media

It
decried
gang
violence
in
a
homage
to
West
Side
Story
and
was
Jackson
s
first
successful
rock
cross
over
piece
according
to
Huey

He
observed
that
Thriller
began
Jackson
s
interest
with
the
theme
of
the
supernatural
a
topic
he
revisited
in
subsequent
years

In
Jackson
co
wrote
the
charity
anthem
We

humanitarian
themes
later
became
a
recurring
theme
in

is
seen
on
the
rock
song
Dirty

The
lead
single
I
Just
Can
t
Stop
Loving
You
is
a
traditional
love
ballad
and
Man
in
the
Mirror
is
a
ballad
of
confession
and
resolution

Smooth
Criminal
is
an
evocation
of
bloody
assault
rape
and
likely
murder

AllMusic
s
Stephen
Thomas
Erlewine
states
that
Dangerous
presents
Jackson
as
a
paradoxical
person

The
first
half
of
the
record
is
dedicated
to
new
jack
swing
including
songs
like
Jam
and
Remember

Time


It
was
the
first
Jackson
album
in
which
social
ills
became
a
primary
theme
Why
You
Wanna
Trip
on
Me
for
example
protests
world
hunger
AIDS
homelessness
and
drugs

Dangerous
contains
sexually
charged
songs
such
as
In
the
Closet


The
title
track
continues
the
theme
of
the
predatory
lover
and
compulsive
desire

The
second
half
includes
introspective
pop
gospel
anthems
such
as
Will
You
Be
There
Heal
the
World
and
Keep
the
Faith


In
the
ballad
Gone
Too
Soon
Jackson
gives
tribute
to
Ryan
White
and
the
plight
of
those
with
AIDS

HIStory
creates
an
atmosphere
of
paranoia

In
the
new
jack
swing
funk
rock
tracks
Scream
and
Tabloid
Junkie
and
the
R
B
ballad
You
Are
Not
Alone
Jackson
retaliates
against
the
injustice
and
isolation
he
feels
and
directs
his
anger
at
the
media

In
the
introspective
ballad
Stranger
in
Moscow
Jackson
laments
his
fall
from
grace
Earth
Song
Childhood
Little
Susie
and
Smile
are
operatic
pop
songs

In
D

Jackson
attacks

prosecuted
him

he
describes
Sneddon
as

The
zombie
themed
video
defined
music
videos
and
broke
racial
barriers
on
MTV
which
had
launched
two
years
earlier

Before
Thriller
Jackson
struggled
to
receive
coverage
on
MTV
allegedly
because
he
was
African
American

Pressure
from
CBS
Records
persuaded
MTV
to
start
showing
Billie
Jean
and
later
Beat
It
which
led
to
a
lengthy
partnership
with
Jackson
and
helped
other
black
music
artists
gain
recognition

The
popularity
of
his
videos
on
MTV
helped
the
relatively
new
channel
s
viewing
figures
and
MTV
s
focus
shifted
toward
pop
and
R
B

His
performance
on
Motown
Yesterday
Today
Forever
changed
the
scope
of
live
stage
shows
making
it
acceptable
for
artists
to
lip
sync
to
music
video
on

The
choreography

asked
by
Winfrey
in
the
interview
about
why
he
grabbed
his
crotch
he
said
it
was
spontaneously
compelled
by
the
music

Time

the
Bad
video
as
infamous

featured
Wesley
Snipes
Jackson
s
later

featured
famous
cameo
roles

For
the
Smooth
Criminal
video
Jackson
experimented
with
leaning
forward
at
a
degree
angle
beyond
the
performer
s
center
of
gravity

To
accomplish
this
live
Jackson
and
designers
developed
a
special
shoe
to
lock
the
performer
s
feet
to
the
stage
allowing
them
to
lean
forward

They
were
granted
U

for
the
device

In
he
left
the
Jehovah
s
Witnesses

There
was
strong
opposition
to
his
Thriller
video
on
the
part
of
some
Witnesses

Perhaps
the
controversy
figured
into
his
decision
to
leave

But
I
don
t
know
that
for
a
fact
because
I
didn
t
talk
to
him
about
what
he
d
done

I
couldn
t

Witnesses
do
not
discuss
spiritual
matters
with
a
person
who
has
disassociated
himself
from
the
Witnesses
including
family
members

But
I
want
to
stress
that
contrary
to
published
reports
I
was
not
required
to
shun
my
son

Our
relationship
is
as
loving
today
as
it
was
when
he
was

I
just
can

He

Retrieved

I
don
t
think
MJ
knew
just
how
much
his
music
shaped
a
whole
generation
of
Arabs
just
how
many
fans
he
had
here
and
just
how
devoted
they
remained
throughout
his
ordeals

We
might
not
have
heard
of
the
Beatles
or
Elvis
Presley
but
we
sure
knew
Michael
Jackson

There
were
fears
among
the
religious
police
about
his
influence
on
the
young
mind
he
was
a
symbol
of
America
as
a
land
of
opportunity
especially
for
a
generation
of
Arabs
that
had
grown
up
in

named
their

after
him
