fictional
Pendleton
University

a
rash

being
committed
years
after

The

all
resemble
different
urban
legends

College
s
G
Building
was
the
site
of
Stanley
Hall
where
a
bloody
massacre
took
place
years
prior

Early
in
the
movie
Natalie
Alicia
Witt
and
Brenda
Rebecca
Gayheart
talk
about
the
legend
of
the
Stanley
Hall
massacre
and
dare
one
another
to
stand
in
the
doorway
under
the
arch
on
the
east
side
of
the
building
and
repeat
the
words
Bloody
Mary
three
times

They
jump
when
they
hear
moaning
coming
up
from
the
boarded
up
door

Towards
the
end
of
the
film
Natalie
Alicia
Witt
hears
screaming
coming
from
Stanley
Hall
and
climbs
the
south
eastern
exterior
of
the
building

She
and
Paul
Jared
Leto
then
confront
Brenda
Rebecca
Gayheart
an
argument
which
results
in
Brenda
falling
out
the
second
floor
window
over
the
archway
of
G
Building
s
east
entrance

When
the
film
was
in
production

was

The
former
residence
of
the
Superintendent
of
the
Lakeshore
Psychiatric
Hospital
today
known
as
Cumberland
House
served
as
the
fraternity
house
in
Urban

where
a
Halloween
party
is
held

Fun
Trivia
Urban
Legend
was
released
only
two
years
after
the
first
of
the
Scream
trilogy
films
and
received
much
negative
criticism
when
the
two
were
compared

Both
films
feature
a
well
known
group
of
young
actors
playing
a
small
group
of
friends
who
are
overly
familiar
with
the
horror
movie
genre
and
find
themselves
at
the
center
of
a
series
of
bizarre
murders

Like
its
counterpart
Urban
Legend
did
not
hesitate
to
poke
fun
at
itself
Just
prior
to
his
death
Damon
Joshua
Jackson
turns
on
the
radio
in
the
car
the
song
playing
is
the
soundtrack
to
his
hit
TV
show
Dawson
s
Creek
Paul
Cole
s
I
Don
t
Want
to
Wait


At
the
end
of
the
film
a
group
of
students
sit
around
talking
about
the
murders
and
debate
whether
or
not
they
are
an
urban
legend

One
of
the
students
jokingly
says
that
they
bet
Brenda
was
the
girl
from
the
Noxzema
commercials
which
Rebecca
Gayheart
starred
in

When
Paul
Jared
Leto
and
Natalie
Alicia
Witt
break
into
Professor
Wexler
s
Robert
Englund
office
they
spot
a
Freddy
Kruger
puppet
Englund
played
Kruger
in
A
Nightmare
on
Elm
Street
