Fascinating
Myths
in
Iceland
Landmannalaugar
in
the
Highlands
of
Iceland

A
Comprehensive
Guide
to
Icelandic
Folklore
Legends
In
a
realm
where
fiery
volcanoes
clash
with
icy
glaciers
and
the
Northern
Lights
illuminate
the
winter
sky
Iceland
is
a
place
where
the
boundaries
between
the
natural
and
the
supernatural
blur

This
remote
island
forged
by
the
raw
power
of
nature
is
steeped
in
legends
that
echo
with
the
whispers
of
ancient
gods
elusive
elves
and
fearsome
trolls

Here
the
winds
carry
folktales
of
hidden
worlds
beneath
the
earth
where
creatures
of
myths
and
legend
dwell

Join
us
as
we
delve
into
the
mystical
narratives
at
the
heart
of
this
Nordic
land

Lagarflj
tsormur
the
Icelandic
Loch
Ness
monster
Deep
in
the
waters
of
Lake
Lagarfljot
in
East
Iceland
lies
the
beast
Lagarflj
tsormur
the
Lagarfljot
worm
similar
to
Scotland
s
Loch
Ness
monster

Legend
has
it
that
a
young
girl
once
asked
her
mother
how
to
make
the
most
of
the
gold
ring
she
gave
her

The
mother
told
the
daughter
a
myth
according
to
which
gold
can
grow
on
a
worm

So
the
young
girl
trapped
a
worm
alongside
her
gold
ring
in
a
chest

But
alas
it
was
the
worm
that
grew
bigger
instead

Scared
she
threw
the
chest
into
the
lake
making
it
the
monster
s
home
for
eternity

The
legend
stems
from
the
eerie
atmosphere
around
the
lake

Of
late
its
existence
has
been
alluded
to
on
the
Internet
through
videos
showing
a
moving
form
in
Lake
Lagarfljot

The
Trolls
of
V
k
The
rocky
mountains
of
the
Icelandic
Highlands
are
home
to
big
stupid
and
greedy
trolls
a
prominent
character
in
Icelandic
folklore

Although
not
physically
appealing
trolls
can
perform
extraordinary
magical
feats
including
fearsome
spells
and
enchantments


As
they
aren
t
the
most
clever
beings
humans
can
easily
free
themselves
of
their
enchantments

That
being
said
trolls
have
a
taste
for
flesh
and
often
lure
unsuspecting
humans
including
misbehaving
children
into
their
caves
through
spells
potions
or
simply
by
capturing
them

The
Reynisdrangar
cliffs
three
towering
rocks
off
the
beach
of
Reynisfjara
V
k
M
rdal
are
a
testament
to
the
Icelandic
legend
of
trolls
turning
to
stone
in
the
sun

Hvitserkur
or
the
troll
rock
in
Iceland

The
lfh
l
Dollhouses
No
matter
where
you
find
yourself
in
Iceland
whether
amidst
the
bustle
of
a
lively
town
or
deep
within
the
enchanting
embrace
of
its
otherworldly
landscapes
you
are
likely
to
encounter
lfh
l

These
miniature
wooden
dwellings
lovingly
crafted
by
human
hands
stand
as
humble
abodes
for
the
elves
who
are
believed
to
inhabit
them

lfh
l
dollhouses
can
range
from
the
simplest
to
the
most
elaborate
and
include
minute
churches
created
to
convert
the
elves
to
Christianity

Hulduf
lk
the
Elves
of
Iceland
North
European
and
Germanic
mythology
refer
to
elves
as
beautiful
subtle
eternal
beings
having
extraordinary
magical
power

In
Iceland
elves
are
called
Hulduf
lk
hidden
people
as
they
live
in
enchanted
rocks
and
cliffs

Their
resemblance
to
humans
and
their
lifestyle
is
remarkably
uncanny
and
believed
to
be
why
they
are
invisible
most
of
the
time
except
for
occasions
like
Midsummer
Night
and
New
Year
s
Eve

Icelandic
elves
are
fiercely
protective
of
their
enchanted
homes
and
are
known
to
unleash
great
harm
on
those
who
disturb
them

The
latest
manifestation
of
this
myth
occurred
during
a
road
laying
project
at
the
G
lgahraun
lava
field
in


Mysterious
breakdowns
and
strange
accidents
plagued
the
project
until
at
last
the
road
was
rerouted
to
bypass
the
hidden
people
s
realm
leaving
their
secrets
undisturbed

Iceland
s
Yule
Lads
In
Iceland
the
holiday
season
doesn
t
start
until
Yule
Lads
or
rather
the
first
of
these
thirteen
mischievous
creatures
have
made
their
appearance

These
thirteen
brothers
who
trace
their
lineage
back
to
trolls
inhabit
the
pitch
black
caves
within
the
mountains
sharing
their
home
with
their
ogre
parents
Gr
la
and
Leppal
i
and
the
child
eating
Yule
Cat

Their
tradition
of
creating
mischief
in
rural
communities
led
them
to
be
called
names
such
as
The
Door
Slammer
and
Candle
Stealer


Today
these
Yule
Lads
have
taken
on
a
new
role
as
the
Icelandic
version
of
Santa
Claus
