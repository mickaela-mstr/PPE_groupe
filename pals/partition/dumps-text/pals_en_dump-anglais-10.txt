You
know
The
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollow
from
the
countless
movies
cartoons
and
other
adaptations

The
tale
of
Rip
Van
Winkle
is
thoroughly
ingrained
in
American
culture

But
how
about
the
man
behind
the
stories
As
it
turns
out
Washington
Irving
s
life
was
just
as
interesting
as
the
books
he
wrote

Here
are
things
you
might
not
know
about
America
s
first
international
best
selling
author



Irving
was
the
last
of
children
eight
of
whom
lived
into
adulthood

His
older
brothers
often
supported
him
as
he
pursued
his
writing
interests
and
he
started
the
literary
magazine
Salmagundi
with
his
brother
William



He
was
named
after
George
Washington

Irving
was
born
in
the
same
year
the
American
Revolution
came
to
an
end

He
was
named
after
the
war
hero
and
attended
Washington
s
inauguration
when
he
was
years
old

In
fact
historians
think
that
Irving
s
account
of
Washington
s
swearing
in
created
the
now
challenged
story
that
Washington
added
So
help
me
God
to
his
oath
of
office



In
yellow
fever
had
reached
epidemic
proportions
in
New
York
with
over
deaths

Fear
of
the
disease
drove
the
family
to
send
Irving
to
stay
with
a
friend
in
Tarrytown

It
was
here
that
he
would
have
gotten
to
know
Sleepy
Hollow
which
was
to
become
the
setting
of
course
of
his
most
famous
story
The
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollow



As
a
reporter
for
his
brother
Peter
s
newspaper
The
Morning
Chronicle
Irving
covered
Aaron
Burr
s
treason
trial

He
described
the
courtroom
meeting
of
Burr
and
his
adversary
General
James
Wilkinson
saying
Burr
turned
his
head
looked
him
full
in
the
face
with
one
of
his
piercing
regards
swept
his
eye
over
his
whole
person
from
head
to
foot
as
if
to
scan
his
dimensions
then
coolly
resumed
his
former
position



He
was
engaged
to
Matilda
Hoffman
in
but
she
died
of
tuberculosis
before
they
were
wed

Irving
was
devastated
and
never
married

Years
later
he
wrote
to
a
friend
about
her
death
saying
For
years
I
could
not
talk
on
the
subject
of
this
hopeless
regret
I
could
not
even
mention
her
name
but
her
image
was
continually
before
me
and
I
dreamt
of
her
incessantly



Irving
not
only
coined
the
word
Gotham
as
a
nickname
for
New
York
City
he
also
helped
establish
the
use
of
knickerbocker
as
a
name
for
New
Yorkers

Gotham
was
the
name
of
the
city
lampooned
in
stories
is
his
literary
magazine

Knickerbocker
was
adapted
from
his
book
A
History
of
New
York
From
the
Beginning
of
the
World
to
the
End
of
the
Dutch
Dynasty
by
Diederich
Knickerbocker

Irving
was
also
the
origin
of
the
phrase
the
almighty
dollar
having
written
in
The
Creole
Village
The
almighty
dollar
that
great
object
of
universal
devotion
throughout
our
land
seems
to
have
no
genuine
devotees
in
these
peculiar
villages
and
unless
some
of
its
missionaries
penetrate
there
and
erect
banking
houses
and
other
pious
shrines
there
is
no
knowing
how
long
the
inhabitants
may
remain
in
their
present
state
of
contented
poverty



It
wouldn
t
be
a
very
merry
Christmas
without
Irving

In
a
time
when
Christmas
wasn
t
widely
celebrated
Irving
helped
create
the
modern
image
of
Santa
Claus
in
A
History
of
New
York

He
wrote
about
a
man
who
dreamt
that
the
good
St

Nicholas
came
riding
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
in
that
self
same
wagon
wherein
he
brings
his
yearly
presents
to
children

He
continued
to
foster
the
Christmas
tradition
in
The
Sketch
Book
of
Geoffrey
Crayon
Gent

with
stories
like
Christmas
Eve
which
describes
the
then
little
known
tradition
of
hanging
mistletoe



Irving
also
had
a
hand
in
inventing
the
myth
that
people
in
the
Middle
Ages
thought
the
world
was
flat

In
Irving
s
book
A
History
of
the
Life
and
Voyages
of
Christopher
Columbus
he
fictionalizes
the
meeting
of
the
Spanish
commission
that
examines
Columbus
expedition
plan
with
members
of
the
committee
raising
objections
to
the
idea
that
world
was
round

Readers
accepted
Irving
s
version
as
truth
but
in
reality
the
educated
class
would
have
long
accepted
the
idea
of
a
round
earth



He
bought
his
riverside
home
Sunnyside
in
for
and
he
died
of
a
heart
attack
in
his
bedroom
in


The
home
was
quite
the
tourist
attraction
with
Oliver
Wendell
Holmes
Sr

writing
that
Sunnyside
was
next
to
Mount
Vernon
the
best
known
and
most
cherished
of
all
the
dwellings
in
our
land



In
Irving
was
the
first
author
to
be
featured
on
the
Famous
Americans
series
stamps

Other
authors
included
in
the
series
were
James
Fenimore
Cooper
Ralph
Waldo
Emerson
Louisa
May
Alcott
and
Samuel
Clemens
