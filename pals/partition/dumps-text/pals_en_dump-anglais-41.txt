Folklore
and
local
colour
There
is
a
story
that
when
Alexandre
Dumas
play
Christine
was
banned
shortly
before
the
Revolution
Dumas
went
to
plead
his
case
to
the
acad
micien
and
censor
Charles
Brifaut

Brifaut
suggested
what
seemed
to
him
minor
alterations
such
as
the
sex
of
the
protagonist
and
mentioned
that
under
the
First
Empire
he
had
been
obliged
to
do
much
the
same

A
play
of
his
set
in
Spain
was
considered
too
inflammatory
given
the
Emperor
s
difficulties
in
that
country
so
he
changed
some
names
and
locations
and
transformed
it
into
Ninus
II
an
acceptable
drama
of
ancient
Babylon

Dumas
exclaimed
But
really
Monsieur
Brifaut
the
local
colour
Brifaut
smiled
and
replied
Monsieur
in
our
time
for
us
local
colour
had
not
yet
been
invented

Brifaut
s
cynicism
is
echoed
by
many
contemporary
historians

Dumas
was
shocked
because
Brifaut
had
in
his
opinion
sacrificed
the
authenticity
of
the
work
what
was
true
of
Spain
could
not
also
be
true
of
Babylon

But
for
post
modern
historians
trained
to
unpick
invented
traditions
and
imagined
communities
the
Romantics
yearning
for
authenticity
has
itself
become
suspect

The
whole
nineteenth
century
enterprise
of
defining
cultural
difference
through
nation
building
imperial
exploration
and
social
investigation
can
be
seen
in
retrospect
as
a
fabrication
in
which
the
self
serving
taxonomies
of
elites
were
imposed
on
suspect
data

The
academic
subjects
built
on
this
concern
for
explaining
difference
history
sociology
and
anthropology
have
likewise
had
their
credentials
as
social
sciences
severely
weakened

But
the
subject
which
has
suffered
most
by
the
retreat
into
reflexivity
is
folklore

Pioneer
sociologists
and
anthropologists
may
have
been
keen
to
collect
and
classify
but
from
the
start
folklorists
saw
themselves
in
a
more
active
role
reviving
threatened
traditions

The
issue
of
authenticity
was
always
therefore
of
greater
significance
to
folklore

For
romantics
like
Dumas
an
enthusiastic
reader
and
translator
of
the
Grimms
folklore
was
all
about
local
colour

The
subject
had
been
born
out
of
an
assertion
of
cultural
difference
in
reaction
to
the
universalist
ambitions
of
the
Enlightenment

Johann
Gottfried
Herder
put
its
case
most
clearly
what
was
true
and
good
for
France
was
alien
to
Germany
for
each
nation
had
over
centuries
developed
its
own
unique
traditions
ideally
suited
to
the
character
of
its
people

The
essence
of
this
unique
culture
what
Herder
called
the
folk
soul
was
expressed
in
language
and
in
particular
in
folk
song
and
tale

No
one
person
could
claim
authorship
of
ballads
they
were
the
communal
almost
unconscious
creation
of
the
nation
as
a
whole

Every
singer
was
connected
to
the
collective
body
of
the
nation
and
simultaneously
to
their
ancestors
from
whom
they
had
inherited
this
traditional
lore

This
is
a
well
known
story
but
there
is
one
point
that
I
would
like
to
emphasise

Herder
believed
that
the
origins
of
cultural
difference
lay
in
the
environment
Nature
has
sketched
with
the
mountain
ranges
she
formed
and
with
the
rivers
she
made
flow
from
them
the
rough
but
definite
outline
of
the
entire
history
of
man
Oceans
mountain
chains
and
rivers
are
the
most
natural
boundaries
not
only
of
lands
but
also
of
peoples
customs
languages
and
empires

The
customs
of
each
nation
had
been
shaped
by
the
landscape
in
which
they
lived

Folklore
was
not
just
the
expression
of
a
people
and
its
history
but
of
the
land
itself

Thus
the
Grimms
were
able
to
describe
the
tales
collected
from
their
their
principal
informants
Dorothea
Viehmann
the
so
called
M
rchenfrau
of
Niederzwehren
and
Old
Marie
as
authentically
Hessian
and
originally
Hessian


Emile
Souvestre
a
romantic
poet
and
one
of
the
earliest
imitators
of
the
Grimms
in
France
expressed
this
connection
between
story
and
geography
in
an
environmental
clich
when
introducing
his
collection
Le
Foyer
breton
we
have
only
published
those
folktales
which
exhale
that
smell
of
the
land
which
cannot
be
imitated

More
than
a
hundred
years
later
the
compiler
of
the
French
folktale
index
Paul
Delarue
echoed
this
sentiment
in
France
as
in
the
other
countries
folktales
have
through
the
course
of
the
centuries
been
subjected
to
the
influence
of
the
physical
and
human
environment
of
the
particular
genius
of
the
race
and
they
have
acquired
characteristics
that
are
unique

These
unique
characteristics
might
be
obvious
to
collectors
able
to
compare
and
contrast
the
narrative
tradition
of
many
communities
but
it
is
questionable
whether
they
could
have
been
identified
by
the
narrators
of
folktales

Folklorists
seldom
asked
their
informants
where
they
thought
their
stories
originated
but
Ariane
de
F
lice
who
conducted
fieldwork
in
the
marshland
of
the
Loire
estuary
after
the
Second
World
War
was
the
exception

She
was
told
They
must
have
been
more
intelligent
than
most
the
guys
who
invented
this
You
won
t
find
that
here

They
come
perhaps
from
the
depths
of
England
or
I
don
t
know
where

Their
exotic
quality
was
indeed
part
of
the
tales
attraction

None
of
her
narrators
who
all
came
from
the
one
village
suggested
that
there
was
anything
particularly
Breton
about
their
tales
and
yet
F
lice
s
book
was
entitled
Contes
de
Haute
Bretagne

To
this
day
it
is
almost
impossible
to
find
a
folktale
collection
which
does
not
claim
to
be
in
some
way
expressive
of
a
region
or
nation

The
primacy
of
collective
identities
be
they
ethnic
cultural
or
geographic
is
the
legacy
bequeathed
by
romantic
nationalism
to
folklore

Folk
wisdom
however
recognised
the
ease
with
which
songs
and
stories
were
diffused
around
the
globe
and
this
has
been
understood
at
a
scholarly
level
also

Delarue
catalogued
the
French
folktales
according
to
the
international
index
of
tale
types

The
tale
of
Cinderella
is
tale
type
and
one
can
go
to
the
folktale
catalogue
of
any
country
from
China
to
the
Caribbean
and
find
examples
of
tales
that
fit
this
typology

The
story
was
popular
in
France
but
not
specific
to
France

The
same
is
true
of
other
genres
of
folklore
whether
we
are
talking
of
riddles
proverbs
legends
or
folksongs
it
is
difficult
to
find
examples
limited
to
just
one
region
or
one
nation

They
all
have
analogues
in
other
countries

Delarue
knew
this
his
argument
was
that
the
way
Cinderella
was
told
in
France
was
characteristically
French

For
example
it
lacked
the
cruelty
and
overt
moralising
that
he
associated
with
German
tales

And
it
is
true
that
while
Cinderella
was
moreorless
universally
known
the
tale
was
never
told
exactly
the
same
way
in
different
places

But
was
this
variation
a
reflection
of
national
or
regional
cultural
difference
or
did
it
have
more
to
do
with
the
sex
of
the
narrators
their
occupations
and
personalities
or
the
personalities
of
the
collectors
This
last
is
the
most
serious
charge
for
it
threatens
not
only
to
deny
folklore
s
claims
to
reveal
specific
cultures
but
to
undermine
the
entire
collecting
project

What
if
folklorists
as
collectors
and
editors
shaped
the
final
work
to
fit
ideological
agendas
of
their
own
This
is
indeed
the
accusation
levelled
at
Emile
Souvestre
and
even
more
so
at
his
contemporary
Th
odore
Hersart
de
la
Villemarqu


The
publication
in
of
Villemarqu
s
Barzaz
Breiz
Breton
Ballads
had
an
impact
in
France
akin
to
MacPherson
s
Ossian

Unfortunately
there
were
other
parallels

Villemarqu
was
a
Breton
patriot
who
wanted
to
endow
his
homeland
with
an
epic
literature
to
rival
that
of
any
nation

He
was
also
an
aristocrat
a
conservative
and
a
Catholic
and
the
Breton
nation
he
envisioned
was
pious
deferential
and
static
preserved
by
its
language
and
traditions
from
the
taint
of
revolutionary
modernity

The
ballads
he
discovered
suited
all
these
purposes
admirably

Although
he
styled
himself
as
the
collector
and
translator
of
the
Breton
ballads
the
suspicion
arose
that
he
was
in
fact
their
author

The
Querelle
over
the
authenticity
of
the
Barzaz
Breiz
which
irrupted
in
continues
to
rumble
on
but
a
prevailing
albeit
erroneous
judgement
in
academic
circles
is
that
Villemarqu
s
ballads
like
MacPherson
s
fragments
were
forgeries

Villemarqu
is
not
the
only
nineteenth
century
folklorist
to
fall
under
the
critical
spot
light
not
least
because
many
French
folklorists
were
likewise
aligned
with
the
Catholic
Royalist
right

Their
desire
to
establish
a
connection
between
the
land
and
its
people
through
its
folklore
has
been
seen
as
a
defensive
ploy
by
traditional
elites
landowners
and
clerics
in
the
face
of
rural
depopulation
social
mobility
and
radical
political
upheaval

It
is
not
just
that
folklorists
were
local
patriots
with
regionalist
or
autonomist
objectives
though
many
were
but
it
is
also
a
question
of
the
kind
of
country
or
region
they
were
patriotic
about

Why
in
France
for
example
did
practically
every
folklorist
reject
the
administrative
boundaries
created
by
the
Revolution
the
departments
in
favour
of
collecting
the
folklore
of
the
Old
Regime
provinces
such
as
Lorraine
Franche
Comt
Normandy
The
implicit
or
explicit
explanation
is
that
the
provinces
represented
genuine
cultural
units
but
there
is
sometimes
at
least
the
hint
of
counter
revolutionary
nostalgia

Folklorists
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
claimed
that
theirs
was
an
objective
science
with
its
own
vigorous
methodology

But
the
suspicion
among
academics
today
is
that
folklore
was
less
the
creation
of
the
folk
than
the
imposition
derived
from
political
and
aesthetic
movements
among
d
racin
intellectuals

The
implications
of
such
revisionism
are
not
limited
to
folklore

With
the
development
of
social
history
since
the
s
historians
have
mined
folklore
collections
to
uncover
the
hidden
lives
of
the
popular
classes
developing
such
explanatory
schemas
as
popular
religion
popular
medicine
and
popular
culture

Yet
recently
all
these
categories
have
been
dismissed
as
constructions
derived
from
the
discourses
of
nineteenth
century
elites

Even
the
very
concept
of
peasant
has
been
called
into
question

What
for
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
has
been
the
most
influential
approach
to
nineteenth
century
rural
France
Eugen
Weber
s
history
of
the
acculturation
of
regional
and
traditional
societies
in
the
process
of
transforming
Peasants
into
Frenchmen
crumbles
if
the
very
categories
of
peasant
tradition
and
region
were
nothing
more
than
the
ideological
projections
of
nation
builders

As
a
consequence
the
peasants
who
seemed
to
speak
to
us
from
the
pages
of
folklore
collections
have
been
once
more
condemned
to
historical
marginality
for
their
voices
will
always
be
hidden
behind
the
discourses
of
the
dominant

I
am
unwilling
to
accept
this
conclusion
and
the
remainder
of
this
paper
will
attempt
to
show
that
nineteenth
century
folklorists
were
basically
correct
in
proposing
a
connection
between
cultural
traditions
and
a
particular
community
and
that
the
relationship
between
the
land
and
the
lore
was
suggested
to
them
by
their
informants
rather
than
imposed
on
them

This
does
not
mean
that
I
think
folklorists
always
correctly
identified
what
that
connection
was
and
in
the
case
of
France
the
largely
unreflecting
use
of
pre
revolutionary
provincial
titles
is
unhelpful

But
mislabelling
should
not
prevent
us
realising
what
folklorists
intuitively
grasped
that
there
was
a
link
between
the
stories
they
heard
and
the
landscapes
in
which
they
were
told

To
demonstrate
this
I
will
call
on
the
collection
made
by
Paul
S
billot
between
and
in
and
around
the
village
of
Saint
Cast
near
to
Saint
Malo
on
the
north
Breton
coast

Paul
S
billot
and
the
storytellers
of
Saint
Cast
Although
Paul
S
billot
was
the
dominant
figure
in
French
folklore
studies
at
the
end
the
nineteenth
century
he
did
not
conform
to
the
stereotype
of
the
Breton
traditionalist

He
was
certainly
no
pious
aristocrat
like
Villemarqu
and
it
is
worth
mentioning
that
despite
the
supposed
inherent
conservatism
of
folklorists
in
Brittany
at
least
it
was
as
much
an
enthusiasm
of
the
left

Emile
Souvestre
had
stood
as
a
Republican
candidate
in
while
leading
contemporaries
of
S
billot
included
Fran
ois
Marie
Luzel
and
Adolphe
Orain
both
editors
of
Republican
newspapers

S
billot
was
born
at
Matignon
C
tes
du
Nord
in
the
son
of
a
doctor
and
a
Republican
activist

He
inherited
his
father
s
politics
writing
a
popular
pamphlet
in
entitled
La
R
publique
c
est
la
tranquilit
which
Luzel
translated
into
Breton

He
married
the
sister
of
the
economist
and
Republican
politician
Yves
Guyot
who
as
editor
of
Le
Si
cle
was
a
well
known
advocate
of
radical
causes
from
Dreyfus
to
feminism

Yet
despite
his
Republican
and
anticlerical
affiliations
in
other
ways
S
billot
was
true
to
the
folklorist
type

He
was
a
member
of
a
well
educated
and
well
connected
bourgeois
family
a
rival
folklorist
would
later
accuse
him
of
abusing
his
position
as
ch
telain
to
make
his
collections

He
was
also
a
d
racin
having
settled
in
Paris
first
as
a
law
student
and
then
as
an
artist
and
writer

Folklore
at
least
initially
had
been
the
exiled
S
billot
s
tribute
to
his
homeland

His
local
patriotism
had
been
fired
by
a
borrowed
copy
of
Souvestre
s
Le
Foyer
breton
while
a
homesick
schoolboy
in


In
his
memoirs
S
billot
recalled
that
the
idea
came
to
me
to
discover
if
there
were
in
my
native
land
marvellous
or
fantastic
stories
worthy
of
inclusion
in
a
Gallo
Hearth

But
what
attracted
S
billot
most
about
Souvestre
s
book
were
the
illustrations
for
he
was
already
nursing
artistic
ambitions

From
to
he
pursued
a
career
as
a
painter

As
the
art
critic
for
various
Republican
journals
in
the
s
and
a
visitor
to
Pont
Aven
S
billot
presumably
knew
of
the
impressionists
but
he
did
not
follow
their
lead

Nor
despite
his
interest
in
the
marvellous
is
there
anything
fey
let
alone
symbolist
about
his
paintings

S
billot
s
artistic
allegiances
were
with
the
realism
of
Am
d
e
Gu
rard
and
Alexandre
Antigna

He
specialised
in
landscapes
of
the
Breton
coast
and
in
particular
the
strange
scenery
of
low
tide
his
first
salon
piece
in
was
entitled
Rocks
at
Low
Tide


This
is
not
a
minor
genre
along
Brittany
s
c
te
d
emeraude
where
the
sea
level
falls
several
metres
daily
revealing
the
rocks
that
made
this
coast
so
dangerous
for
shipping

There
is
an
unexplored
connection
between
the
practice
of
landscape
painting
and
folklore
collecting
in
the
nineteenth
century

Souvestre
had
been
a
painter
before
he
turned
to
writing
while
artists
like
Jules
Bastien
Lepage
occasionally
dabbled
in
folklore

In
S
billot
s
case
the
meticulousness
and
commitment
to
accuracy
apparent
in
his
paintings
would
also
resurface
in
his
work
as
a
folklorist
for
although
he
acknowledged
a
debt
to
predecessors
like
Villemarqu
he
considered
himself
the
leader
of
a
new
generation
of
scientific
investigators

S
billot
s
conversion
from
brush
to
pen
was
particularly
fruitful

In
the
artist
L
once
Petit
asked
S
billot
if
he
could
contribute
some
stories
to
a
book
of
fairy
tales
that
his
friend
hoped
to
illustrate

S
billot
promised
to
see
what
he
could
unearth
the
following
summer
while
on
a
painting
trip
to
Brittany

But
the
weather
that
year
was
dismal
and
while
sheltering
with
peasant
families
S
billot
asked
his
hosts
if
they
knew
any
tales

The
more
than
six
hundred
narratives
he
collected
over
the
following
years
were
the
basis
for
S
billot
s
brilliant
career
as
a
folklorist

They
provided
the
matter
for
more
than
a
dozen
major
publications
starting
in
with
the
first
volume
of
Contes
populaires
de
la
Haute
Bretagne

The
title
implied
that
these
were
characteristically
Breton
tales

S
billot
like
other
folklorists
placed
his
collection
within
the
framework
of
a
geographically
specific
culture
a
trend
he
would
help
propagate
as
editor
of
the
major
collection
Les
Litt
ratures
populaires
de
toutes
les
nations


But
S
billot
was
ahead
of
his
time
in
recognising
that
his
informants
occupations
were
as
significant
to
the
kind
of
stories
they
told
as
the
places
they
lived

More
than
half
the
tales
were
collected
in
and
around
the
fishing
village
of
Saint
Cast
not
far
from
his
hometown
of
Matignon

Hence
the
third
volume
of
the
Contes
populaires
de
la
Haute
Bretagne
was
subtitled
Contes
des
marins

S
billot
had
come
to
Saint
Cast
in
to
paint
but
the
storytelling
talent
of
his
landlady
Rose
Renault
set
him
on
a
different
tack

Her
house
became
the
centre
of
S
billot
s
collecting
activities
as
her
visitors
were
invited
to
contribute
a
tale

Among
them
was
the
story
in
the
appendix
told
in
by
an
elderly
widow
named
Jeanne
le
H
riss


It
concerns
one
of
those
watery
rock
formations
S
billot
painted
so
often
the
Bourdineaux

Oral
history
and
folk
geography
The
Bourdineaux
or
Bourdinots
as
they
now
appear
on
maps
are
a
group
of
rocks
off
the
tip
of
the
Saint
Cast
peninsular
close
to
the
spot
marked
on
S
billot
s
map
of
the
legendary
geography
of
the
area

For
fishermen
the
virtue
of
these
offshore
rocks
was
that
they
were
a
haven
for
marine
wild
life
and
in
the
case
of
the
Bourdineaux
for
skate
in
particular

Le
Heriss
s
story
tells
of
a
battle
for
control
of
the
rocks
between
the
C
tins
of
Saint
Cast
and
the
Jaguens
of
the
rival
fishing
village
of
Saint
Jacut
which
faced
them
across
the
Arguenon
estuary

There
are
numerous
stories
about
conflicts
between
these
two
villages
several
of
which
focus
on
this
same
group
of
rocks

For
example
in
another
tale
the
Jaguens
drop
a
dead
donkey
in
the
sea
in
order
to
claim
all
the
land
it
touched
but
unfortunately
for
them
it
by
passed
the
Bourdineaux

The
donkey
story
was
probably
intended
as
a
joke
but
the
Jeanne
le
H
riss
told
her
tale
as
a
matter
of
history

She
had
learnt
it
from
her
grandfather
and
according
to
him
the
battle
had
taken
place
two
centuries
before

It
is
quite
likely
that
the
story
has
some
basis
in
history

Ownership
or
use
rights
over
land
was
a
dominant
issue
in
village
politics
throughout
France
from
the
Middle
Ages
onwards

Most
communities
were
at
one
time
or
another
engaged
in
protracted
conflicts
with
their
neighbours
about
their
precise
boundaries
access
to
water
the
use
of
the
woods
and
pastures
between
them

These
kinds
of
resources
were
either
communal
property
or
at
least
considered
as
communal
property
and
so
any
dispute
would
involve
the
community
as
a
whole

The
court
records
of
both
old
regime
and
post
revolutionary
France
abound
in
such
cases
but
conflict
was
not
restricted
to
legal
argument
it
was
carried
into
the
fields



Conscription
rallies
fairs
and
even
Breton
pardons
were
all
occasions
for
collective
violence
because
at
these
events
rival
villagers
were
bound
to
meet
and
therefore
argue
with
one
another

In
some
parts
of
France
even
in
the
nineteenth
century
such
riots
frequently
led
to
fatalities

These
village
wars
tended
to
have
a
history

Even
if
boundaries
were
finally
agreed
the
vendetta
between
them
left
legacies
of
triumphs
to
be
boasted
humiliations
to
be
avenged
events
to
be
memorised
and
retold
at
communal
gatherings

The
economic
issue
might
be
settled
but
the
conflict
was
perpetuated
through
the
village
s
oral
culture
which
enshrined
its
code
of
honour

Although
the
Bourdineaux
were
at
sea
their
case
was
not
essentially
different
from
any
landlocked
dispute

They
were
a
collective
economic
resource
to
which
two
communities
laid
claim

Looking
at
the
map
it
would
seem
as
if
the
C
tins
were
in
the
right

There
were
as
they
say
in
story
fishing
right
in
front
of
their
homes

And
yet
other
tales
even
those
told
in
Saint
Cast
acknowledged
some
historic
relationship
between
the
Jaguens
and
the
Bourdineaux

There
are
two
possible
explanations
for
this

Firstly
the
Jaguens
specialised
in
the
fishing
of
skate

This
is
still
apparent
in
the
architecture
of
the
village
which
is
arranged
in
house
rows
with
a
south
facing
fa
ade
where
the
skate
were
hung
to
dry

The
smell
was
to
judge
by
the
frequent
comments
in
the
tales
appalling

As
the
Bourdineaux
abounded
in
skate
the
Jaguens
may
have
felt
a
proprietorial
interest
in
them

Secondly
fishing
rights
in
the
estuary
of
the
Arguenon
river
had
been
the
seigneurial
property
of
the
Abbey
of
Saint
Jacut
so
fish
caught
in
these
waters
had
to
be
landed
at
Saint
Jacut

At
a
pinch
the
Bourdineaux
might
be
included
within
this
seigneurial
domain
although
they
were
at
boundary
of
the
open
sea

As
a
consequence
there
were
in
the
sixteenth
century
numerous
stands
off
between
the
fishing
fleets
of
the
two
villages
leading
to
insults
and
even
injuries

From
the
seventeenth
century
onwards
the
men
of
both
communities
found
employment
in
deep
sea
fishing
in
shore
fishing
declined
and
with
it
the
economic
importance
of
the
Bourdineaux

But
the
dispute
was
not
forgotten
and
references
to
it
were
sure
to
enliven
encounters
between
the
inhabitants
of
the
two
peninsulas

Indeed
the
history
was
still
being
related
in
the
s
according
to
Herv
Collet
who
audio
taped
the
same
tale
as
told
an
old
sailor
of
Saint
Jacut

Unfortunately
this
Jaguen
version
of
events
probably
owes
more
to
a
S
billot
reprint
than
to
any
autochthon
tradition
even
though
there
are
telling
differences
between
the
two

However
it
was
not
to
history
that
each
group
appealed
during
their
confrontation
but
to
legend
in
particular
to
divergent
legends
of
Gargantua

The
story
also
alludes
to
several
other
religious
comic
and
aetiological
legends
which
would
help
listeners
make
sense
of
their
local
geography

Nineteenth
century
folklorists
were
more
interested
in
the
text
than
the
context
and
seldom
asked
themselves
why
particular
stories
were
being
told
at
particular
moments

But
in
Le
H
riss
s
tale
it
is
clear
that
legends
were
not
just
amusing
pastimes
they
had
a
function
it
is
this
functional
aspect
that
provides
the
link
between
a
particular
landscape
and
the
stories
told
within
it

Legends
were
mobilized
as
charters
of
ownership
by
the
communities
that
told
them

According
to
the
Jaguens
the
Bourdineaux
belonged
to
them
because
the
rocks
were
thrown
from
their
village
by
the
giant
Gargantua

The
C
tins
agreed
that
Gargantua
deposited
the
rocks
but
not
for
the
Jaguens
rather
in
disgust
at
them

There
is
a
whole
cycle
of
Gargantua
legends
concerning
this
coastline
often
associated
with
particular
features
such
as
Gargantua
s
tooth
near
Saint
Suliac
or
his
finger
at
Fort
La
Latte
both
prehistoric
standing
stones


S
billot
collected
several
Gargantua
legends
in
Saint
Cast

They
did
not
concur
in
every
detail
but
it
is
nonetheless
possible
to
compile
an
outline
biography
for
the
giant
that
might
have
been
recognised
by
C
tins

To
summarize
Gargantua
was
born
at
Pl
venon

He
liked
to
travel
and
visited
Dinan
Saint
Malo
Paris
and
Jersey

In
each
place
he
terrorised
the
inhabitants
with
his
enormous
appetite
and
marked
the
landscape
in
some
permanent
way

His
leap
from
Fort
La
Latte
to
Saint
Malo
or
in
another
version
to
Jersey
for
instance
is
commemorated
by
the
indent
of
the
giant
s
shoe
on
the
cliff
top

Practically
all
the
rocks
off
the
coast
were
ascribed
to
Gargantua
s
actions

According
to
Fran
ois
Marquer
the
C
tin
cabinboy
who
was
S
billot
s
most
forthcoming
informant
the
Becrond
or
Bec
rond
s
it
now
appears
on
maps
where
the
C
tin
fleet
waited
to
attack
the
Jaguens
was
the
result
of
a
Gargantuan
bout
of
diarrhoea

The
Bourdineaux
were
created
shortly
after
by
the
giant
s
attempts
to
kill
a
barnacle
goose
flying
out
to
sea
by
throwing
stones
taken
from
the
headland

Presumably
the
Jaguens
were
referring
to
a
similar
story
localised
in
their
own
village
during
their
confrontation
on
the
Bourdineaux

The
C
tins
response
was
that
Gargantua
felt
too
much
disgust
for
the
Jaguens
to
provide
for
them
in
this
way

The
story
as
told
in
Saint
Cast
was
that
Gargantua
had
been
coming
home
to
Pl
venon
when
he
came
across
a
Jaguen
boat
loaded
with
skate
caught
on
the
Bourdineaux

He
gobbled
down
the
boat
crew
and
catch
but
as
his
journey
took
him
past
Saint
Jacut
the
smell
of
rotting
fish
made
him
throw
up
his
meal

The
ballast
stones
from
the
boat
were
projected
out
to
sea
and
formed
various
islands
towards
Saint
Briac
and
Saint
Lunaire
in
the
opposite
direction
to
Saint
Cast
and
therefore
undisputed
territory
as
far
as
C
tins
were
concerned


In
other
stories
Gargantua
did
not
eat
the
Jaguen
boat
simply
the
smell
of
its
cargo
was
enough
to
make
him
vomit
up
various
rocks
and
islands

In
some
tales
Gargantua
then
quit
the
country
with
the
words
I
don
t
want
to
see
the
Jaguens
any
more
they
will
kill
me
with
their
obnoxiousness
in
others
he
really
was
overcome
with
disgust
and
died

C
tins
and
Jaguens
told
two
contradictory
legends
about
Gargantua
and
the
Bourdineaux
but
to
what
extent
were
either
believed
Belief
used
to
be
the
test
that
folklorists
applied
to
distinguish
a
folktale
from
a
legend
the
former
being
told
as
a
fiction
and
the
latter
as
a
true
account

However
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
anyone
could
countenance
that
a
handful
of
ballast
stones
provided
the
basis
for
several
islands

All
we
can
say
is
that
the
story
just
like
Le
H
riss
s
was
told
as
if
it
might
be
true
and
so
could
be
cited
as
fact
in
disputes
between
the
two
villages

But
belief
was
not
as
essential
as
agreement
among
the
community
as
to
which
was
the
right
story
or
rather
which
was
the
right
story
for
a
particular
occasion


Which
story
you
knew
and
told
about
Gargantua
the
Bourdineaux
and
the
Jaguens
would
indicate
where
your
loyalties
lay

Thus
the
shared
story
became
the
basis
for
communal
solidarity

Le
H
riss
s
tale
draws
on
many
other
distinctions
between
the
two
villages

The
two
fleets
even
arrive
on
the
scene
in
different
kinds
of
boat
those
of
the
Jaguens
are
called
simply
boats
but
the
C
tins
had
dinghies


Canot
or
dinghy
was
the
term
used
for
the
small
stubby
but
manoeuvrable
boats
that
fishermen
of
both
villages
adopted
during
the
nineteenth
century

The
implication
of
the
story
however
is
that
the
C
tins
had
them
first
they
were
therefore
more
up
to
date
and
civilised
than
their
neighbours

This
claim
to
cultural
superiority
was
confirmed
whenever
the
Jaguens
opened
their
mouths

By
and
large
S
billot
s
fishermen
storytellers
spoke
good
French
when
telling
tales
and
were
proud
of
it

Patois
was
for
them
the
language
of
peasants
who
had
never
learnt
anything
of
the
world

Yet
according
to
S
billot
whenever
one
of
his
storytellers
adopted
the
voice
of
a
Jaguen
he
or
she
would
put
on
a
distinct
accent
and
lace
their
speech
with
characteristic
swearing
Dieu
me
danse
or
Dieu
me
gagne
a
change
S
billot
indicated
on
the
written
page
with
italics

He
went
on
to
point
out
however
that
the
level
of
education
and
therefore
presumably
correct
French
usage
was
higher
in
Saint
Jacut
than
in
nearby
villages

But
for
the
storyteller
it
was
not
necessary
that
Jaguens
actually
spoke
like
this
but
that
her
audience
and
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
region
generally
understood
that
this
was
how
Jaguens
were
supposed
to
speak

Storytellers
from
all
over
France
used
similar
tactics
to
denigrate
their
despised
neighbours

A
further
distinction
between
the
villages
is
offered
by
the
collective
nicknames
the
blason
populaire
exchanged
between
the
fishermen

The
C
tins
apparently
because
of
the
colour
of
their
water
proofs
were
called
petits
Jaunes
by
the
Jaguens
while
the
latter
were
termed
Houohaous


According
to
S
billot
most
C
tins
thought
this
was
an
insult
implying
that
the
Jaguens
howled
like
dogs
but
it
may
have
derived
from
Saint
Houohaou
the
name
given
by
the
fishermen
to
a
rock
at
the
end
of
the
Saint
Jacut
peninsular

As
they
passed
the
rock
Jaguens
would
offer
up
a
prayer
Saint
Houohaou
give
us
mackerel


Every
village
in
France
seems
to
have
had
at
least
one
such
collective
sobriquet
picking
up
on
some
distinguishing
aspect
of
dress
economic
activity
character
or
history

However
the
blason
was
not
used
by
the
villagers
themselves
only
by
their
neighbours
who
were
also
their
enemies

They
were
commonly
exchanged
during
disputes
over
territories

The
origins
of
many
nicknames
are
obscure
but
where
they
can
be
traced
they
often
relate
to
places
or
events
on
these
disputed
frontiers

The
rock
of
Saint
Houohaou
for
example
is
at
the
edge
of
the
commune
of
Saint
Jacut
and
the
open
sea

It
is
in
a
sense
a
boundary
marker

Geography
and
cultural
identity
are
once
more
brought
together

The
people
of
Saint
Cast
held
the
Jaguens
in
low
esteem
Daft
as
a
Jaguen
went
the
local
proverb

This
reputation
was
widely
known
on
the
coast

S
billot
collected
stories
about
Jaguens
at
Dinard
Matignon
and
even
one
from
an
inhabitant
of
Saint
Jacut

At
Dinan
stories
about
idiots
whatever
their
origin
were
termed
a
Jaguens
t
s


An
example
of
such
a
tale
is
the
Jaguens
Journey


Because
they
were
so
backward
and
had
never
left
their
village
before
they
mistook
a
field
of
flax
for
the
sea
and
a
partridge
for
a
feathered
fish

On
another
occasion
they
thought
a
lobster
was
the
devil

Similar
if
less
maritime
stories
were
told
about
dozens
of
other
villages
in
France
and
further
afield
such
as
the
famous
Wise
Men
of
Gotham
in
Nottinghamshire
just
one
of
at
least
forty
five
places
in
England
described
as
the
village
of
fools


Numskull
tales
as
these
kind
of
tales
are
listed
in
the
international
type
index
prove
once
more
that
folklore
knows
no
boundaries

One
can
find
nearly
identical
stories
in
the
literature
of
ancient
India
Turkey
and
China

But
while
they
were
known
all
over
the
world
they
were
not
told
as
universally
valid
but
rather
only
as
true
for
particular
villages

It
was
not
the
folklorist
who
located
them
in
the
landscape
it
was
the
narrators

We
get
a
hint
of
the
Jaguens
reputation
near
the
beginning
of
this
story
when
they
demand
that
no
guns
be
used
as
no
one
in
Saint
Jacut
knew
how
to
fire
one

But
the
full
depth
of
their
stupidity
is
saved
until
the
end
when
disgusted
at
Jesus
for
not
helping
them
even
though
they
had
taken
the
trouble
to
bring
him
along
on
his
cross
they
drag
the
crucifix
through
the
streets
and
finally
burn
it

Despite
or
more
probably
because
of
the
presence
of
an
abbey
in
the
village
several
Jaguen
tales
turn
on
their
misunderstanding
of
or
contempt
for
both
the
symbols
of
the
Church
and
its
personnel

Hence
the
proverbial
phrase
It
s
like
the
old
Jaguens
who
no
more
believed
in
God
than
in
his
saints


C
tins
could
also
be
anticlerical
even
sceptical
on
occasions
and
yet
still
look
down
on
their
neighbours
not
so
much
for
their
lack
of
belief
but
because
they
did
not
know
how
to
behave

Given
S
billot
s
politics
he
probably
rather
enjoyed
these
stories
although
he
got
into
a
bit
of
trouble
with
local
Catholics
when
he
published
the
story
of
the
Le
Bon
Dieu
de
Saint
Jacut
in
a
local
newspaper

In
this
story
the
Jaguens
realise
they
are
the
only
village
without
such
an
asset
which
may
account
for
a
series
of
poor
barley
harvests

But
even
when
they
have
erected
their
own
crucifix
the
harvest
are
no
better
so
they
beat
and
even
shoot
the
figure
of
Jesus

This
may
be
a
deliberately
ironic
counter
comment
to
the
common
legend
of
Breton
piety
in
which
a
peasant
refuses
to
strike
a
crucifix
despite
threats
from
Republican
troops
and
dies
a
martyr
s
death

The
Jaguens
finally
decide
to
kill
their
God
but
unsure
how
this
might
be
done
safely
they
carry
him
over
to
the
Isle
Agot
in
the
bay
and
leave
him
there

Le
H
riss
s
tale
picks
up
on
both
the
Jaguens
anticlerical
reputation
and
their
mistreatment
of
the
crucifix

It
is
also
has
aetiological
aspects
because
the
crucifix
has
since
disappeared
from
the
Isle
Agot
yet
one
can
still
see
the
base
where
it
stood

What
Freud
called
the
narcissism
of
minor
differences
mattered
a
lot
in
these
small
face
to
face
communities

The
untutored
eye
might
have
found
little
to
separate
the
villages
of
Saint
Cast
and
Saint
Jacut
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
C
tins
would
have
been
insulted
by
any
such
comparison

It
would
have
sullied
their
reputation
and
reputation
was
vital
to
their
well
being

The
advancement
of
credit
getting
the
best
berths
on
ship
the
chances
to
make
a
good
marriage
all
depended
on
the
good
name
of
one
s
family
and
community

Yet
reputation
is
a
strange
thing
in
that
one
can
only
increase
one
s
own
by
diminishing
one
s
rivals

Telling
numskull
stories
emphasises
the
superior
reputation
of
one
s
own
community
by
denigrating
another
s
and
this
helps
reunite
one
s
village
in
a
sense
of
its
own
worth

Otherwise
it
was
in
danger
of
being
torn
apart
by
its
own
internal
honour
disputes
between
families
and
colleagues

A
fishing
community
like
Saint
Cast
may
have
had
particular
need
of
the
balm
of
storytelling
which
perhaps
accounts
for
why
S
billot
found
it
such
a
fertile
source


Fishermen
liked
to
create
for
themselves
a
persona
of
aggressive
individualism
so
unlike
the
servile
peasants
they
despised

In
folktales
this
persona
took
shape
as
the
hero
Tribord
Amures
the
sailor
who
gave
way
to
no
man

Such
attitudes
helped
the
men
to
cope
with
the
grinding
misery
of
their
work
on
the
Newfoundland
banks
and
the
ruthless
competition
fostered
between
them
by
the
trawler
captains

Much
of
S
billot
s
collection
was
told
by
boys
apprentice
fishermen
whose
tales
evinced
characteristics
of
devil
may
care
heroism
and
a
refusal
ever
to
bow
one
s
head

Thus
they
demonstrated
they
had
acquired
the
fishermen
s
morality
and
were
ready
to
enter
the
world
of
men

But
fishermen
also
needed
the
community
their
work
was
dangerous
and
their
relied
on
warnings
and
help
given
by
their
colleagues
if
they
died
at
sea
they
needed
to
know
that
their
loved
ones
would
be
cared
for
and
if
they
were
denied
access
to
their
fishing
grounds
they
needed
the
community
to
come
to
their
support
as
in
the
case
of
the
Bourdineaux

Storytelling
was
one
mechanism
through
which
that
community
reconnected
with
itself

This
one
story
of
the
Battle
of
the
Bourdineaux
has
led
us
on
quite
a
tour
of
the
region
around
Saint
Cast
from
Pl
venon
to
the
Isle
Agot

For
a
storyteller
like
Jeanne
Le
H
riss
the
landscape
oozed
narratives

Stories
endowed
space
with
meanings

Guided
by
her
tale
Le
H
riss
s
audience
could
orientate
themselves
in
the
landscape
aetiological
legends
like
that
of
Gargantua
s
finger
and
lieux
dits
such
as
the
Becrond
contained
descriptions
of
landmarks
which
together
formed
a
working
map
of
the
area

Legends
were
an
informal
education
in
significant
geography
one
learnt
the
boundaries
of
one
s
community
with
one
s
neighbours
and
just
as
importantly
with
the
supernatural

Legends
connected
the
vital
history
of
the
community
to
its
environment

No
C
tin
fisherman
could
forget
that
his
ancestors
had
fought
and
won
their
claim
to
the
Bourdineaux
for
the
rocks
themselves
were
a
daily
visual
mnemonic

During
Rogationtide
ceremonies
in
England
boys
accompanying
the
procession
around
the
perimeter
of
the
parish
would
be
beaten
at
each
boundary
marker
to
help
them
more
vividly
their
exact
location

Legends
served
a
similar
if
less
painful
function

They
were
the
collective
memory
of
the
community

Storytelling
also
gave
Jeanne
Le
H
riss
a
continuing
role
in
the
village

The
Le
H
riss
family
had
lived
in
Saint
Cast
since
at
least
the
fifteenth
century
and
although
they
had
lost
their
letters
of
nobility
in
Jeanne
s
great
grandfather
still
styled
himself
noble
cuyer
when
he
built
the
manor
of
Sainte
Blanche
in


But
since
the
revolution
the
family
s
social
status
and
fortune
had
declined
markedly

Jeanne
s
grandfather
had
been
a
substantial
landowner
but
Jeanne
had
married
a
simple
fisherman
Marc
Renault

Like
so
many
of
his
compatriots
he
had
died
at
sea
leaving
her
with
at
least
five
children
to
bring
up

A
widow
in
her
late
fifties
with
three
daughters
still
living
at
home
Jeanne
was
in
danger
of
becoming
a
marginal
figure
even
in
a
matriarchal
community
like
Saint
Cast

Yet
she
retained
some
cultural
capital
she
knew
things
that
might
be
important
to
future
generations
of
C
tins
like
why
the
Bourdineaux
belonged
to
them

In
her
story
both
C
tins
and
Jaguens
turn
to
their
oldest
inhabitants
in
this
crisis
because
as
Jeanne
puts
it
among
the
old
there
is
always
one
cleverer
than
the
others


She
was
in
an
oblique
fashion
talking
about
herself

The
lessons
she
gave
in
folk
geography
staked
her
claim
to
full
membership
in
the
community

These
two
works
have
been
very
influential
on
historical
scholarship

Both
concepts
at
least
in
common
usage
among
historians
concern
the
mobilisation
of
collective
identities
supposedly
based
on
historical
continuities
but
which
have
in
fact
been
constructed
by
elites
or
would
be
elites
to
meet
the
needs
of
current
political
ideologies

Anthropology
in
particular
has
been
forced
onto
the
defensive

While
preparing
this
paper
I
chanced
on
this
pithy
challenge
almost
every
generation
of
anthropologists
has
condemned
previous
researchers
for
faulty
studies
imperialistic
or
colonialist
arrogance
or
plain
doctoring
of
the
material

The
idea
of
the
participant
observer
has
little
credibility
in
academic
circles
and
the
standing
of
much
ethnographic
research
is
these
days
roughly
on
a
par
with

Folktale
narrators
in

France
often
preferred
to
tell
their
tales
in
French

understood
to

if
their

The

emphasised
