Embrace
Your
Fate
In
a
game
of
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
your
cards
are
divided
between
two
decks

The
first
is
the
dynasty
deck
which
contains
your
characters
and
holdings
like
those
shown
above

l
c
anc
cardfan

png
The
second
deck
is
your
conflict
deck
which
has
a
mix
of
characters
attachments
including
weapons
followers
equipment
and
other
conditions
and
events

Between
your
two
decks
are
four
face
down
province
cards
as
shown
below
and
protecting
these
provinces
is
essential
to
maintaining
your
strength
and
defeating
your
opponent

l
c
game
setup
png
At
the
beginning
of
the
game
a
card
from
the
top
of
your
dynasty
deck
is
placed
on
top
of
each
of
the
four
province
cards
between
your
decks
while
the
fifth
province
hosts
your
stronghold

As
the
round
begins
the
dynasty
cards
on
your
four
central
provinces
are
turned
face
up
and
during
the
dynasty
phase
you
and
your
opponent
will
take
turns
playing
characters
from
your
provinces

All
characters
have
a
cost
shown
in
the
upper
left
corner
that
must
be
paid
in
fate
a
currency
that
represents
the
karma
and
destiny
that
a
clan
has
accrued

There
is
an
additional
cost
however
that
must
be
considered

In
Rokugani
culture
a
central
philosophical
concept
is
mono
no
aware

Literally
translating
to
the
pathos
of
things
mono
no
aware
is
an
understanding
and
bittersweet
acceptance
that
everything
in
the
world
is
impermanent
and
transient

In
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
this
is
played
out
through
your
characters
and
your
fate

After
playing
a
character
from
one
of
your
provinces
you
may
choose
to
pay
any
number
of
additional
fate
placing
these
fate
tokens
directly
onto
the
character

l
c
playing
character
diagram

For
instance
you
may
choose
to
play
the
Matsu
Berserker
Core
Set
from
a
province
paying
one
fate
as
shown
above

Considering
your
options
you
decide
that
you
will
want
this
character
in
play
for
several
rounds
so
you
place
two
more
fate
from
your
supply
onto
this
character

At
the
end
of
this
round
one
of
those
fate
tokens
will
be
removed
from
the
Matsu
Berserker

If
you
had
chosen
to
not
place
any
additional
fate
on
the
Matsu
Berserker
this
character
would
have
been
discarded
in
this
round
s
fate
phase
the
Matsu
Berserker
will
have
fulfilled
their
destiny
at
this
point
in
the
ongoing
narrative
of
your
game

l
c
fate
diagram
png
During
the
fate
phase
at
the
end
of
the
round
the
Steadfast
Samurai
has
no
fate
and
is
discarded

One
fate
is
removed
from
the
Matsu
Berserker

By
placing
additional
fate
tokens
on
a
character
you
are
in
essence
paying
to
keep
that
character
in
play
for
additional
rounds

Choosing
exactly
how
much
fate
to
invest
in
a
character
is
a
key
strategic
decision
If
you
don
t
pay
enough
you
could
find
your
best
characters
have
fulfilled
their
destiny
and
departed
just
when
you
need
them
most

If
you
pay
too
much
however
you
may
have
bound
your
clan
s
destiny
to
a
single
character
which
could
leave
you
vulnerable
to
attacks
on
multiple
fronts

Compounding
the
decision
is
the
fact
that
you
ll
need
to
save
some
fate
if
you
re
going
to
play
conflict
cards
from
your
hand
later
in
the
round

The
clans
gain
more
fate
at
the
beginning
of
each
new
round
but
deciding
how
to
use
your
fate
is
crucial
to
victory

Uphold
Your
Honor
After
both
players
have
passed
on
the
chance
to
play
additional
characters
in
the
dynasty
phase
the
game
proceeds
to
the
draw
phase

Here
you
and
your
opponent
each
have
the
chance
to
select
how
many
cards
you
will
draw
from
your
conflict
decks
which
contains
the
tactics
and
maneuvers
that
you
keep
hidden
in
your
hand
but
you
must
be
cautious
because
the
honor
of
your
entire
clan
is
at
stake

Each
player
has
an
honor
dial
featuring
numbers
from
one
to
five

The
number
that
you
select
indicates
how
honorably
you
intend
to
act
during
the
coming
round
with
a
low
number
equating
to
a
more
honorable
path
and
a
high
number
equating
to
a
less
honorable
path

The
number
that
you
select
is
also
the
number
of
cards
that
you
will
draw
from
your
conflict
deck

After
both
players
have
secretly
chosen
a
number
you
will
each
reveal
your
dial
and
draw
the
number
of
cards
that
you
chose
but
if
you
re
relying
on
dishonorable
tricks
from
your
conflict
deck
you
ll
pay
with
your
clan
s
honor

For
instance
if
you
reveal
a
dial
with
a
five
and
your
opponent
reveals
a
dial
with
a
one
you
must
pay
him
four
honor
the
difference
between
the
two
bids

Then
you
would
draw
five
cards
your
bid
he
would
draw
one
card
his
bid
and
the
draw
phase
would
be
complete

l
c
honor
dial
diagram
png
When
setting
a
number
on
your
dial
you
are
essentially
bidding
honor
against
your
opponent

A
low
bid
allows
you
to
preserve
your
honor
or
gain
more
honor
from
your
opponent
and
in
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
maintaining
your
honor
is
of
the
utmost
importance

Choosing
a
higher
number
on
the
other
hand
may
sacrifice
some
honor
but
it
also
fills
your
hand
with
conflict
cards
that
could
give
you
exactly
what
you
need
during
a
conflict
Betting
against
your
opponent
and
guarding
your
honor
leads
to
countless
strategic
moments
during
the
game

Face
Your
Enemy
Once
both
players
have
drawn
cards
conflict
begins
in
earnest
inviting
players
to
initiate
military
and
political
confrontations

These
confrontations
could
represent
pitched
battle
a
physical
fight
a
trial
a
debate
or
a
contest
of
courtly
intrigues
but
in
any
circumstance
your
end
goal
is
to
break
your
opponent
s
provinces

Each
player
has
the
option
to
declare
up
to
two
conflicts
during
the
conflict
phase

Players
alternate
declaring
conflicts
and
each
player
can
initiate
one
military
conflict
and
one
political
conflict

You
may
even
choose
to
pass
your
first
conflict
waiting
to
see
how
your
opponent
acts
and
then
commit
your
full
strength
to
your
second
conflict
later

l
c
military
and
political
icons

When
you
do
choose
to
initiate
a
conflict
you
face
an
array
of
strategic
options
and
choices

You
must
choose
which
characters
will
participate
in
the
conflict
while
carefully
ensuring
you
have
enough
characters
left
to
defend
against
your
opponent
because
undefended
provinces
are
easily
broken
and
you
ll
lose
honor
for
failing
to
defend
your
lands

You
must
also
choose
which
enemy
province
to
attack
at
the
start
of
the
game
all
province
cards
are
face
down
hiding
their
true
nature
but
as
your
forces
move
into
enemy
lands
you
ll
discover
what
lies
in
wait
potentially
undermining
your
plans
with
an
unwanted
surprise

Finally
you
must
determine
the
type
and
ring
used
for
the
conflict

Every
conflict
must
be
either
military
or
political
which
corresponds
to
the
military
and
political
skills
of
your
characters
only
the
skill
that
matches
your
chosen
conflict
type
is
used
for
this
conflict

Along
with
the
type
of
conflict
you
ll
select
one
of
the
five
rings
Air
Earth
Fire
Water
or
Void

The
ring
that
you
use
for
the
conflict
determines
the
consequences
if
you
are
victorious
as
the
attacker

l

Take
one

from

Earth
Draw
one
card
from
your

deck
and
discard
one
random
card
from
your
opponent
s
hand

Fire
Choose
a
character
in
play
and
honor
or
dishonor
that
character

Honoring
or
dishonoring
a
character
has
a
potent
effect
on
that
character
s
skill
and
causes
you
to
gain
or
lose
honor
when
that
character
leaves
play

Water
Choose
a
character
and
ready
it
or
choose
a
character
with
no
fate
and

it

Choose
a
character
and
remove
one
fate
from
it

In
the
diagram
above
the
Dragon
player
initiates
a
military
Fire
conflict
sending
two
characters
forward
against
an
unrevealed
province

Once
the
conflict
has
been
initiated
your
opponent
declares
defenders
and
the
conflict
unfolds

During
the
conflict
you
and
your
opponent
will
trade
actions
triggering
abilities
and
playing
cards
from
your
conflict
hand
to
gain
the
advantage

You
may
play
attachments
characters
and
events
from
your
conflict
hand
to
increase
your
characters
skill
decrease
the
skill
of
your
foes
bow
enemy
characters
send
characters
home
to
remove
them
from
the
fight
or
trigger
even
more
unusual
effects

Eventually
however
both
players
will
pass
and
one
of
you
will
win
the
conflict

In
addition
if
your
skill
surpasses
the
defender
s
skill
by
a
sufficient
amount
you
will
break
your
opponent
s
province
bringing
you
one
step
closer
to
victory
Then
the
victor
claims

contested
ring
all
attacking

bow
and
return
home
and

conflict
is
at

Honor
Is
Stronger
Than

Breaking
enemy
provinces
moves
you
directly
closer
to
victory
in
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game

Though
your
opponents
can
still
play
new
cards
from
their
broken
provinces
if
you
break
three
of
your
opponent
s
four
provinces
you
will
be
allowed
to
declare
conflicts
against
their
stronghold

A
clan
s
stronghold
is
the
seat
of
its
power
providing
your
supply
of
fate
determining
your
starting
honor
and
offering
a
powerful
ability
that
can
be
used
throughout
the
game

Underneath
your
stronghold
you
ll
place
a
fifth
province
card
at
the
beginning
of
the
game
like
the
four
province
cards
that
you
ve
placed
between
your
dynasty
deck
and
your
conflict
deck

Your
opponent
s
stronghold
will
be
the
site
of
a
dramatic
final
conflict
and
whether
that
takes
the
form
of
a
military
siege
or
a
measured
political
negotiation
is
up
to
you

Either
way
if
you
can
break
your
opponent
s
stronghold
province
after
breaking
three
of
his
other
provinces
you
immediately
win
the
game

Still
conflict
is
not
the
only
way
that
you
can
win
a
game
of
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game

As
previously
mentioned
the
honor
of
your
clan
is
crucial
to
maintaining
your
standing
in
the
Emerald
Empire

If
you
ever
attain
twenty
five
honor
during
the
game
you
immediately
win
the
game
Similarly
you
can
also
shame
and
dishonor
your
opponent
into
nothingness

If
a
player
ever
loses
all
of
his
honor
he
immediately
loses
the
game

With
three
distinct
paths
to
victory
you
ll
have
careful
choices
to
make
both
when
building
your
decks
and
playing
the
game
The
Great
Clans
of
Rokugan
Seven
Great
Clans
await
your
command
in
the
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
Core
Set

For
over
years
the
Great
Clans
have
served
the
Chrysanthemum
Throne
according
to
their
unique
strengths
and
weaknesses

As
new
conflicts
erupt
across
Rokugan
you
ll
need
to
decide
which
clan
has
won
your
loyalty
l
c
art

png
The
Crab
Clan
To
the
south
of
Rokugan
lie
the
blighted
Shadowlands
a
dark
realm
under
the
sway
of
Fu
Leng
and
the
corrupted
armies
from
the
realm
of
Jigoku

The
only
safeguard
between
the
Shadowlands
and
Rokugan
is
the
mighty
Kaiu
Wall
and
its
constructers
and
defenders
the
Crab
Clan

To
those
who
look
upon
the
Crab
kindly
their
strength
is
impressive
and
their
determination
honorable

But
to
those
who
do
not
those
who
benefit
from
the
protection
of
the
Wall
without
knowing
the
sacrifices
it
requires
the
Crab
are
impolite
brutes
too
pigheaded
to
comprehend
the
intricacies
of
court
decorum

Regardless
of
how
others
might
view
them
the
Crab
cannot
mire
themselves
in
bickering
and
intrigue

They
present
their
back
to
the
court
only
so
they
may
more
fully
face
the
true
enemy
in
the
Shadowlands
beyond

As
rugged
stoic
and
tenacious
defenders
of
the
Empire
the
Crab
are
at
their
best
when
they
are
defending
against
attacks
and
reacting
to
an
opponent
s
aggression
weathering
your
opponent
s
best
attacks
and
retaliating
when
your
foe
is
most
vulnerable

As
builders
who
excel
at
living
off
the
land
holdings
are
important
to
the
Crab
to
protect
their
provinces
and
power
their
characters

The
Crane
Clan
To
the
rest
of
the
Empire
the
Crane
are
a
study
in
contrasts

They
are
both
respected
and
hated
for
their
achievements
both
admired
and
envied
for
their
elegance
and
grace

They
are
the
makers
of
beauty
and
beauty
itself
devotees
of
peace
and
civility
who
nonetheless
wield
lethal
blades

From
the
Crane
s
impeccable
garments
which
set
the
standards
for
style
in
the
Empire
to
the
sprawling
beauty
and
wonder
of
their
Fantastic
Gardens
to
their
seemingly
limitless
talent
for
artistic
accomplishments
and
political
dominance
in
Rokugan
s
courts
the
Crane
don
t
simply
define
what
it
means
to
be
a
civilized
Empire
they
are
the
very
civilized
essence
of
Rokugan

The
Crane
are
known
throughout
the
Emerald
Empire
as
a
political
powerhouse
with
wise
and
honorable
courtiers
guiding
the
clan
and
protecting
themselves
from
external
threats

In
the
game
you
must
leverage
this
political
might
to
devastate
your
opponents
during
conflicts
keeping
your
characters
honored
to
increase
their
skill
and
controlling
the
board
by
pushing
your
opponent
s
characters
away

The
Dragon
Clan
In
contrast
to
the
conformity
that
permeates
the
land
of
Rokugan
the
Dragon
Clan
chases
individual
enlightenment

Secluded
in
the
northern
mountains
the
Dragon
rarely
focus
on
the
internal
politics
of
Rokugan
instead
turning
their
eyes
to
the
future
and
the
mysterious
visions
of
their
founder
the
Kami
Togashi

Indeed
few
can
truly
say
they
understand
the
Dragon

Some
insist
their
beloved
paradoxes
and
puzzles
are
no
more
than
a
game
triviality
masquerading
as
depth

To
this
accusation
the
Dragon
quote
a
common
saying
of
their
monks
What
is
wisdom
one
asked

What
is
not
wisdom
the
other
answered

The
Dragon
are
a
mysterious
and
individualistic
clan

The
use
of
attachments
is
one
of
this
clan
s
greatest
strengths
and
it
s
wise
to
invest
in
a
few
powerful
characters
with
plans
to
give
them
multiple
attachments

The
concept
of
balance
is
also
important
to
this
clan
and
they
are
well
suited
for
both
military
and
political
conflicts

You
must
take
advantage
of
this
flexibility
and
strike
wherever
you
opponent
leaves
an
opening

The
Lion
Clan
Sitting
opposed
to
the
Crane
s
political
skills
is
the
pure
military
might
of
the
Lion
Clan

Every
samurai
who
lives
in
Rokugan
measures
courage
honor
and
duty
against
the
standard
set
by
the
Lion
Clan

With
the
largest
standing
army
in
Rokugan
the
Lion
have
earned
their
place
as
the
Right
Hand
of
the
emperor

Above
all
the
Lion
Clan
lives
breathes
and
dies
for
the
Emperor
and
Rokugan

Should
the
interests
of
the
Emperor
and
the
welfare
of
the
Empire
diverge
toward
what
deadly
paths
or
dishonorable
fates
would
the
Lion
march
The
Lion
are
a
proud
aggressive
and
violent
clan
that
leverages
its
strong
military
skill
to
win
conflicts

Lion
decks
frequently
aim
to
swarm
the
play
area
with
characters
strengthening
their
presence
through
numbers

However
Lion
characters
with
political
skill
are
harder
to
come
by
so
it
s
important
to
have
some
extra
fate
to
keep
your
few
courtiers
and
politicians
in
play

The
Phoenix
Clan
The
Phoenix
is
a
symbol
of
contradictions
explosive
power
and
great
restraint
vast
intelligence
and
deep
humility
immolating
self
sacrifice
and
glorious
rebirth

These
entwined
virtues
illuminate
the
path
of
Rokugan
s
most
mystical
Great
Clan
the
keepers
of
the
Tao
of
Shinsei
and
caretakers
of
the
Empire
s
soul

The
Phoenix
are
the
masters
of
magic
in
Rokugan
but
they
are
also
staunch
pacifists
with
little
interest
in
warfare

Wise
players
will
use
the
clan
s
shugenja
to
trigger
powerful
effects
against
your
opponent
from
the
safety
of
your
home
area

The
clan
s
mastery
of
the
elemental
rings
will
also
help
to
deny
your
opponent
the
effects
they
aim
to
use
against
you
while
ensuring
you
can
use
the
rings
you
need
to
win

This
clan
s
distaste
for
violence
can
also
be
used
as
a
calming
influence
upon
your
opponent
making
overt
aggression
and
military
conflicts
much
less
effective
against
you

The
Scorpion
Clan
With
six
terrible
words
the
Kami
Bayushi
set
his
followers
in
the
newly
founded
Scorpion
Clan
on
a
dark
and
dangerous
path

Enemies
loomed
beyond
Rokugan
s
borders
but
they
also
lurked
within
them

Bayushi
swore
to
protect
the
Empire
by
any
means
necessary

Where
the
Code
of
Bushid
tied
the
Emperor
s
Left
and
Right
Hands
the
courtiers
of
the
Crane
and
the
mighty
legions
of
the
Lion
the
Emperor
s
Underhand
could
still
reach

To
combat
the
liars
the
thieves
and
the
traitors
within
the
Great
Clans
Bayushi
s
followers
would
have
to
lie
steal
and
cheat
in
turn

The
weapons
of
the
Scorpion
became
blackmail
and
poison
and
sabotage

The
Scorpion
dirtied
their
hands
so
that
others
could
remain
pure

Yet
in
spite
of
and
perhaps
because
of
the
clan
s
fearsome
reputation
there
is
none
more
loyal
than
a
Scorpion

In
a
clan
of
deceivers
and
manipulators
trust
is
a
hard
earned
treasure
to
be
cherished
and
guarded

Such
fierce
loyalty
is
a
small
consolation
at
least
given
the
dangerous
but
vital
role
the
Scorpion
have
played
in
the
Empire
from
the
moment
their
Kami
spoke
his
fateful
words
I
will
be
your
villain
Hantei

While
playing
the
Scorpion
Clan
you
ll
want
to
make
high
honor
bids
in
order
to
draw
extra
cards
and
surprise
your
opponents
with
potent
tricks
and
traps

Yet
you
must
always
maintain
your
deepest
loyalty
lest
you
lose
all
honor
and
the
game

Dishonor
is
also
a
powerful
tool
when
turned
against
your
foes
to
keep
their
skill
low
and
their
hopes
of
beating
you
in
conflict
even
lower

The
Unicorn
Clan
For
years
the
Ki
Rin
Clan
journeyed
beyond
Rokugan
s
borders
in
search
of
external
threats
to
the
Emerald
Empire

In
these
foreign
lands
the
clan
learned
to
adapt
to
do
whatever
it
took
to
survive

The
clan
eventually
returned
to
Rokugan
rechristened
as
the
Unicorn
Clan
its
members
speaking
foreign
tongues
wielding
strange
weapons
and
drawing
upon
the
kami
using
sorcery
known
as
meish
d


The
Unicorn
s
return
was
greeted
as
a
barbarian
invasion
carving
a
place
in
Rokugani
society
by
breaking
through
the
defenses
mounted
by
the
Crab
and
Lion
clans

Reintegration
has
not
been
without
difficulty
but
there
are
lights
in
the
darkness

An
ancient
treaty
with
the
Crane
was
honored
providing
the
Unicorn
a
strong
ally
within
the
Empire

The
Phoenix
watch
Unicorn
magic
with
equal
parts
interest
and
concern

The
Dragon
perceive
the
wisdom
of
Shinjo
s
children
the
Scorpion
see
the
advantage
in
a
pliable
ally
and
all
Rokugan
marvels
at
the
speed
and
might
of
their
magnificent
steeds

Perhaps
they
are
finally
where
they
belong

The
Unicorn
are
an
aggressive
practical
and
nomadic
clan
that
has
mastered
the
arts
of
mobility
and
warfare

You
must
use
the
clan
s
powerful
cavalry
characters
to
outmaneuver
your
opponent
during
conflicts
brining
your
characters
into
and
out
of
conflict
to
keep
your
opponent
on
edge

The
Unicorn
are
strongest
when
they
are
first
to
act
and
much
more
comfortable
attacking
than
defending
so
be
sure
to
play
aggressively
and
get
to
your
opponent
before
they
get
to
you

Enter
the
Emerald
Empire
The
world
of
Rokugan
is
spread
out
before
you
choose
your
clan
and
uphold
your
honor
with
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
What
are
the
major
changes
from
the
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
collectible
card
game
As
part
of
the
transition
for
a
collectible
card
game
CCG
to
a
Living
Card
Game
LCG
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
had
to
go
through
a
significant
transformation
and
although
there
are
many
familiar
elements
within
the
game
the
gameplay
itself
is
very
different

Because
of
this
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
is
incompatible
with
the
CCG
version
of
the
game

Below
we
ll
highlight
a
few
of
the
most
important
differences
with
the
new
version
of
the
game

Provinces
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
uses
a
very
familiar
game
layout
with
a
dynasty
deck
containing
characters
and
holdings
on
your
left
and
a
conflict
deck
containing
a
limited
number
of
characters
that
can
be
played
from
your
hand
attachments
and
events
on
your
right

Between
these
two
decks
are
four
provinces
that
hold
cards
from
your
dynasty
deck
as
in
the
CCG

However
each
province
is
now
represented
by
its
own
individual
card

Province
cards
offer
different
strengths
and
abilities
and
choosing
your
provinces
is
an
important
part
of
deckbuilding

Furthermore
when
a
province
is
broken
it
does
not
disappear
preventing
a
snowball
effect
that
weakens
a
player
who
starts
losing
provinces

Characters
Characters
in
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
take
on
a
different
form
than
the
characters
in
the
CCG

First
characters
now
feature
different
stats
reflecting
their
military
and
political
skill
instead
of
the
force
and
chi
stats

These
new
skills
are
used
in
the
revised
conflict
system
that
we
discuss
below

Characters
no
longer
have
honor
requirements
and
their
personal
honor
is
incorporated
into
their
glory
and
the
Honored
Dishonored
status
cards

l

Conflict
The
conflict
system
for
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
has
been
completely
redesigned

There
are
now
two
different
types
of
conflicts
military
and
political

The
conflict
type
determines
which
skill
your
characters
will
use

In
other
words
during
a
military
conflict
you
will
compare
your
characters
military
skill
against
the
military
skill
of
your
opponent
s
characters

During
the
conflict
you
and
your
opponent
will
manipulate
the
skill
of
your
characters
by
triggering
abilities
from
cards
in
play
and
playing
cards
from
your
conflict
hand

Like
events
the
attachments
and
characters
in
your
conflict
deck
can
be
played
directly
into
a
conflict
to
affect
the
result
of
the
ongoing
struggle

In
addition
the
titular
five
rings
are
inherently
tied
to
conflict
rather
than
taking
the
place
of
cards
in
the
deck

When
you
declare
a
conflict
you
will
choose
one
of
the
five
rings

If
you
win
the
conflict
as
the
attacker
the
ring
that
you
chose
determines
the
rewards
that
you
claim

In
addition
the
loser
of
a
conflict
no
longer
loses
all
of
his
characters

information

conflicts

the

Your
Enemy
section

on
this
page

Resources
The
resource
system
for
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
has
also
been
completely
redesigned

The
resources
that
you
obtain
are
no
longer
based
on
holdings
instead
you
will
receive
a
set
quantity
of
fate
the
game
s
central
currency
at
the
beginning
of
each
round

The
amount
of
fate
you
receive
is
decided
by
your
stronghold

There
are
multiple
ways
to
gain
more
fate
over
the
course
of
the
game
but
these
are
built
into
the
game
mechanics
unrelated
to
holdings

In
addition
you
are
now
able
to
carryover
excess
fate
into
future
rounds
rewarding
you
for
choosing
to
save
some
of
your
fate
in
order
to
have
more
flexible
options
in
the
future

l
c

png
The
Fate
Phase
Unlike
in
the
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
CCG
your
characters
no
longer
remain
in
play
indefinitely
unless
removed
by
a
card
effect


Instead
when
you
play
a
character
from
your
province
or
your
conflict
hand
you
may
choose
to
place
any
number
of
additional
fate
tokens
on
it
from
your
supply
of
fate

During
the
fate
phase
at
the
end
of
each
round
one
of
these
fate
tokens
will
be
removed
or
if
the
character
has
no
fate
tokens
the
character
will
be
discarded

For
more
information
on
the
fate
phase
read
the
Embrace
Your
Fate
section

on
this
page

Honor
Honor
plays
a
significant
role
in
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
but
fundamentally
honor
effects
are
tied
to
conflicts

You
will
need
to
engage
in
conflicts
if
you
re
planning
to
advance
your
agenda
whether
you
re
attempting
to
increase
your
own
honor
or
dishonor
your
opponent

In
addition
a
character
s
status
as
honored
or
dishonored
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
its
military
and
political
skill

An
honored
character
adds
its
glory
to
its
military
and
political
skills
while
a
dishonored
character
subtracts
its
glory
from
its
military
and
political
skills

Dueling
Mechanics
for
dueling
are
present
in
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
but
it
will
function
completely
differently
than
in
the
collectible
card
game

What
is
happening
with
the
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
storyline
It
is
an
era
of
sudden
change
and
upheaval
in
the
Emerald
Empire

Mortal
schemes
elemental
imbalances
and
celestial
turmoil
have
disrupted
the
political
military
and
spiritual
equilibrium
of
Rokugan

Long
simmering
rivalries
and
fresh
betrayals
ripple
through
the
courts
and
on
the
battlefield

The
Chrysanthemum
Throne
is
beset
by
threats
from
without
and
within
and
the
honor
of
the
seven
Great
Clans
shall
be
put
to
the
test

After
a
devastating
tsunami
strikes
their
coastal
farmland
the
Crane
Clan
balances
on
the
precipice
of
famine
and
war

Doji
Hotaru

is
the
trusted
friend
Emperor
Hantei
XXXVIII
while
his
impossibly
beautiful
wife
Kachiko
serves
as
the
Emperor
s
Imperial
Advisor

No
word
is
whispered
in
the
Imperial
Capital
that
escapes
the
Scorpion
Clan
s
ears
and
no
plot
is
hatched
that
evades
the
notice
of
its
agents

The
Scorpion
maintain
a
tenuous
alliance
with
the
Lion
Clan

leader
Akodo

seeks
to
carry
out
an
age
old
vendetta
against
the
Crane
at
the
side
of
his

disquiet
