the

putting

she
was
at

are

what
about
Roger

transformed
an
entire
sport
with
his

his

on

his
blazing

He
won

Rafael

ranking

wasn

it

was
fun

Twenty

ago
the

ranked
the

North
American
athletes
of
the
th
century

Michael
Jordan
came
in
first
followed
by
Babe
Ruth

Jim

and
Wayne

Ruth
should
have
been
No

but

so
many

over

we
thought
it
was
time
to
do
another

I

you
there

this

In
considering
the
best
athletes
of
the

however
we
have
expanded
our
choices
beyond
North
America

ESPN
editions
from
around
the

contributed
to
the
nominations
and
voting
process
as
well
as
the
individual
sport
list
rankings
that
will
follow

Voters
were
instructed
to
consider
only
an
athlete
s
performance
since


So
for
Barry
Bonds
He
won
seven
MVP
awards
but
only
four
of
those
came
after
as
did
of
his
home
runs

Or
Ken
Griffey
Jr

He
played
until
but
all
of
his
best
seasons
came
in
the
s

Tiger
won
of
his
majors
from
on
so
he
s
in
good
shape

Other
athletes
such
as
Patrick
Mahomes
or
Nikola
Jokic
or
Shohei
Ohtani
obviously
have
more
greatness
ahead
of
them
so
we
ll
see
how
high
their
accomplishments
so
far
get
them
on

There
is
little
that
Williams
didn

achieve
during
her
record
setting
career
including
winning
major
titles

But
it
might
have
been
her
last
one
that
was
the
most
improbable

She
needed
to
win
one

to
break

with
Steffi
Graf
for
most
in
the
Open
era
which
began
in

Williams
said
she
had
been
chasing
for
a
really
long
time
and
remained
in
the
Australian
Open
draw
even
after
finding
out
she
was
pregnant
shortly
before
competition
began

She
was
in
peak
Serena
form
never
dropping
a
set
en
route
to
a

with
her
sister
Venus

She
defeated
Venus
to

of

record

Williams
played
in
four
more

finals
after
her
return
from
maternity

and
a
complicated
childbirth

She
didn

win
another
title

The

I
see
it
I
should
have
had

Williams
wrote
in

in

the

Cavaliers
in

Game

The

game
was
a

performance
that
stands
as
one
of
the
classic
games
of
this
century




and
it
probably
doesn
t
even
rank
in
the
top
of
James
playoff
performances

It
might
not
be
one
of
his
top
three
conference
finals
games

This
is
what
James
greatness
rests
on
No
one
has
ever
been
this
good
for
this
long

That
long
ago
night
in
the
Palace
of
Auburn
Hills
is
merely
one
of
point
games
James
has
in
the
playoffs
alone

That
win
paved
the
way
to
his
first
Finals
starting
a
run
of
appearances
in
years

During
that
stretch
he
won
four
NBA
titles
four
MVPs
and
four
Finals
MVPs
with
three
different
teams
as
well
as
two
Olympic
gold
medals

He
also
won
at
least
one
road
game
in
consecutive
playoff
series

He
has
scored
in
double
figures
in
consecutive
regular
season
games
the
last
time
he
didn
t
his
son
Bronny
now
his
Laker
teammate
was
years
old

Volume
isn
t
a
vogue
way
to
measure
achievement
in
the
NBA
anymore
and
it
lends
credence
to
those
who
want
to
push
James
down
all
time
lists

It
s
the
only
side
of
the
argument
to
take
against
James
who
has
essentially
renamed
the

record

for
himself

was

seven
Super

rings
was
his
favorite
he
was
fond
of
answering
The
next
one

That
sums
up
the
player
whom
Bill
Belichick
referred
to
as
the
ultimate
winner
who
often
played
his
best
when
the
stakes
were
highest

Belichick
noted
how
Brady
entered
the
NFL
as
a
sixth
round
pick
with
little
to
no
fanfare
and
left
as
the
most
successful
player
in
league
history

Said
Belichick
His
relentless
pursuit
of
excellence
drove
him
on
a
daily
basis

His
work
ethic
and
desire
to
win
were
both
motivational
and
inspirational
to
teammates
and
coaches
alike

It

for

professional
athlete
to
feel
emotional
during

game
before
retiring

But
what
is
unusual
is
when
everyone
else
in

competition
is
equally
emotional
about
it

Such
was
the
case
for
Federer
during
the
last

at
the
Laver
Cup
an
event
he
co
founded
in


Having

Only

Trout
leaped

As
perhaps
the
first

whose
greatness
was
sharpened
by

Trout

was
on

from

if

the

could

On

Shiffrin
chased
down
a
record
that
for
years
consumed
the
minds
and
careers
of
countless
ski
racers
and
became
the
winningest
alpine
skier
in

She
won

that
day
eclipsing
the
longstanding
record
held
by
Swedish
legend
Ingemar
Stenmark
which
many
considered
to
be
unbreakable

She
did
it
of

quickly
reaching

nearly
three
years
quicker
than
Stenmark
and
by
winning
at

one
race
in

the
only
woman
or

ever
to
do

But
what

about

that
she

As
the

Ortiz

Cooperstown

a

that

He

over

That
includes
when

he
went
for
with
two
homers
and
eight
walks
in
the
Fall
Classic
against
a
St

Key
accomplishments
Seven
time
NASCAR
Cup
Series
champion
tied
for
most
all
time
with
Dale
Earnhardt
and
Richard
Petty
only
driver
to
win
five
straight
titles


The
challenge
when
it
comes
to
covering
Johnson
s
career
is
having
to
continuously
find
new
ways
to
express
Hey
y
all
this
guy
he
s
really
great
at
racing
stock
cars
isn
t
he
And
that
s
only
the
second
best
compliment
I
can
give
to
the
man
who
won
seven
NASCAR
Cup
Series
titles
equaling
Richard
Petty
and
Dale
Earnhardt
including
five
in
a
row
a
mark
of
which
The
King
and
The
Intimidator
never
came
close

But
Johnson
s
most
mind
bending
accomplishment
is
that
he
won
those
Cups
even
as
the
system
that
awarded
them
was
seemingly
and
repeatedly
rigged
against
him

The
paddock
called
it
Jimmie
Proofing
as
his
septet
of
titles
were
earned
via
three
different
points
systems
and
four
postseason
format
variations
all
while
steering
three
wildly
different
generations
of
race
cars

Meanwhile
he
somehow
has
remained
true
to
his
SoCal
desert
town
trailer
park
roots
as
kind
and
humble
as
he
was
fast

unbeatable

But
his
most
amazing
feat
is
undoubtedly
going
the
whole

unbeaten

in


He
was
outstanding
in
that
campaign
leading
his
team
to
an
achievement
never
repeated
since
in
modern
English
football

I
believe
Thierry
was
on
the
same
level
as

definitely

He
was
an
exceptional
football
player
but
as
well

There
isn

a
player
in

who
has
commanded
a
slap
shot
like
Ovechkin
in

career

Even
if
Father
Time
has
begun
catching
up
in
some
areas
the
pure
power
behind
his
signature
shot
remains

Ovechkin
s
success
scoring
goals
to
date
has
come
in
large
part
because
of
how
he
uses
a
big
frame
foot
to
add
velocity
and
power
behind
a
shot
that
can
exceed
mph

When
Ovechkin
puts
his
weight
behind
a
puck
particularly
from
his
favorite
right
circle
spot
it
s
a
howitzer
for
any
goalie
to

The

running

at

and
able
to
slow
down
keep
his
head
still
and
shoot
at

with

precision

All
of
these
virtues
were
best
seen
in
the
th
century
but
the
st
came
up
with
the
best
storyline

Twice
his
knee
collapsed
beneath

and
he
was
left
howling
in
gruesome
pain

Many
thought
the

In

to
the

Inter
Milan
his
Italian

not

Brazil

he
took
the

carrying
a

qualify
