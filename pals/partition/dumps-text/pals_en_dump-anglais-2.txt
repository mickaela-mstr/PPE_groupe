In
this
painting
of
Lady
Godiva
by
John
Collier
the
authentic
historical
person
is
fully
submerged
in
the
legend
presented
in
an
anachronistic
high
medieval
setting

A
legend
is
a
genre
of
folklore
that
consists
of
a
narrative
featuring
human
actions
believed
or
perceived
to
have
taken
place
in
human
history

Narratives
in
this
genre
may
demonstrate
human
values
and
possess
certain
qualities
that
give
the
tale
verisimilitude

Legend
for
its
active
and
passive
participants
may
include
miracles

Legends
may
be
transformed
over
time
to
keep
them
fresh
and
vital

Many
legends
operate
within
the
realm
of
uncertainty
never
being
entirely
believed
by
the
participants
but
also
never
being
resolutely
doubted

Legends
are
sometimes
distinguished
from
myths
in
that
they
concern
human
beings
as
the
main
characters
and
do
not
necessarily
have
supernatural
origins
and
sometimes
in
that
they
have
some
sort
of
historical
basis
whereas
myths
generally
do
not

The
Brothers
Grimm
defined
legend
as
folktale
historically
grounded


A
by
product
of
the
concern
with
human
beings
is
the
long
list
of
legendary
creatures
leaving
no
resolute
doubt
that
legends
are
historically
grounded

A
modern
folklorist
s
professional
definition
of
legend
was
proposed
by
Timothy
R

Tangherlini
in
Legend
typically
is
a
short
mono
episodic
traditional
highly
ecotypified
historicized
narrative
performed
in
a
conversational
mode
reflecting
on
a
psychological
level
a
symbolic
representation
of
folk
belief
and
collective
experiences
and
serving
as
a
reaffirmation
of
commonly
held
values
of
the
group
to
whose
tradition
it
belongs

Etymology
and
origin
edit

Holger
danske

Holger
Danske
a
legendary
character
Legend
is
a
loanword
from
Old
French
that
entered
English
usage
c



The
Old
French
noun
legende
derives
from
the
Medieval
Latin
legenda

In
its
early
English
language
usage
the
word
indicated
a
narrative
of
an
event

The
word
legendary
was
originally
a
noun
introduced
in
the
s
meaning
a
collection
or
corpus
of
legends

This
word
changed
to
legendry
and
legendary
became
the
adjectival
form

By
English
speaking
Protestants
began
to
use
the
word
when
they
wished
to
imply
that
an
event
especially
the
story
of
any
saint
not
acknowledged
in
John
Foxe
s
Actes
and
Monuments
was
fictitious

Thus
legend
gained
its
modern
connotations
of
undocumented
and
spurious
which
distinguish
it
from
the
meaning
of
chronicle

In
Jacob
Grimm
described
the
fairy
tale
as
poetic
legend
historic

Early
scholars
such
as
Karl
Wehrhan
de
Friedrich
Ranke
and
Will
Erich
Peuckert
followed
Grimm
s
example
in
focussing
solely
on
the
literary
narrative
an
approach
that
was
enriched
particularly
after
the
s
by
addressing
questions
of
performance
and
the
anthropological
and
psychological
insights
provided
in
considering
legends
social
context

Questions
of
categorising
legends
in
hopes
of
compiling
a
content
based
series
of
categories
on
the
line
of
the
Aarne
Thompson
folktale
index
provoked
a
search
for
a
broader
new
synthesis

In
an
early
attempt
at
defining
some
basic
questions
operative
in
examining
folk
tales
Friedrich
Ranke
de
in
characterised
the
folk
legend
as
a
popular
narrative
with
an
objectively
untrue
imaginary
content
a
dismissive
position
that
was
subsequently
largely
abandoned

Compared
to
the
highly
structured
folktale
legend
is
comparatively
amorphous
Helmut
de
Boor
noted
in


The
narrative
content
of
legend
is
in
realistic
mode
rather
than
the
wry
irony
of
folktale
Wilhelm
Heiske
remarked
on
the
similarity
of
motifs
in
legend
and
folktale
and
concluded
that
in
spite
of
its
realistic
mode
legend
is
not
more
historical
than
folktale

In
Einleitung
in
der
Geschichtswissenschaft
Ernst
Bernheim
asserted
that
a
legend
is
simply
a
longstanding
rumour

Gordon
Allport
credited
the
staying
power
of
some
rumours
to
the
persistent
cultural
state
of
mind
that
they
embody
and
capsulise
thus
Urban
legends
are
a
feature
of
rumour

When
Willian
Hugh
Jansen
suggested
that
legends
that
disappear
quickly
were
short
term
legends
and
the
persistent
ones
be
termed
long
term
legends
the
distinction
between
legend
and
rumour
was
effectively
obliterated
Tangherlini
concluded

Christian
legenda
edit
Main
article
Legendary
hagiography
In
a
narrow
Christian
sense
legenda
things
to
be
read
on
a
certain
day
in
church
were
hagiographical
accounts
often
collected
in
a
legendary

Because
saints
lives
are
often
included
in
many
miracle
stories
legend
in
a
wider
sense
came
to
refer
to
any
story
that
is
set
in
a
historical
context
but
that
contains
supernatural
divine
or
fantastic
elements

Oral
tradition
edit
Main
article
Oral
tradition
History
preserved
orally
through
many

often
takes

a
more

oral
traditions
of
the
African
Great

The

on
the
other
hand
has
of
necessity
some
historical
or
topographical
connection

It
refers
imaginary
events
to
some
real
personage
or
it
localizes
romantic
stories
in
some
definite
spot

From
the
moment
a
legend
is
retold
as
fiction
its
authentic
legendary
qualities
begin
to
fade
and
recede
in
The
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollow
Washington
Irving
transformed
a
local
Hudson
River
Valley
legend
into
a
literary
anecdote
with
Gothic
overtones
which
actually
tended
to
diminish
its
character
as
genuine
legend

Stories
that
exceed
the
boundaries
of
realism
are
called
fables


For
example
the
talking
animal
formula
of
Aesop
identifies
his
brief
stories
as
fables
and
not
legends

The
parable
of
the
Prodigal
Son
would
be
a
legend
if
it
were
told
as
having
actually
happened
to
a
specific
son
of
a
historical
father

If
it
included
a
donkey
that
gave
sage
advice
to
the
Prodigal
Son
it
would
be
a
fable

Urban
legends
are
a
modern
genre
of
folklore
that
is
rooted
in
local
popular
culture
usually
comprising
fictional
stories
that
are
often
presented
as
true
with
macabre
or
humorous
elements

These
legends
can
be
used
for
entertainment
purposes
as
well
as
semi
serious
explanations
for
seemingly
mysterious
events
such
as
disappearances
and
strange
objects

The
term
urban
legend
as
generally
used
by
folklorists
has
appeared
in
print
since
at
least


Jan
Harold
Brunvand
professor
of
English
at
the
University
of
Utah
introduced
the
term
to
the
general
public
in
a
series
of
popular
books
published
beginning
in


Brunvand
used
his
collection
of
legends
The
Vanishing
Hitchhiker
American
Urban
Legends
Their
Meanings
to
make
two
points
first
that
legends
and
folklore
do
not
occur
exclusively
in
so
called
primitive
or
traditional
societies
and
second
that
one
could
learn
much
about
urban
and
modern
culture
by
studying
such
tales

of

handed
down
through
popular

usually
consisting
of
an
exaggerated
or

account
of
some

historical

often
a
saint
monarch
or
popular
hero

Legends

theology
and
ritual

Their
main
characters
are
not
usually
human
beings
but
they
often
have
human
attributes
they
are
animals
deities
or
culture
heroes
whose
actions
are
set
in
an
earlier
world
when
the
earth
was
different
from
what
it
is
today
or
in
another
world
such
as
the
sky
or

Legends
are
more
often
secular
than

and
their

characters
are

They
tell
of

deeds
of

heroes
chiefs
