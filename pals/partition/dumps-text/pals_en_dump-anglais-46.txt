Tell
Me
A
Story
is
a
monthly
column
in
which
I
examine
the
storytelling
elements
of
specific
video
games

A
little
over
ten
years
ago
when
the
Gamecube
was
in
its
infancy
Nintendo
unveiled
to
the
world
a
tech
demo
for
a
project
titled
The
Legend
of
Zelda


The
demo
featured
a
realistically
styled
battle
between
Link
and
his
eternal
nemesis
Ganon
rendered
artfully
in
real
time

While
the
company
offered
no
official
word
on
the
nature
of
demo
media
speculation
ran
rampant

IGN
went
so
far
as
to
flout
the
demo
as
absolutely
everything
we
could
have
hoped
for
in
a
Gamecube
Zelda
title

A
year
later
the
dark
demo
was
replaced
by
a
cel
shaded
one
with
a
whimsical
cartoon
style
a
radically
different
product
from
demo


When
the
final
product
was
released
it
wasn
t
the
sober
gritty
game
intimated
by
The
Legend
of
Zelda


This
was
the
new
cartoon
version
complete
with
cheery
overtones
and
a
stunningly
bright
color
palette

In
hopes
of
extending
Zelda
s
reach
to
all
ages
in
the
words
of
Shigeru
Miyamoto
the
company
released
The
Legend
of
Zelda
The
Wind
Waker
in
December
of


Nearly
ten
years
have
passed
and
since
then
Zelda
s
black
sheep
has
shaken
off
its
initially
accrued
confusion
in
favor
of
a
seat
deep
in
the
heart
of
franchise
fans

Warning
spoilers
ahead

My
most
recent
playthrough
of
the
game
involved
a
dear
friend
who
grew
up
on
the
series
myself
and
my
hard
to
impress
baby
brother
who
would
rather
teabag
his
friends
in
Call
of
Duty
than
participate
in
some
boring
single
player
story
game

Before
we
even
got
around
to
rescuing
Link
s
sister
there
were
Hearts
dancing
in
his
eyes

Personal
anecdotes
aside
after
a
little
under
a
decade
of
existence
The
Wind
Waker
has
proven
to
be
more
iconic
and
classic
than
originally
thought

The
Legend
of
Zelda
Symphony
of
the
Goddess
arrangements
feature
an
entire
suite
dedicated
to
the
game
s
Celtic
rooted
music

Toon
Link
s
sweet
little
mug
graces
Super
Smash
Bros

What
Zelda
fan
doesn
t
recognize
the
chiming
sound
of
that
infamous
baton
echoing
the
rhythms
of
the
wind
Or
better
yet
the
riff
played
when
Tetra
winks
The
story
is
not
your
typical
Zelda
fare
probably
because
the
game
s
aesthetic
is
one
of
wind
and
water
rather
than
the
elements
at
large

Players
spend
an
amount
of
time
bordering
on
inordinate
but
still
fun
sailing
between
islands
tendrils
of
cartoon
drawn
wind
pushing
at
your
sail

Link
s
trips
across
the
waters
are
frequent
and
mastering
long
range
weapons
for
naval
combat
is
a
necessity

For
the
first
time
since
A
Link
to
the
Past
Link
has
a
family

The
presence
of
Link
s
grandmother
and
little
sister
Aryll
raises
the
stakes

Link
has
a
home
to
come
back
to
a
home
filled
with
people

Unlike
previous
Links
who
have
abandoned
friends
and
bachelor
households
for
the
sake
of
his
quest
this
Link
has
a
base
that
is
both
a
personal
strength
and
liability

While
he
has
his
family
as
a
reason
to
fight
the
good
fight
his
grandmother
and
sister
also
present
a
terrible
liability
for
our
hero
jeopardizing
their
safety
is
an
emotional
weakness
for
Link
who
must
ultimately
save
them

This
becomes
crystal
clear
when
Aryll
is
kidnapped
within
the
first
thirty
minutes
of
the
game

The
legend
passed
down
is
the
story
of
Ocarina
of
Time
a
boy
in
green
defeats
Ganon
and
the
world
becomes
the
Great
Sea

Ganon
s
presence
creeps
back
into
the
world
and
while
none
on
Link
s
homeland
of
Outset
Island
know
what
became
of
the
fabled
Kingdom
of
Hyrule
they
do
know
that
the
boy
in
green
the
Hero
of
Time
did
not
appear
to
save
them
once
more

In
tradition
with
this
legend
the
boys
of
Outset
Island
dress
in
green
when
they
come
of
age

This
method
of
introducing
Link
s
classic
green
tunic
with
a
history
and
purpose
behind
it
echoed
in
the
knighting
ceremony
of
Skyward
Sword
is
a
heart
warming
sign
that
the
player
is
controlling
a
boy
who
is
just
beginning
to
grow
up

This
spins
a
thread
of
the
old
coming
of
age
trope
through
The
Wind
Waker

Link
changes
internally
as
he
leaves
his
mark
on
the
world
around
him
developing
a
sense
of
his
responsibilities
in
this
fantasy
hyperbole
of
maturation

Zelda
s
hold
on
the
game
is
tenuous
at
best
until
her
reveal
much
later
on
but
there
is
still
a
young
lady
in
the
middle
of
the
action

The
mysterious
unattainable
woman
that
has
traditionally
been
Princess
Zelda
is
replaced
by
not
one
but
two
very
real
women
Aryll
and
Tetra

Aryll
s
kidnapping
is
the
impetus
for
Link
to
venture
out
with
Tetra
and
Tetra
s
allure
as
the
tomboyish
charming
pirate
captain
is
hard
to
ignore

Aryll
is
the
delicate
helpless
princess
that
Tetra
will
never
be
Tetra
who
even
after
her
awakening
as
a
descendant
of
Zelda
retains
the
same
air
of
brazen
strength
about
her

These
two
women
girls
really
serve
as
foils
to
each
other

Sweet
Aryll
drives
Link
to
action
and
keeps
him
moving
forward
through
the
power
of
their
sibling
bond

Tetra
challenges
Link
goading
him
further
by
asserting
her
dominance
and
superiority

Her
initial
distrust
of
our
blonde
haired
hero
gives
him
the
motivation
to
persevere
to
prove
his
own
value

Whereas
past
Zeldas
give
Link
their
immediate
trust
and
faith
Tetra
s
must
be
earned

Stealing
bombs
from
her
own
ship
and
seeking
to
rescue
Aryll
himself
spark
her
interest
and
as
she
closely
observes
him
via
the
Pirate
s
Charm
she
begins
to
warm
up
to
the
idea
that
there
is
more
to
Link
than
he
outwardly
demonstrates

The
evolution
of
Tetra
s
trust
in
Link
adds
to
the
coming
of
age
motif
and
a
deeper
element
to
their
relationship

This
is
not
a
princess
in
a
dungeon
pouring
her
hope
into
the
hero
this
is
a
smart
careful
woman
pushing
Link
to
earn
her
favor

Earning
Tetra
s
respect
is
earning
the
blessing
of
the
princess
and
ultimately
her
awakening

Tetra
like
Link
is
still
very
young
but
has
enough
of
a
commanding
presence
to
captain
a
band
of
grown
men

Zeldas
are
normally
sweet
demure
and
the
picture
of
the
untouchable
princess
on
her
pedestal

Tetra
breaks
this
mold
and
in
taking
Zelda
off
her
pedestal
and
placing
her
out
in
the
open
she
becomes
a
character
that
we
can
interact
with
on
a
deeper
level
there
is
no
sugar
coating
she
is
a
real
and
ordinary
woman
for
a
majority
of
the
game

Once
her
ancestry
is
revealed
Link
continues
to
fight
for
and
alongside
her
but
the
more
you
know
the
more
you
care
and
the
player
can
t
help
but
become
deeply
attached
to
Tetra
in
a
way
that
is
radically
different
from
their
attachment
to
Princess
Zelda

The
attachment
is
to
a
real
girl
and
there
are
no
preconceived
notions
about
how
breathtakingly
wonderful
she
is
or
how
sweet
and
how
angelic

This
Zelda
is
not
a
goddess
incarnate
she
is
a
woman
with
flaws
pride
and
a
snarky
temper
most
notably
that
is
more
easily
relatable

The
Wind
Waker
cannot
be
brought
up
without
discussing
the
boat

The
King
of
Red
Lions
is
The
Wind
Waker
s
answer
to
Navi
and
Tatl
and
to
an
extent
Epona

Link
cannot
bring
the
boat
onto
dry
land
therefore
forcing
the
player
to
think
through
puzzles
without
their
trigger
finger
on
the
hint
button

Removing
Link
s
faithful
companion
from
most
of
the
puzzles
he
must
solve
forces
the
player
to
think
a
little
harder

The
Wind
Waker
is
deeply
tied
to
Ocarina
of
Time
both
in
its
legendary
and
historical
tradition
and
in
its
presentation

Knowledge
of
Ocarina
while
not
necessary
to
understand
Wind
Waker
enriches
certain
parts
of
the
game

For
example
the
castle
in
Hyrule
displays
seven
stained
glass
windows
each
bearing
an
image
of
a
sage
from
Ocarina

Both
physically
and
plot
wise
the
story
is
driven
by
wind

Wind
is
what
guides
the
King
of
Red
Lions
over
the
waves
and
often
is
what
you
need
to
solve
certain
puzzles

There
is
a
heavy
Celtic
aesthetic
to
The
Wind
Waker
and
in
Celtic
lore
wind
is
more
closely
synonymous
with
the
element
of
spirit

The
wind
is
the
spirit
of
the
game
the
only
primary
element
capable
of
overcoming
water
use
of
the
Wind
Waker
is
the
only
way
to
navigate
and
conquer
the
seemingly
endless
Great
Sea

The
Wind
Waker
also
carries
a
hefty
amount
of
literary
tradition
on
its
shoulders

Like
Odysseus
of
The
Odyssey
Link
must
battle
his
way
through
storms
from
island
to
island
acquaint
himself
with
strange
new
races
and
take
down
mythical
beasts

Without
directly
referencing
the
story
characters
such
as
the
Master
of
the
Winds
the
Greek
god
Aeolis
are
taken
directly
from
the
epic

Link
s
journey
to
retrieve
the
Triforce
smacks
of
Jason
and
the
Argonauts

As
he
defeats
monsters
forges
alliances
and
awakens
sages
to
his
aid
and
goblins
to
his
wrath
Link
grows
to
become
a
legendary
hero
much
like
Jason

The
Celtic
influence
coupled
with
its
cartoonish
art
style
creates
an
atmosphere
akin
to
that
of
unveiling
an
ancient
story
or
legend

Like
the
legend
the
people
of
Outset
Island
pass
among
themselves
the
player
is
being
passed
the
story
of
this
Link
the
Hero
of
the
Winds
who
could
conduct
air
and
bend
it
to
his
will

The
vivid
color
palette
and
rounded
almost
over
exaggerated
shapes
and
shading
presents
a
moving
storybook
a
gorgeous
foray
into
what
a
child
s
imagination
must
look
like

The
player
is
watching
a
new
story
a
new
history
unfold
and
the
art
style
reflects
the
wide
eyed
sense
of
wonder
we
are
meant
to
experience

As
always
Link
provides
enough
of
a
blank
slate
on
which
to
project
ourselves
and
make
our
own
decisions
in
game
progression
but
to
an
extent
the
production
team
has
wanted
us
to
feel
like
the
start
struck
children
Nintendo
hoped
to
reach
out
to
with
The
Wind
Waker

Nintendo
has
integrated
storytelling
elements
into
the
actual
functionality
of
the
game

A
significant
amount
of
time
is
spent
sailing
between
islands
battling
creatures
that
swim
and
ride
cyclones
along
the
way

This
allows
the
game
to
mask
its
loading
times
by
rendering
the
data
as
the
player
approaches
the
island

Use
of
the
Wind
Waker
changes
the
direction
of
the
wind

In
order
to
discover
or
unlock
certain
islands
Link
must
search
for
map
pieces
including
the
eight
TriForce
charts
that
he
must
decode

If
the
player
is
taking
too
long
to
figure
out
a
course
of
action
be
it
on
a
random
small
island
or
in
the
middle
of
a
dungeon
Link
s
big
expressive
cartoon
eyes
will
often
look
in
the
direction
you
need
to
go

But
perhaps
the
most
tantalizing
element
from
The
Wind
Waker
is
its
particular
incarnation
of
Ganon

Wielding
dual
swords
this
Ganon
towers
high
over
Link
hiding
in
the
Forbidden
Fortress
and
abducting
girls
in
hopes
that
one
of
them
may
be
Zelda

As
he
tells
Link
the
wind
in
his
homeland
always
brought
death
a
sharp
contrast
to
the
guiding
wind
of
the
Great
Sea

Ganon
coveted
this
wind
which
is
the
same
peaceful
wind
that
blew
over
Hyrule

He
sought
the
Triforce
in
order
to
fulfill
his
wish
to
expose
Hyrule
to
the
sun
so
that
he
may
conquer
it

Ganon
seeks
to
conquer
Hyrule
because
he
desires
freedom
from
destruction
he
seeks
to
destroy
so
that
he
may
find
peace

He
may
be
maniacal
and
extreme
in
his
ways
but
Ganon
only
wants
to
tame
a
wind
that
nurtures
rather
than
kills
though
he
will
kill
for
it

Before
the
battle
with
Puppet
Ganon
he
tells
Link
and
Tetra
So
many
pathetic
creatures
scattered
across
a
handful
of
islands
drifting
on
this
sea
like
fallen
leaves
on
a
forgotten
pool



What
can
they
possibly
hope
to
achieve
Don
t
you
see
All
of
you



Your
gods
destroyed
you
Like
the
Great
Flood
of
the
Bible
the
land
and
its
people
were
washed
away
by
the
gods
desire
to
hit
the
reset
button
to
seal
an
evil
entity
for
which
they
were
running
out
of
options
to
combat

Ganon
is
a
realist
he
isn
t
spinning
stories
he
is
telling
it
like
it
is
from
the
viewpoint
of
someone
who
has
been
raised
in
a
life
of
hardship

You
can
t
help
by
sympathize
with
Ganon
or
at
least
feel
a
little
sorry
for
his
predicament

A
man
from
a
far
off
country
which
by
the
look
of
his
clothes
may
be
Asia
has
traveled
the
world
to
attract
the
attention
of
a
new
set
of
gods
and
to
seek
a
more
comforting
wind
or
spirit
if
you
ve
been
keeping
up
with
the
Celtic
undertones

His
final
speech
is
poignant
powerful
and
sad



Actually
I
ll
let
Ganon
tell
you
himself

The
man
s
last
words
are
a
cry
out
to
whatever
gods
are
listening
from
his
homeland
or
Hyrule

As
he
feels
his
own
spirit
leave
his
body
he
sighs
The
wind



it
is
blowing



A
colorful
cast
of
characters
and
an
even
brighter
design
make
The
Legend
of
Zelda
The
Wind
Waker
a
real
treat
for
gamers
for
both
hardcore
and
casual
Zelda
fans

A
break
in
the
traditional
mold
Nintendo
has
set
for
the
series
The
Wind
Waker
is
a
refreshing
breath
of
air
a
treat
of
a
game
with
hidden
depth
beneath
its
main
quest

The
game
builds
on
what
Ocarina
of
Time
and
Majora
s
Mask
have
already
established
but
with
the
added
twist
of
unique
artistic
style
and
a
foundation
built
on
an
ancient
culture
deeply
invested
in
its
legends
and
spirituality

The
game
presents
a
story
that
is
both
fun
and
heart
warming
light
and
dark
proving
that
legends
and
fantastic
tales
are
not
just
for
children
but
those
of
all
ages
