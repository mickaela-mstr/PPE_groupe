The

and

of

The

career
and

Plot
edit
In
the
s
Reggie
Kray
is
a
former
boxer
who
has
become
an
important
part
of
the
criminal
underground
in
London

At
the
start
of
the
film
his
twin
brother
Ron
is
locked
up
in
a
psychiatric
hospital
for
paranoid
schizophrenia

Reggie
uses
threats
to
obtain
the
premature
release
of
his
brother

The
twins
unite
their
efforts
to
control
a
large
part
of
London
s
criminal
underworld
made
easier
when
the
head
of
the
south
London
Richardson
Gang
a
k
a

the
Torture
Gang
is
imprisoned

One
of
their
first
efforts
is
to
muscle
in
on
the
control
of
a
local
nightclub
using
extortion
and
brutal
violence

Reg
enters
into
a
relationship
with
Frances
his
driver
s
sister
whom
he
eventually
marries

When
he
is
imprisoned
for
a
previous
criminal
conviction
which
he
cannot
evade
she
makes
him
swear
that
he
will
leave
his
criminal
life
behind
an
oath
he
never
honours
owing
to
the
allure
of
crime

While
Reg
is
in
prison
Ron
s
mental
instability
and
violent
temperament
lead
to
severe
financial
setbacks
at
the
nightclub
and
it
is
almost
forced
to
close
after
Ron
scares
away
most
of
the
customers

On
the
first
night
after
Reg
s
release
from
prison
the
brothers
have
an
all
out
fist
fight
but
they
manage
to
patch
things
up
at
least
partially

The
brothers
are
approached
by
Angelo
Bruno
of
the
Philadelphia
crime
family
who
on
behalf
of
Meyer
Lansky
and
the
American
Mafia
wants
to
engage
them
in
a
crime
syndicate
deal

Bruno
agrees
to
a
fifty
fifty
deal
with
Reg
to
split
London
s
underground
gambling
profits
in
exchange
for
local
protection
by
the
brothers

Initially
this
system
is
highly
lucrative
for
the
Kray
brothers
however
Ron
s
paranoia
and
inclination
towards
violence
causes
problems
for
Reg
s
efforts
to
maintain
control

Ron
s
barely
concealed
volatility
results
in
him
publicly
murdering
George
Cornell
an
associate
of
the
Torture
Gang

As
a
result
Scotland
Yard
opens
a
full
investigation
of
the
Kray
brothers

Reg
s
marriage
with
Frances
crumbles
owing
to
his
addiction
to
crime

Unable
to
bear
Reg
s
false
promises
to
reform
Frances
starts
consuming
prescription
drugs
illegally

After
he
beats
and
rapes
her
in
a
fit
of
rage
she
leaves
him

When
Reg
approaches
her
to
reconcile
Frances
seems
to
agree
and
they
plan
to
visit
Ibiza
but
she
kills
herself
with
a
drug
overdose
leaving
Reg
ridden
with
guilt

The
twins
criminal
activities
continue
and
Ron
pays
petty
criminal
Jack
the
Hat
McVitie
to
kill
Leslie
Payne
Reg
s
partner
who
controls
the
legal
side
of
the
Krays
operations
as
he
does
not
trust
Payne

Jack
only
wounds
Payne
who
then
turns
the
brothers
over
to
Detective
Superintendent
Leonard
Nipper
Read
the
head
of
the
investigation

Reg
finds
out
and
brutally
stabs
McVitie
with
a
knife
during
a
party
hosted
by
Ron

The
testimony
given
by
Payne
means
that
Ron
is
arrested
and
charged
with
Cornell
s
murder

The
final
scene
shows
a
police
squad
breaking
down
the
door
to
Reggie
s
flat
in
order
to
apprehend
him
for
McVitie
s
murder

The
closing
captions
indicate
both
brothers
receiving
criminal
convictions
for
murder

They
died
five
years
apart
Ron
from
a
heart
attack
in
and
Reggie
from
bladder
cancer
in

Development
edit
On
October
it
was
announced
that
Brian
Helgeland
had
written
a
script
and
would
be
directing
a
film
focusing
on
the
life
of
Reggie
Kray
who
with
identical
brother
Ronald
formed
the
notorious
Kray
twins

Helgeland
said
the
film
would
concentrate
on
Reggie
s
attempts
to
control
the
psychopathic
tendencies
of
his
younger
twin

Helgeland
spoke
of
hanging
out
in
London
with
well
known
Krays
associate
Freddie
Foreman
saying
I
had
drinks
with
him
in
his
local
haunt

When
we
finished
he
got
up
to
go
and
they
feted
him
at
the
bar

I
said
to
him
what
about
the
bill
and
he
replied
we
don
t
pay

Helgeland
attended
the
Cannes
Film
Festival
with
Working
Title
s
Tim
Bevan
and
Chris
Clark
to
talk
to
potential
buyers
of
the

showing
test

Five
days
later
it
was
stated
that
Browning
was
in
negotiations
for
a
role
as
the
film
s
female
lead

Hardy
was
so
set
on
playing
Ronnie
Kray
that
he
proposed
to
Helgeland
that
if
he
gave
him
the
role
of
Ronnie
Hardy
would
play
the
role
of
Reggie
for
free

the
first
image

publicity
because

made
a
two
star
review
from
The

appear
to
be
at
least
a
four
star
review
by
placing
the
two
stars
between
the
heads
of
the
Krays
