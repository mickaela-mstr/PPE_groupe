Why

Arthurian
Legends
So
Popular
Source
It
is
wholly
possible
that
you
have
come
across
an
adaptation
of
Arthurian
legend
at
some
point
in
your
life

After
all
there
have
been
so
many
interpretations
across
varying
genres
and
media
that
an
entire
Wikipedia
page
has
been
dedicated
to
listing
them
all

One
of
the
most
well
known
works
includes
Sir
Thomas
Malory
s
Le
Morte
d
Arthur

It
has
been
deemed
the
most
extensive
and
culturally
important
work
based
on
Arthurian
legends

This
is
because
it
goes
in
depth
into
the
histories
of
many
characters
notably
the
more
prominent
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
and
Arthur
himself

Le
Morte
d
Arthur
has
inspired
other
great
works
such
as
T
H

White
s
The
Once
and
Future
King

Arthurian
legends
have
also
been
often
referenced
in
parodies
such
as
Monty
Python
and
the
third
Shrek
movie

With
all
these
different
retellings
of
Arthurian
legend
it
becomes
clear
that
they
are
widely
celebrated
even
within
pop
culture

That
leads
us
to
the
question
why
are
Arthurian
legends
so
popular
in
the
first
place
The
general
storyline
of
Arthurian
legends
goes
something
like
this
Arthur
guided
by
the
eccentric
wizard
Merlin
obtains
the
legendary
sword
Excalibur
and
becomes
King
of
Camelot

In
some
versions
he
acquires
the
sword
from
the
Lady
of
the
Lake

In
others
he
retrieves
the
sword
from
its
immovable
place
in
stone

He
then
held
court
in
Camelot
and
was
aided
by
the
many
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
his
rule
peaceful
and
prosperous

Eventually
King
Arthur
and
the
Knights
set
off
on
a
quest
to
find
the
immortality
granting
Holy
Grail

While
they
are
away
Lancelot
one
of
the
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
engages
in
adultery
with
Queen
Guinevere

An
enraged
King
Arthur
starts
a
civil
war
upon
receiving
word
of
the
affair

However
King
Arthur
s
rule
was
ultimately
brought
to
an
end
when
he
was
betrayed
by
the
Camelot
s
regent
Mordred
who
sought
to
seize
the
throne
for
himself

The
resulting
battle
ended
with
both
King
Arthur
and
Mordred
meeting
their
demise

After
his
death
King
Arthur
was
sent
on
a
boat
to
Avalon
where
he
is
presumed
to
remain
until
today

It
is
said
that
someday
when
Great
Britain
is
in
dire
need
King
Arthur
will
return
to
save
his
people

It
is
likely
that
Arthurian
legends
are
popular
due
to
its
character
archetypes
and
storytelling

Arthurian
legends
feature
characters
that
possess
distinct
personalities
or
capabilities
yet
still
leave
a
lot
of
room
open
for
interpretation

This
is
especially
the
case
for
characters
who
are
fan
favourites
including
Merlin
Morgan
le
Fay
and
Lancelot

There
are
retellings
centred
around
these
specific
characters

For
instance
BBC
s
Merlin
series
and
French
drama
Lancelot
du
Lac

Many
characters
in
Arthurian
legends
represent
beloved
archetypes
commonly
found
in
literature

As
an
example
King
Arthur
expectedly
falls
under
the
Hero
archetype

This
is
evident
through
his
tremendous
courage
and
dignity
making
him
the
perfect
example
of
chivalry

He
is
able
to
triumph
in
multiple
challenges
throughout
his
life
and
manages
to
ensure
peace
while
he
remains
King

Archetypes
can
also
be
easily
assigned
to
other
characters
in
Arthurian
legend

An
example
would
be
Merlin
who
falls
under
the
Mentor
archetype

Equipped
with
knowledge
and
magical
abilities
Merlin
acted
as
an
advisor
to
Arthur
as
he
was
growing
up
hence
becoming
a
great
influence
to
Arthur

The
Hero
and
Mentor
archetypes
as
well
as
styles
of
character
have
been
replicated
in
famous
works
for
example
Aragorn
and
Gandalf
respectively
from
J
R
R

Tolkien
s
Lord
of
the
Rings
trilogy

Character
tropes
are
still
commonly
used
in
the
realms
of
fiction
and
literature

They
are
viewed
as
incredibly
important
as
they
are
able
to
depict
particular
aspects
of
human
nature
and
life
thus
constructing
a
sense
of
familiarity
for
readers
or
the
audiences
of
a
variety
of
media

Another
reason
attributing
to
the
perseverance
of
archetypes
include
linking
the
current
text
to
established
identities
in
other
past
works
therefore
adding
supplementary
meaning
to
the
text

Consequently
it
is
not
exceptional
to
discover
that
numerous
characters
and
plots
resemble
or
overlap
with
that
of
Arthurian
legends
which
have
served
as
models
or
inspiration
for
later
works

Furthermore
Arthurian
legends
may
be
well
received
due
to
the
mystery
involved

There
is
no
definite
storyline
as
Arthurian
legends
are
pieced
together
from
a
number
of
different
sources

There
is
no
confirmation
on
which
version
is
the
original
adding
to
the
intrigue
revolving
around
the
tales

Arthur
s
birth
and
life
have
even
become
a
point
of
research
for
historians
while
some
scholars
claim
that
he
is
a
Celtic
deity
others
assume
that
he
was
a
real
person
of
Romano
Briton
origins

However
it
is
not
only
Arthur
that
is
subjected
to
such
ambiguity

The
characters
and
settings
surrounding
him
also
vary
in
terms
of
their
history
and
moral
alignment

Take
Morgan
le
Fay
for
example

She
is
portrayed
as
an
evil
sorceress
in
some
versions
but
is
shown
as
a
benevolent
healer
who
laid
Arthur
to
rest
at
Avalon

As
Arthurian
legends
are
known
to
end
on
a
cliffhanger
hence
Arthur
is
known
as
the
Once
and
Future
King
it
is
generally
agreed
upon
that
the
period
of
time
in
which
he
presumably
ruled
the
Golden
Age
has
passed
while
the
true
question
of
when
will
he
be
back
is
left
unanswered

The
obscurity
of
the
source
material
gives
artists
and
creators
the
freedom
to
come
up
with
their
own
versions
of
the
characters
and
the
story
based
on
their
own
takes
and
perspectives

The
temptations
of
filling
in
plot
holes
or
exploring
different
parts
of
Arthurian
legends
may
prove
to
be
too
alluring
to
withstand
for
storytellers

Apart
from
fiction
it
is
perhaps
because
we
know
so
much
yet
so
little
of
Arthurian
legends
that
academic
research
on
the
very
subject
is
still
carried
out
today

As
curator
Dr
ap
Huw
mentions
the
appeal
of
Arthur
is
that
he
was
or
is
whoever
you
want
him
to
be


Source
Sure
Arthurian
legends
may
be
popular
but
at
the
possible
expense
of
angering
Arthurian
scholars
and
fans
are
the
legends
actually
important
The
answer
to
this
is
subjective
and
depends
on
the
audience
s
opinions

Still
it
cannot
be
denied
that
the
legends
are
classics
that
illustrate
an
important
piece
of
history
no
matter
Arthur
s
status
as
real
or
fiction

Like
fairytales
they
are
a
snapshot
of
how
and
what
people
s
beliefs
were
like
at
the
time

Arthurian
legends
have
also
been
proved
to
withstand
the
test
of
time
from
mediaeval
to
the
modern
era

As
mentioned
they
have
been
revamped
a
great
number
of
times
in
the
form
of
official
published
works
to
writings
across
fanfiction
sites
although
essentially
all
Arthur
retellings
are
fanfiction
of
sorts

It
has
become
a
cultural
work
of
considerable
significance
and
its
enduring
popularity
demonstrates
that
the
legends
are
still
fully
capable
of
attracting
a
sizable
audience
old
young
and
anywhere
in
between

The
many
adaptations
of
Arthurian
legends
in
the
fantasy
genre
like
C
S

Lewis
The
Chronicles
of
Narnia
and
even
George
Lucas
Star
Wars
undoubtedly
attest
to
the
legends
influence

Not
only
have
they
been
featured
heavily
in
fiction
and
academia
aspects
of
it
namely
Excalibur
and
mediaeval
armour
have
also
made
circles
in
the
fashion
world
as
seen
in
the
form
of
Italian
designer
Alberta
Ferretti
s
limited
edition
collection
inspired
by
King
Arthur

There
are
also
those
who
have
dedicated
their
time
and
effort
to
uncovering
the
real
life
counterparts
of
the
settings
in
which
Arthurian
legends
take
place

In
particular
it
has
been
widely
hypothesised
that
Avalon
could
in
actuality
be
Glastonbury
or
Isle
of
Man
though
the
lack
of
substantial
evidence
points
Avalon
to
be
a
myth
derived
from
early
Celtic
tales

The
story
of
King
Arthur
dives
into
romance
and
chivalry

Historian
Michael
Woods
suggests
that
King
Arthur
s
times
was
a
golden
age
of
lost
innocence
hence
forging
a
strong
connection
with
people
who
long
for
a
sense
of
dignity
and
justice
that
seem
to
only
exist
in
myth

The
diverse
interpretations
of
Arthurian
legends
also
bring
to
light
different
aspects
of
the
tale
such
as
the
contrasting
portrayals
of
Morgan
le
Fay
and
how
it
possesses
links
to
misogyny
and
the
storyteller
s
perspectives

What
do
you
think
of
when
it
comes
to
Arthurian
legends
Is
it
the
memorable
characters
the
beautiful
settings
or
the
weighty
symbolism
Do
you
have
any
theories
of
when
King
Arthur
will
rise
again
Arthurian
legends
can
mean
many
things
to
many
different
people

They
evolve
according
to
its
audience
and
their
expectations
as
well
as
understanding
of
the
stories

Even
so
it
is
evident
that
Arthurian
legends
remain
compelling
in
the
minds
of
the
people

As
the
BBC
reports
Romantics
may
hope
that
one
day
Arthur
will
return
to
rescue
his
people

But
if
he
lives
on
through
his
legend
the
ancient
monarch
it
would
appear
has
never
really
gone
away
