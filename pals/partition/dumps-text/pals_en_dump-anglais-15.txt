The
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollow
Washington

Historic
Hudson
Valley
Presents
Beloved
by
generations
of
readers
Washington
Irving
s
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollow
ranks
among
the
classics
of
American
literature

Although
it
is
one
of
Irving
s
shortest
works
it
has
had
a
long
life
since
it
first
was
published
in


For
nearly
years
the
story
has
captured
the
imagination
of
both
children
and
adults

The
characters
setting
and
events
come
alive
through
Irving
s
descriptions
and
artists
of
all
types
have
used
the
story
for
source
material

From
shortly
after
the
story
s
first
publication
until
today
the
story
has
inspired
creative
works
illustrations
paintings
sculpture
music
films
television
shows
even
advertising

The
Story
Legend
possesses
elements
of
a
thriller
but
at
the
heart
of
the
tale
is
a
love
triangle
set
in
Sleepy
Hollow
on
the
shore
of
the
Hudson
River
at
the
turn
of
the
th
century

Ichabod
Crane
an
itinerant
schoolteacher
falls
for
Katrina
Van
Tassel
the
pretty
daughter
of
a
prosperous
local
family

Ichabod
s
gangling
appearance
and
odd
habits
as
well
as
his
obvious
attraction
to
Katrina
make
him
an
easy
target
for
Katrina
s
other
suitor
Brom
Bones
the
swaggering
village
blade
in
Irving
s
description

Tension
builds
between
Brom
and
Ichabod
until
one
dark
autumn
night
when
Ichabod
riding
along
a
lonely
wooded
road
finds
himself
with
a
ghostly
headless
companion

Overwhelmed
by
fear
and
all
the
spooky
tales
he
has
heard
Ichabod
flees
hoping
to
reach
the
security
of
the
nearby
bridge
and
churchyard

The
horseman
gives
chase
and
just
as
Ichabod
reaches
safety
the
horseman
throws
what
appears
to
be
his
head
at
the
schoolteacher

The
next
day
Ichabod
cannot
be
found
but
the
villagers
discover
his
horse
and
the
remains
of
a
pumpkin
leaving
the
reader
to
speculate
as
to
what
happened

Was
Ichabod
s
encounter
with
a
true
ghost
Or
was
he
the
victim
of
a
cruel
prank
Irving
s
inspirations
Irving
wrote
Legend
while
living
in
England

Some
scholars
suggest
Irving
s
tale
may
have
been
inspired
by
folk
stories
he
heard
during
his
time
abroad

German
English
and
Scandinavian
folktales
involving
a
headless
rider
chasing
hapless
travelers
have
been
told
for
many
generations

Irving
may
have
heard
or
read
versions
of
these
tales
and
reimagined
his
own
iteration
in
the
Hudson
River
Valley
setting
he
knew
so
well

The
author
incorporated
many
local
names
and
details
adding
an
air
of
authenticity
to
his
telling

He
also
claimed
that
the
original
text
was
found
among
the
papers
of
the
late
Diedrich
Knickerbocker
who
in
turn
heard
the
tale
recounted
by
a
pleasant
shabby
gentlemanly
old
fellow
some
years
earlier

These
layers
of
authorship
remind
readers
of
the
essential
nature
of
a
legend
a
story
told
and
retold
by
tradition
and
no
longer
verifiable

Critical
Success
Legend
formed
part
of
The
Sketch
Book
of
Geoffrey
Crayon
a
set
of
stories
written
by
Irving
and
published
in
installments
in
and


Very
quickly
readers
latched
on
to
Irving
s
work

Good
reviews
from
Irving
s
influential
literary
friends
helped
but
critics
outside
his
circle
raved
too

English
critics
were
favorably
impressed
that
an
American
author
could
write
so
well
and
Irving
delighted
in
having
upended
English
literary
prejudices

Multiple
reprints
and
editions
followed
in
England
and
in
the
United
States
as
well
as
foreign
language
translations

The
early
literary
success
of
The
Sketch
Book
helped
Irving
to
build
his
career
as
a
writer
and
eventually
enabled
him
to
purchase
Sunnyside
make
improvements
to
the
property
and
help
his
family
members
financially

Legend
has
never
been
out
of
print
since
it
first
was
published

Irving
wrote
many
other
works
but
arguably
Legend
remains
the
most
popular
perhaps
because
fans
of
the
story
love
to
be
a
bit
frightened
imagining
themselves
in
Ichabod
s
saddle
fleeing
for
their
lives
from
a
headless
phantom

A
Part
of
Popular
Culture
Irving
makes
no
mention
of
Halloween
in
his
tale
rather
he
set
the
climax
in
the
evening
of
a
fine
autumnal
day

The
ghostly
and
frightening
elements
of
the
tale
however
mean
it
is
now
closely
associated
with
the
holiday

The
link
is
strengthened
by
artists
who
have
shown
the
horseman
carrying
a
scary
jack
o
lantern
as
a
head
embellishing
what
Irving
only
suggests
that
the
horseman
s
head
was
actually
a
pumpkin

Thanks
to
the
wide
readership
of
Irving
s
story
now
combined
with
the
number
of
people
who
know
one
of
the
many
children
s
editions
comic
books
animated
cartoons
films
or
television
shows
inspired
by
the
tale
the
characters
are
well
known
and
easily
identified

They
have
been
appropriated
and
reimagined
and
as
a
result
have
become
even
further
embedded
in
American
popular
culture

Through
new
vehicles
and
representations
Irving
s
tale
keeps
audiences
amused
captivated
and
terrified
after
nearly
two
centuries
