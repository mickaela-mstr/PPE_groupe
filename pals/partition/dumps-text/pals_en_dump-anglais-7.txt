nature
of

not

About
HuntingMarch
We
decided
to
write
this
page
because
of
continual
confusion
about
this
forum
s
stand
on
hunting

This
is
not
a
pro
hunting
blog
nor
an
anti
hunting
blog

There
is
a
good
reason

Bad
feeling
between
hunters
and
those
don
t
like
hunting
is
probably
the
single
biggest
reason
why
there
is
not
a
widespread
political
movement
to
protect
and
enhance
wildlife
and
wildlife
habitat
in
the
United
States

Part
of
this
split
is
philosophical
but
part
is
deliberately
stirred
up
by
those
who
have
other
political
and
economic
agendas

We
would
rather
not
have
discussions
about
the
wrongness
or
rightfulness
of
hunting
but
they
seem
unavoidable

However
we
will
step
in
when
they
get
personal
or
otherwise
out
of
hand

Rural
legends

Ralph
Maughan

It
was
suggested
in
another
thread
that
it
would
be
interesting
informative
and
useful
to
come
up
with
a
list
and
or
discuss
what
JB
has
called
rural
legends

These
would
be
similar
to
the
well
known
term
urban
legends
but
they
would
be
much
more
common
in
rural
areas
and
deal
with
the
outdoors
wildlife
hunting
and
fishing
farming
grazing
politics
related
to
these
things

So
let
s
see
if
we
can
discover
some

Already
a
number
or
people
have
described
the
belief
that
the
state
wildlife
department
or
the
federal
government
is
dropping
transplanting
turning
loose
various
kinds
of
undesirable
animals
in
rural
areas

I
first
heard
this
rumor
in
Idaho
in
the
early
s
when
there
was
the
persistent
rumor
that
Idaho
Fish
and
Game
was
turning
loose
bad
grizzly
bears
from
Yellowstone
Park
onto
Coolwater
Ridge
which
is
a
tall
and
broad
ridge
between
the
Selway
and
Lochsa
Rivers
in
north
central
Idaho
hundreds
of
miles
from
Yellowstone
Park

more
important
A
rural
legend
would
be
a
sub
class
of
urban
legends
according
the
the
Wikipedia
article
on
urban
legends

Despite
its
name
a
typical
urban
legend
does
not
necessarily
originate
in
an
urban
setting

The
term
is
simply
used
to
differentiate
modern
legend
from
traditional
folklore
in
preindustrial
times

For
this
reason
sociologists
and
folklorists
prefer
the
term
contemporary
legend

Urban
and
rural
legends
are
not
the
same
as
myths
but
they
are
related

Once
again
from
the
Wikipedia
The
earliest
term
by
which
these
narratives
were
known
urban
belief
tales
highlights
what
was
then
thought
to
be
a
key
property
they
were
held
by
their
tellers
to
be
true
accounts
and
the
device
of
the
FOAF
was
a
spurious
but
significant
effort
at
authentication

The
coinage
leads
in
turn
to
the
terms
FOAFlore
and
FOAFtale


While
at
least
one
classic
legend
the
Death
Car
has
been
shown
to
have
some
basis
in
fact
folklorists
as
such
are
interested
in
debunking
these
narratives
only
to
the
degree
that
establishing
non
factuality
warrants
the
assumption
that
there
must
be
some
other
reason
why
the
tales
are
told
and
believed

As
in
the
case
of
myth
these
narratives
are
believed
because
they
construct
and
reinforce
the
of
the
group
within
which
they
are
told
or
because
they
provide
us
with
coherent
and
convincing
explanations
of
complex
events
For
this
reason
it
is
characteristic
of
groups
within
which
a
given
narrative
circulates
to
react
very
negatively
to
claims
or
demonstrations
of
non
factuality
an
example
would
be
the
expressions
of
outrage
by
police
officers
who
are
told
that
adulteration
of
Halloween
treats
by
strangers
is
extremely
rare
if
it
has
occurred
at
all
or
the
vehement
responses

Where
to
begin
Let
s
see
Fish
Wildlife
brought
in
coyotes
to
kill
off
the
deer

Huh
When
coys
started
popping
up
in
KY
there
weren
t
that
many
deer
The
deer
population
has
just
exploded
in
the
last
or
so
years

The
reintroduced
elk
all
have
that
mad
cow
disease

Uh
no
or
at
least
to
the
best
of
the
state
veterinarian
s
knowledge
none
of
them
were
carrying
CWD

There
have
been
a
few
cases
of
some
type
of
a
brain
worm
but
no
CWD
thank
God
They
brought
in
bears
and
mountain
lions
to
kill
off
the
diseased
elk

See
previous
statement
hate
to
tell
em
but
there
were
lions
bears
in
the
mountains
of
Eastern
KY
loooong
before
the
elk
introduction
took
place
no
matter
what
the
powers
that
be
might
think
And
my
favorite
Fish
Wildlife
released
rattlesnakes
in
the
mountains
to
try
to
keep
out
hunters

Nope
they
ve
been
there
forever
too

But
I
ve
heard
that
a
lot
of
the
good
ol
boys
used
to
release
rattlesnakes
around
their
pot
fields
to
keep
people
from
looking
too
closely

That
one
s
most
likely
true

Oh
and
I
forgot
this
one
When
the
state
deer
population
was
hit
by
a
gnat
borne
hemorrhagic
syndrome
last
year
similar
to
blue
tongue
but
different
I
can
t
tell
you
how
many
people
I
tried
mostly
unsuccessfully
to
explain
to
that
it
wasn
t
mad
cow
disease
that
it
was
something
totally
different
The
usual
response
was
Well
that
s
what
they
want
you
to
think
Ahhh
conspiracy
theorizing

Ralph
that
is
a
good
one



I
hope
it
was
true
The
legends
I
have
heard
from
around
here
are
the
same
ones
you
always
hear
everywhere
I
guess

Last
week
I
went
out
to
one
of
my
favorite
spots
in
Washington
and
ran
into
a
road
crew
that
was
fixing
the
road
I
wanted
to
go
down

It
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
the
work
had
stopped
but
the
security
guard
and
his
family
were
staying
the
night
there
to
watch
the
equipment

I
talked
with
him
about
a
slide
area
you
couldn
t
drive
around
which
they
had
fixed





and
then
he
mentioned
that
he
and
his
family
had
seen
a
huge
black
bear
about
lbs
and
that
there
were
a
couple
of
rigs
of
bear
hunters
chasing
him
right
then
and
that
the
big
bear
was
running
around
right
where
I
wanted
to
ride
my
bike

So
we
launched
into
a
talk
about
bears
and
he
told
me
after
he
realized
I
wasn
t
ascared
of
black
bears
that
now
grizzlies






that
s
another
thing
we
might
have
some
of
those
around
and
they
are
monsters




they
will
come
right
in
on
ya

I
wanted
to
get
on
to
what
I
came
to
do
so
I
cut
him
short
on
that
with
the
fact
that
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
them
in
Alaska
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
written
a
book
on
them

I
suspect
that
had
I
been
a
little
less
knowledgeable
about
bears
I
would
have
turned
around
and
gone
home



which
actually
I
did
after
I
tracked
the
bear
hunters
for
a
while
and
realized
that


the
bear
got
away
and


that
they
were
frustrated
and
on
the
ridge
above
me

I
am
way
more
ascared
of
a
rifle
than
a
bear

Wolf
which
is

consumes
everything
in

A
couple
of

myths
wolves
have
never

attacked

in

In

are
decimating

populations
across

one
has

The
reintroduction
of
wolves
was
designed
to
drive
the
Western
livestock
industry
out
of
business



Salle
Avatar
Salle

And
The
wolves
were
also
reintroduced
to
kill
all
the
elk
so
that
they
could
close
down
hunting
and
ATVing
in
the
woods
in
order
to
drive
EVERYBODY
OUT
OF
THE
WOODS

And
then
you
know
the
moose
around
Yellowstone
are
decimated
by
the
wolves
AND
that
they
get
this
in
fifteen
years
time
have
evolved

Now
this
gets
interesting
because
there
are
TWO
evolution
stories
here
depending
on
which
they
you
re
going
for
here
a
the
moose
have
evolved
in
such
a
way
as
to
have
different
antlers
that
are
now
capable
of
scewering
two
wolves
in
one
swing
of
their
head
b
the
wolves
that
were
reintroduced
to
Yellowstone
in
were
NOT
the
first
reintroduction
attempt
this
last
century

They
were
actually
reintroduced
in
the
late
s
from
someplace
in
northern
Minnesota
and
let
out
somewhere
near
Gardiner
and
that
they
were
some
vicious
strain
of
powerwolf
but
the
ones
from
the
reintroduction
were
smaller
and
tamer
and
they
have
now
interbred
and
evolved
into
a
more
tolerable
strain
of
wolf

Though
they
have
still
over
populated
and
have
eaten
all
the
available
elk
to
date

Then
did
you
know
that
wolves
have
several
litters
of
pups
a
year
as
in
several
times
a
year
like
cats
can

They
never
told
me
about
these
things
in
genetics
class
And
I
didn
t
miss
a
lecture

s

I
heard
at
the
gas
station
a
few
weeks
ago
The
government
wants
to
list
Polar
Bears
in
order
to
end
hunting

There
are
actually
lots
of
polar
bears
in
the
Arctic
but
the
government
changes
the
numbers
to
say
they
are
endangered
just
to
stop
all
bear
hunting
and
promote
the
environmentalist
global

Hal
and
JB
nailed
it

The
legend
of
the
introduced
insatiable
omnipotent
Canadian
Wolf
has
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
tales
ever
told

The
gist
being
that
somehow
the
feds
introduced
a
version
of
wolf
that
was
never
here
to
begin
with
and
outcompeted
the
version
of
the
wolf
that
was
already
here
in


This
alternate
strain
of
wolf
kills
everything
is
huge
and
wholly
fearless
of
humans

Oh
and
it
has
no
morals
unlke
its
smaller
kind
hearted
and
apparently
herbivorian
brother
that
was
here
originally

I
guess
my
question
is
this
do
people
really
think
wolves
recognize
or
have
ever
recognized
international
borders
If
you
believe
this
legend
then
you
believe
that
wolves
in
Idaho
did
not
historically
intermingle
with
wolves
in
Canada

Ever

But
alas
logic
does
not
rule
the
day
and
I
am
merely
laughed
at
by
the
fiends
in
their
Spire
of

And
I

I

to

that

Yes
that
would
be
a
myth

to

that

primarily
kill
the

the

and
the

would
be
accurate

I
think
that
is
what

correct
anyone

I

is
no

the

the
detriment

everything

Based
on
the
earful
I
get
on
occasion
from
some
of
my
favorite
storytellers
The
one
about
wolves
being
overpopulated
now
is
widespread
I
hear
it
from
tourists
from
other
areas
of
the
country

They
know
next
to
nothing
a
great
number
of
the
folks
I
encounter
at

the

doesn

it
much

wait
we
forgot
the
one
where
wolves
were
reintroduced
by
vegatarians
so
thatthey
could
kill
the
cows
off
and
woves
were
an
environmentalist
scheme
to
kill
all
the
cattle
on
public
lands


the
pine
beetle
problem
is
a
result
of
the
government
trying
to
use
them
to
control
weeds
wolves
would
have
died
out
in
the
Rockies
even
if
they
hadn
t
been
hunted
to
extinction
there


wolves
kill
every
animal
they
come
across
and
leave
them
there
to
rot


all
hunters
want
to
keep
elk
feeding
grounds
so
they
can
shoot
bigger
bulls
and
get
more
cow
tags
every
rancher
is
a
wolf
hater


women
who
are

attract
wolves
coyotes
and

mate

I
really
don
t
know
why
you
think
that
the
only
useful
animal
to
a
hunter
is
one
that
he
can
kill

Most
true
sportsmen
enjoy
all
the
critters
and
yes
even
the
wolves
at
times

As
far
as
bigfoot
tags
go
I
really
don
t
feel
there
numbers
are
great
enough
yet
for
a
season
and
personally
I
hope
no
matter
how
many
there
are
they
won
t
open
a
season

I
would
however
like
to
train
one
to
pack
out
my
elk

I
actually
own
an
atv
but
I
don
t
hunt
from
it
and
with
me
getting
older
I
can
t
pack
as
well
as
I
used
to

I
ve
been
told
though
that
the
bigfoot
is
really
fond
of
jerky
and
with
the
right
jerky
you
can
get
them
to
do
almost
anything

I
ve
never
tried
b
bq
rats
or
bigfoot
but
with
enough
catsup
you
can
make
anything
taste
better
probably
even
a
wolf

Little
bit
out
of
this
topic
here
nevertheless
I
have
no
problem
at
all
with
hunting
in
general
hunting
for
food
delicious
to
be
precise

This
however
does
not
include
what
in
Africa
is
called
hunting
bushmeat
animals
that
are
not
really
edible


I
have
however
a
problem
with
huting
in
so
far
as
over
the
centuries
countless
species
have
been
driven
into
extinction
or
to
near
extinction
by
over
hunting

I
have
a
severe
problem
with
ego
hunting

With
the
sportsmen
a
term
left
over
from
the
glory
days
of
hunting
in
the
commonwealth
I
think
putting
the
lights
out
of
a
bear
a
tiger
a
lion
a
buffalo
a
coyote
an
elk
a
wolf
or
whatever
it
is
just
for
the
fun
of
it
just
because
one
is
able
to
do
so
Just
to
show
with
a
pelt
hanging
near
the
fireplace
what
a
tough
guy
one
is

Just
to
prove
with
a
picture
where
one
is
posing
with
a
sheepish
grin
behind
a
bear
carcass
or
even
worse
with
one
foot
on
this
carcass

I
honestly
dislike
the
hypocritical
is
this
the
appropriate
word
attitude
of
our
german
hunting
organisations
We
accept
the
presence
of
those
wolves
only
if
we
are
allowed
to
manage
them

Pennsylvania

around
at

in

but
that
doesn
t
stop
some
folks
from
reporting
having
seen
a
wolf
or
wolves
in
the
state
or
Northeast

Here
s
a
comment
one
of
my
blog
s
recent
postings
elicited
from
a
reader

Cougars

mill
participants
wouldn
t
one
have
been
road
killed
by
now
given
the
presence
of
so
many
roads
on
the
landscape


I
saw
a
black
wolf
in
SW
Pennsylvania
years
ago

At
first
it
looked
like
a
small
medium
bear
due
to
distance


I
ran
to
my
truck
to
grab
my
spotting
scope
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
is
was
a
wolf

I
am
a
Biologist
and
so
is
one
other
person
that
was
in
our
group

There
is
no
chance
that
this
animal
was
a
coyote

I
have
lived
in
close
proximity
to
several
packs
over
the
years
and
I
know
this
animal
was
no
coyote

I
m
also
willing
to
wager
that
it
was
no
wild
dog

Unfortunately
it
was
too
far
away
to
get
decent
photos
but
with
the
spotting
scope
we
got
very
good
looks

my

comments
I
remember
hearing
a
story
from
an

about
how
he
was
confronted
by
someone
in
Riggins
Idaho
about
how
the
IDFG
was
stocking
grizzly
bears
wolves
and
rattlesnakes
in
the
area

I
ve
also
heard
the
stories
about
Yellowstone
rangers
being
asked
questions
like
Why
do
they
put
the
blue
stuff
in
the
lake
Why
are
the
those
little
red
dogs
hanging
out
with
the
buffalo
When
do
the
deer
turn
into
elk
moose
As
a
fisheries
person
I
overheard
someone
explaining
that
the
trout
hanging
out
with
the
salmon
were
bull
trout
that
were
going
to
dig
up
the
eggs
so
they
could
eat
them

They
were
actually
jack
Chinook
salmon
or
males
that
only
spend
one
year
in
the
ocean
as
compared
to
or
three

FYI
they
die
just

of

I

The
first
outlined
stage
is
a
scarcity
of
wild
game
be
it
due
to
habitat
loss
seasonal
migration
or
often
times
over
predation

Wolves
begin
approaching
human
habitations
though
limiting
their
visits
to
nocturnal
hours

Their
presence
is
usually
established
by
barking
matches
with
local
dogs

After
a
certain
amount
of
time
wolves
begin
to
frequent
human
habitations
in
daylight
hours
and
observe
people
and
livestock
at
a
distance

The
wolves
begin
acting
bolder
by
attacking
small
stock
and
pets
at
daylight
sometimes
pursuing
their
prey
up
to
verandas

The
wolves
at
this
point
do
not
focus
on
humans
but
will
growl
and
act
threateningly
toward
them

The
wolves
begin
attacking
large
bodied
livestock
and
may
follow
riders

People
begin
to
be
harassed
usually
in
a
playful
manner

The
wolves
will
chase
people
over
short
distances
and
nip
at
them
though
will
retreat
if
confronted

Wolves
begin
to
attack
people
in
predatory
fashions

on

I

the

polars
will
attack
people
for
food
as
well
as
self
defense
but
that
other

bears
only
attack
people
in

Then
I

that

will
attack
people
for

Let
s
not

the
wily
critter
of
the
plains
and
sagebrush

The
trophy
Jack
a
lope

A
friend
of
mine
had
a
sporting
goods
store
in
western
colorado
when
I
lived
there

I
would
help
him
out
at
times
with
bore
sighting
rifles
for
the
out
of
state
hunters
that
would
come
into
the
store
to
buy
their
elk
and
deer
tags

He
had
a
Jack
a
lope
mount
on
the
wall
and
you
wouldn
t
believe
how
many
people
would
belive
that
he
had
actually
taken
it
not
miles
from
the
store
some
even
asked
if
they
had
tags
available

Those
are
the
years
I
wore
extra
orange
during
the
season
and
probably
a
big
reason
I
started
archery
hunting
more
than

Actually
black
bears
have
attacked
more
people
than
any
of
the
others
but
there
are
more
black
bears
living
where
there
are
more
people
so
there
are
more
encounters

Personally
I
don
t
trust
any
of
them
and
respect
all
the
predators
actually
all
wild
animals

The
only
bear
I
ve
ever
had
to
dispose
of
had
been
wounded
a
week
prior
to
our
meeting
by
some
other
hunters
that
made
a
bad
shot
he
fell
seven
feet
from
my
rifle
barrel
and
scared
the
hell
out
of
me
at
full
charge
this
however
is
not
normal
and
he
was
a
black

I
ve
had
black
bears
close
several
times
and
they
will
dance
on
there
forepaws
back
and
forth
woofing
and
huffing
sometimes
popping
their
teeth
so
loud
you
would
think
they
would
break
but
every
time
I
ve
seen
this
I
back
out
slowly
and
other
than
maybe
having
to
clean
out
my
drawers
haven
t
had
problem

I
ve
read
many
books
on
documented
bear
attacks
and
all
species
will
attack
under
the
right
circumstances

The
main
thing
to
do
when
in
the
woods
I
think
is
mainly
be
aware
of
your
surroundings
pay
attention
to
the
tracks
and
scat
certain
areas
during
certain
times
of
the
year
are
used
more
often
than
others
by
bears

Personally
in
North
Idaho
we
have
more
encounters
with
moose
than
bears

Their
big
and
can
get
kind
of
crazy
during
the
rut
and
calving
season

a

forwarded
those

vicki
I
was
just
wondering
where
they
were
taken
but
there
was
nothing
there
except
rocky
mountains


So
do
black
bears
attack
people
and
deer
etc

for
food
regularly
I
was
under
the
impression
that
like
wolves
they
normally
kept
to
smaller
stuff
and
fish
and
being
omnivorous
also
relied
on
vegetation
so
that
they
normally
left
people
alone

I
know
about
the
tying
up
your
grub
when
you
re
out
there
so
the
bears
won
t
get
it
but
there
s
never
really
any
warning
about
the
bears
getting
You
unless
you
come
between
them
and
their
food
or
their

liked
this
on
Ranger
tells
everyone
to
wear
bells
around
their
neck
and
carry
pepper
spray
to
ward
off
bear
attack

The
bells
alert
the
bears
to
your
presence
and
the
spray
is
a
last
ditch
ten
feet
hail
Mary
when
all
else
fails

He
tells
the
hikers
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
bears
in
the
area
Grizzlies
and
Black
bears

He
then
tells
them
that
they
need
to
recognize
the
bear
s
scat
so
they
can
tell
the
two
species
apart

He
sez
that
black
bears
are
much
less
likely
to
attack
so
when
they
see
black
bear
scat
they
may
continue

But
if
they
encounter
grizzly
scat
they
should
give
the
area
a
wide
berth

A
tourist
asks
how
to
tell
the
difference

The
ranger
replies
Easy
black
bears
are
grazers
more
than
fish
eaters

The
black
bear
scat
is
usually
full
of
blackberry
seeds
hackberrys
and
acorns
and
other
plant
life
and
it
smells
like
almonds

Grizzly
scat
is
larger
and
it
is
full
of
bells
and
smells
like
pepper
spray
