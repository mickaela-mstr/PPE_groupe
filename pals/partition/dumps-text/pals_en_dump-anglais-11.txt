We
all
know
that
the
Slender
Man
is
nothing
more
than
a
pure
urban
legend
created
online
in
on
an
Internet
forum

However
since
then
it
has
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own
even
being
connected
with
several
attempted
murders
as
well
as
a
spate
of
suicides
and
a
possible
mass
suicide
attempt

While
nobody
is
arguing
that
the
Slender
Man
is
real
at
least
in
the
physical
sense
the
belief
in
him
by
some
has
made
the
consequences
of
the
legend
very
real
for
some

Here
are
ten
very
unsettling
points
about
the
legend
and
reality
of
the
Slender

Unlike
many
other
legends
and
myths
the
origins
of
the
Slender
Man
can
be
traced
to
the
exact
date
of
its
creation

At
some
point
on
June
the
Internet
forum
Something
Awful
unleashed
two
photographs

They
were
created
by
user
Victor
Surge
whose
real
name
was
eventually
revealed
to
be
Eric
Knudsen


He
had
created
them
in
response
to
a
challenge
by
the
forum
s
admin
to
create
paranormal
images
that
might
make
people
believe
they
were
genuine

The
first
picture
dating
from
showed
a
group
of
children
looking
upset
and
frightened

In
the
background
is
a
discreet
extraordinarily
tall
faceless
man

The
caption
read
We
didn
t
want
to
go
we
didn
t
want
to
kill
them
but
its
persistent
silence
and
outstretched
arms
horrified
us
and
comforted
us
at
the
same
time
That
quote
was
attributed
to
the
unknown
photographer
who
was
presumed
dead

The
second
picture
was
dated
three
years
later
in


It
showed
children
looking
altogether
happier
while
playing
in
a
park

Discreetly
though
the
same
tall
figure
can
be
seen
lurking
in
the
background

The
caption
informed
those
who
viewed
the
picture
that
it
was
one
of
two
recovered
photographs
from
the
Stirling
City
Library
blaze

It
also
stated
that
the
photo
was
taken
the
day
which
fourteen
children
vanished
and
even
referenced
Slender
Man

This
time
the
photographer
was
named
as
Mary
Thomas
who
had
been
missing
since
June


These
two
pictures
not
only
gave
birth
to
the
Slender
Man
legends
but
they
also
captivated
thousands
upon
thousands
of
people
almost
immediately

Although
Knudsen
was
responsible
for
the
Slender
Man
s
creation
it
would
be
the
many
followers
of
Creepypasta
who
would
truly
bring
him
to
life

As
more
and
more
people
became
aware
of
Slender
Man
and
added
their
own
details
and
little
pieces
of
the
backstory
the
legend
grew

He
was
often
depicted
with
a
white
featureless
face
and
was
slim
abnormally
tall
and
often
with
tentacles
coming
from
his
back

He
also
became
associated
with
abandoned
buildings
often
in
the
wilderness
or
the
woods

Some
details
added
later
even
claimed
that
the
Slender
Man
could
teleport
from
one
place
to
another

Those
who
were
interested
in
the
Slender
Man
even
agreed
signs
that
he
was
near
and
watching
you

Such
signs
as
sudden
paranoia
nosebleeds
and
intense
nightmares

In
fact
this
creation
of
a
legend
by
the
audience
themselves
is
the
subject
of
our
next
point

How
this
growth
can
be
monitored
and
studied
by
those
who
study
myths
and
folklore
of
the
past

Many
who
study
legends
folklore
and
mythology
have
looked
at
the
Slender
Man
legends
as
a
way
of
being
able
to
document
its
growth
and
reach

And
in
doing
so
they
look
to
understand
how
legends
of
the
past
might
have
developed
and
grown
in
a
similar
way

For
example
there
is
a
collective
element
to
the
growth
of
the
Slender
Man
legend
as
we
examined
above

What
s
more
slight
details
change
depending
on
who
is
telling
the
tale
or
who
the
audience
might
be

Indeed
the
more
accounts
that
were
retold
of
the
Slender
Man
online
as
opposed
to
orally
in
this
case
the
more
the
legend
and
the
backstory
grew

The
Slender
Man
legend
had
very
quickly
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own
much
like
myths
and
folklore
of
the
past

However
several
years
after
his
creation
the
Slender
Man
became
real
in
a
much
grittier
way

On
May
the
Slender
Man
or
at
least
the
consequences
of
the
legend
spilled
over
into
the
real
world
in
a
very
dramatic
way

On
the
morning
in
question
two
year
old
girls
Anissa
Weier
and
Morgan
Geyser
attempted
to
murder
their
friend
Payton
Leutner
by
stabbing
her
multiple
times
in
the
woods

After
being
left
for
dead
she
eventually
stumbled
out
and
was
discovered
by
a
passing
cyclist

The
girls
were
arrested
a
short
time
later

When
questioned
Weier
claimed
they
had
launched
the
attack
in
order
to
please
the
Slender
Man

What
s
more
they
also
believed
they
knew
where
the
Slender
Man
lived
an
old
house
in
the
Nicolet
National
Forest
a
location
they
were
on
their
way
to
when
they
were
arrested

For
all
intents
and
purposes
it
could
be
argued
that
for
the
attackers
and
their
victim
alike
the
Slender
Man
or
the
consequences
of
him
were
very
real

Incidentally
Weier
was
released
from
a
mental
health
facility
in
the
summer
of


Geyser
on
the
other

incarcerated

Payton
Leutner

Following
the
attempted
murder
of
Payton
Leutner
several
copycat
cases
occurred
all
with
various
connections
to
the
Slender
Man
legends

For
example
only
weeks
later
in
June
in
Hamilton
County
Ohio
a
year
old
girl
attacked
her
mother
with
a
knife

In
the
investigation
that
followed
it
was
discovered
that
she
had
an
obsession
with
the
Slender
Man

Several
months
after
that
in
September
in
Port
Richey
Florida
a
year
old
girl
set
fire
to
her
family
home

According
to
reports
she
was
inspired
by
the
Slender
Man
to
do
so

Incidentally
all
of
those
inside
escaped
the
burning
building
and
the
young
girl
was
arrested
the
following
morning

Even
the
murders
of
two
police
officers
and
a
member
of
the
public
in
Las
Vegas
in
the
summer
of
followed
by
the
suicide
of
the
alleged
killer
and
his
wife
was
connected
to
the
Slender
Man
after
neighbors
told
the
media
that
he
would
often
dress
up
as
the
Internet
legend
and
parade
around
his
house
and
yard

In
the
summer
of
The
New
York
Times
published
an
article
detailing
the
suicides
of
multiple
young
people
between
the
ages
of
and
who
had
committed
suicide
on
the
Pine
Ridge
Reservation
in
South
Dakota
in
the
previous
six
months
alone

What
is
particularly
interesting
about
this
wave
of
suicides
is
that
the
article
also
claimed
that
several
officials
with
knowledge
of
the
cases
said
that
at
least
one
of
the
youths
who
committed
suicide
was
influenced
by
Slender
Man

What
is
further
interesting
about
the
alleged
connections
to
the
Slender
Man
legends
and
these
tragic
deaths
are
legends
of
the
reservation
itself

They
speak
of
a
spirit
named
the
Tall
Man
or
Walking
Sam

What
this
spirit
did
was
to
encourage
those
he
chose
to
visit
to
take
their
own
lives

It
is
perhaps
a
coincidence
that
there
are
similarities
between
the
legends
of
the
Slender
Man
and
these
Native
American
legends

However
the
coming
together
of
them
within
this
reservation
s
community
very
well
might
have
resulted
in
tragic
consequences

A
particularly
grim
account
tells
of
a
narrowly
aborted
mass
suicide
at
the
same
reservation
mentioned
above

According
to
the
story
multiple
teenagers
suddenly
set
out
to
a
specific
spot
in
the
woods
and
started
preparing
ropes
by
tying
them
to
the
branches
of
the
trees

They
were
clearly
planning
on
committing
suicide
hanging
themselves
together
as
a
group

The
local
pastor
on
the
reservation
John
Two
Bulls
heard
of
the
morose
plans
and
immediately
set
out
to
the
location

He
fortunately
managed
to
halt
the
proceedings
and
seemingly
bring
the
group
out
of
whatever
mass
trance
they
appeared
to
have
been
in

Rumblings
from
the
reservation
claimed
that
the
cause
of
the
attempted
mass
suicide
was
a
result
of
the
visitation
of
Walking
Sam

Given
the
publicity
that
the
Slender
Man
was
receiving
at
this
stage
it
is
perhaps
easy
to
understand
how
some
in
the
media
connected
the
legend
of
the
suicide
spirit
and
this
new
urban
legend

A

Account
Nick

Mysteries
Nick

Watch
this
video

Paranormal
author
and
researcher
Nick
Redfern
relayed
a
particularly
intriguing
account
that
was
told
to
him

The
witness
who
he
gave
the
name
Lacy
would
claim
to
have
had
several
real
life
encounters
with
the
Slender
Man
although
not
physical
encounters

She
would
claim
that
she
had
been
researching
the
Slender
Man
for
several
months

Then
one
evening
her
laptop
which
was
on
sleep
mode
suddenly
switched
on
of
its
own
accord

To
her
shock
an
image
of
a
faceless
creature
was
on
the
screen

Within
a
few
seconds
it
was
gone

She
told
herself
she
must
have
imagined
it

However
two
nights
later
the
laptop
once
more
switched
on
of
its
own
accord

When
it
did
the
face
appeared
again
only
this
time
it
was
much
clearer

Things
went
quiet
for
several
weeks
and
Lacy
had
almost
forgotten
the
incidents

That
was
until
her
laptop
came
on
again

This
time
a
strange
voice
came
from
the
device
stating
we
are
friends

It
was
at
this
point
that
Lacy
shut
the
laptop
down
and
ceased
her
research
into
the
Slender
Man
legends

It
is
easy
and
perhaps
right
to
suggest
that
what
Lacy
experienced
at
best
were
hallucinations
brought
on
by
her
intense
interest
in
and
subconscious
fear
of
the
Slender
Man
legends

It
is
interesting
to
note
once
more
though
that
the
fine
line
in
a
person
believing
in
a
legend
suddenly
making
it
real
is
indeed
delicate
in
the
extreme

Intense
Internet
Debate
What
If

Man
Was

What
If
Slender
Man
Was
Real
Watch
this
video
on

As
we
might
imagine
a
fierce
debate
ensued
following
the
attempting
stabbing
and
the
copycat
cases
that
followed

And
while
it
concentrated
on
the
Slender
Man
at
first
it
soon
moved
on
to
the
Internet
and
the
influence
it
has
on
children
in
general

For
example
in
the
Waukesha
School
District
where
the
attempted
murder
of
Payton
Leutner
took
place
Creepypasta
Wiki
was
blocked

For
their
part
the
administrators
of
the
website
claimed
that
the
stabbing
was
an
isolated
incident

They
also
claimed
their
website
was
a
literary
one
and
not
one
that
condoned
murder

Ultimately
it
was
reasoned
that
all
manner
of
films
TV
programs
and
video
games
that
children
had
access
to
did
not
result
in
such
atrocious
attacks

In
short
the
problem
was
with
the
attackers
themselves
as
opposed
to
the
apparent
catalyst

Although
the
debate
originally
had
momentum
the
more
it
went
on
the
less
sway
it
had

There
is
little
doubt
that
the
Slender
Man
is
the
Boogeyman
of
the
modern
age

If
you
talk
to
anyone
in
the
western
world
under
the
age
of
it
is
almost
certain
they
will
know
who
the
Slender
Man
is

They
might
not
know
the
history
or
even
how
they
heard
of
him
but
the
fact
is
they
know

And
although
they
understand
at
least
for
the
most
part
that
he
is
nothing
more
than
an
urban
legend
he
is
without
a
doubt
in
their
collective
subconscious

There
are
certainly
very
definite
similarities
between
the
Slender
Man
and
the
Boogeyman

Both
are
on
the
prowl
for
children
for
example
and
both
have
grim
abodes
in
out
of
the
way
locations
often
in
the
woods

Of
course
where
the
legend
of
the
Slender
Man
goes
from
here
remains
to
be
seen

Perhaps
he
will
still
be
spoken
in
hundreds
of
years
by
spooked
youngsters
around
the
world
as
much
as
he
is
today
