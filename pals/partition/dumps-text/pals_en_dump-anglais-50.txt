LoL
commonly
referred
to
as
League
is
a
multiplayer
online
battle
arena
video
game
developed
and
published
by
Riot
Games

Inspired
by
Defense
of
the
Ancients
a
custom
map
for
Warcraft
III
Riot
s
founders
sought
to
develop
a
stand
alone
game
in
the
same
genre

Since
its
release
in
October
League
has
been
free
to
play
and
is
monetized
through
purchasable
character
customization

The
game
is
available
for
Microsoft
Windows
and
macOS

In
the
game
two
teams
of
five
players
battle
in
player
versus
player
combat
each
team
occupying
and
defending
their
half
of
the
map

Each
of
the
ten
players
controls
a
character
known
as
a
champion
with
unique
abilities
and
differing
styles
of
play

During
a
match
champions
become
more
powerful
by
collecting
experience
points
earning
gold
and
purchasing
items
to
defeat
the
opposing
team

In
League
s
main
mode
Summoner
s

a
team
wins
by
pushing
through
to
the
enemy
base
and
destroying
their

structure
located
within

League
of
Legends
has
received
generally
positive
reviews
critics
have
highlighted
its
accessibility
character
designs
and
production
value

The
game
s
long
lifespan
has
resulted
in
a
critical
reappraisal
with
reviews
trending
positively
it
is
widely
considered
one
of
the
greatest
video
games
ever
made

However
negative
and
abusive
in
game
player
behavior
criticized
since
the
game
s
early
days
persists
despite
Riot
s
attempts
to
fix
the
problem

In
League
regularly
peaked
at
eight
million
concurrent
players
and
its
popularity
has
led
to
tie
ins
such
as
music
comic
books
short
stories
and
the
animated
series
Arcane

Its
success
has
spawned
several
spin
off
video
games
including
a
mobile
version
a
digital
collectible
card
game
and
a
turn
based
role
playing
game
among
others

A
massively
multiplayer
online

is
the
world
s
largest
esport
with
an
international
competitive
scene
consisting
of
multiple
regional
leagues
that
culminate
in
an
annual

The
event
registered
over
million
unique
viewers
peaking
at
a
concurrent
viewership
of
million
during
the
finals

Domestic

League
of
Legends
is
a
multiplayer
online
battle
arena
MOBA
game
in
which
the
player
controls
a
character
champion
with
a
set
of
unique
abilities
from
an
isometric
perspective

As
of
update
there
are
champions
available
to
play

Over
the
course
of
a
match
champions
gain
levels
by
accruing
experience
points
XP
through
killing
enemies

Items
can
be
acquired
to
increase
champions
strength
and
are
bought
with
gold
which
players
accrue
passively
over
time
and
earn
actively
by
defeating
the
opposing
team
s
minions
champions
or
defensive
structures

In
the
main
game
mode
Summoner
s
Rift
items
are
purchased
through
a
shop
menu
available
to
players
only
when
their
champion
is
in
the
team
s
base

Each
match
is
discrete
levels
and
items
do
not
transfer
from
one
match
to
another

Summoner
s
Rift
The
game
s
main
map

It
is
a
square
with
the
team
bases
on
the
top
right
and
bottom
right
corners

There
are
three
pathways
to
each
base
one
diagonally
across
the
centre
and
the
others
going
up
and
turning
at
the
top
left
and
bottom
right
corners

representation
of
Summoner
s
Rift

The
yellow
paths
are
the
lanes
down
which
minions
march
blue
and
red
dots
represent
turrets

The
fountains
are
the
dark
areas
within
each
base
and

each
Nexus

The

black

indicates
the
river

Summoner
s
Rift
is
the
flagship
game
mode
of
League
of
Legends
and
the
most
prominent
in
professional
level
play

The
mode
has
a
ranked
competitive
ladder
a
matchmaking
system
determines
a
player
s
skill
level
and
generates
a
starting
rank
from
which
they
can
climb

There
are
ten
tiers
the
least
skilled
are
Iron
Bronze
and
Silver
and
the
highest
are
Master
Grandmaster
and
Challenger

a
Two
teams
of
five
players
compete
to
destroy
the
opposing
team
s
Nexus
which
is
guarded
by
the
enemy
champions
and
defensive
structures
known
as
turrets


Each
team
s
Nexus
is
located
in
their
base
where
players
start
the
game
and
reappear
after
death

Non
player
characters
known
as
minions
are
generated
from
each
team
s
Nexus
and
advance
towards
the
enemy
base
along
three
lanes
guarded
by
turrets
top
middle
and
bottom

Each
team
s
base
contains
three
inhibitors
one
behind
the
third
tower
from
the
center
of
each
lane

Destroying
one
of
the
enemy
team
s
inhibitors
causes
stronger
allied
minions
to
spawn
in
that
lane
and
allows
the
attacking
team
to
damage
the
enemy
Nexus
and
the
two
turrets
guarding
it

The
regions
in
between
the
lanes
are
collectively
known
as
the
jungle
which
is
inhabited
by
monsters
that
like
minions
respawn
at
regular
intervals

Like
minions
monsters
provide
gold
and
XP
when
killed

Another
more
powerful
class
of
monster
resides
within
the
river
that
separates
each
team
s
jungle

These
monsters
require
multiple
players
to
defeat
and
grant
special
abilities
to
their
slayers
team

For
example
teams
can
gain
a
powerful
allied
unit
after
killing
the
Rift
Herald
permanent
strength
boosts
by
killing
dragons
and
stronger
more
durable
minions
by
killing
Baron
Nashor

Summoner
s
Rift
matches
can
last
from
as
little
as
minutes
to
over
an
hour

Although
the
game
does
not
enforce
where
players
may
go
conventions
have
arisen
over
the
game
s
lifetime
typically
one
player
goes
in
the
top
lane
one
in
the
middle
lane
one
in
the
jungle
and
two
in
the
bottom
lane

Players
in
a
lane
kill
minions
to
accumulate
gold
and
XP
termed
farming
and
try
to
prevent
their
opponent
from
doing
the
same

A
fifth
champion
known
as
a
jungler
farms
the
jungle
monsters
and
when
powerful
enough
assists
their
teammates
in
a
lane

Other
modes
Besides
Summoner
s
Rift
League
of
Legends
has
two
other
permanent
game
modes

ARAM
All
Random
All
Mid
is
a
five
versus
five
mode
like
Summoner
s
Rift
but
on
a
map
called
Howling
Abyss
with
only
one
long
lane
no
jungle
area
and
with
champions
randomly
chosen
for
players

Given
the
small
size
of
the
map
players
must
be
vigilant
in
avoiding
enemy
abilities

Teamfight
Tactics
is
an
auto
battler
released
in
June
and
made
a
permanent
game
mode
the
following
month

As
with
others
in
its
genre
players
build
a
team
and
battle
to
be
the
last
one
standing

Players
do
not
directly
affect
combat
but
position
their
units
on
a
board
for
them
to
fight
automatically
against
opponents
each
round

Teamfight
Tactics
is
available
for
iOS
and
Android
and
has
cross
platform
play
with
the
Windows
and
macOS
clients

Other
game
modes
have
been
made
available
temporarily
typically
aligning
with
in
game
events

Ultra
Rapid
Fire
URF
mode
was
available
for
two
weeks
as
a
April
Fools
Day
prank

In
the
mode
champion
abilities
have
no
resource
cost
significantly
reduced
cooldown
timers
increased
movement
speed
reduced
healing
and
faster
attacks

A
year
later
in
April
Riot
disclosed
that
they
had
not
brought
the
mode
back
because
its
unbalanced
design
resulted
in
player
burnout


The
developer
also
said
the
costs
associated
with
maintaining
and
balancing
URF
were
too
high

Other
temporary
modes
include
One
for
All
and
Nexus
Blitz

One
for
All
has
players
pick
a
champion
for
all
members
of
their
team
to
play

In
Nexus
Blitz
players
participate
in
a
series
of
mini
games
on
a
compressed
map

West
Los

headquarters
Riot
Games
founders
Brandon
Beck
and
Marc
Merill
had
an
idea
for
a
spiritual
successor
to
Defense
of
the
Ancients
known
as
DotA

A
mod
for
Warcraft
III
Reign
of
Chaos
DotA
required
players
to
buy
Warcraft
III
and
install
custom
software
The
Washington
Post
s
Brian
Crecente
said
the
mod
lacked
a
level
of
polish
and
was
often
hard
to
find
and
set
up


Phillip
Kollar
of
Polygon
noted
that
Blizzard
Entertainment
supported
Warcraft
III
with
an
expansion
pack
then
shifted
their
focus
to
other
projects
while
the
game
still
had
players

Beck
and
Merill
sought
to
create
a
game
that
would
be
supported
over
a
significantly
longer
period

Beck
and
Merill
held
a
DotA
tournament
for
students
at
the
University
of
Southern
California
with
an
ulterior
goal
of
recruitment

There
they
met
Jeff
Jew
later
a
producer
on
League
of
Legends

Jew
was
very
familiar
with
DotA
and
spent
much
of
the
tournament
teaching
others
how
to
play

Beck
and
Merill
invited
him
to
an
interview
and
he
joined
Riot
Games
as
an
intern

Beck
and
Merill
recruited
two
figures
involved
with
DotA
Steve
Feak
one
of
its
designers
and
Steve
Mescon
who
ran
a
support
website
to
assist
players

Feak
said
early
development
was
highly
iterative
comparing
it
to
designing
DotA

A
demonstration
of
League
of
Legends
built
in
the
Warcraft
III
game
engine
was
completed
in
four
months
and
then
shown
at
the
Game
Developers
Conference

There
Beck
and
Merill
had
little
success
with
potential
investors

Publishers
were
confused
by
the
game
s
free
to
play
business
model
and
lack
of
a
single
player
mode

The
free
to
play
model
was
untested
outside
of
Asian
markets
so
publishers
were
primarily
interested
in
a
retail
release
and
the
game
s
capacity
for
a
sequel

In
Riot
reached
an
agreement
with
holding
company
Tencent
to
oversee
the
game
s
launch
in
China

League
of
Legends
was
announced
October
for
Microsoft
Windows

Closed
beta
testing
began
in
April


Upon
the
launch
of
the
beta
seventeen
champions
were
available

Riot
initially
aimed
to
ship
the
game
with
champions
but
doubled
the
number
before
the
game
s
full
release
in
North
America
on
October


The
game
s
full
name
was
announced
as
League
of
Legends
Clash
of
Fates

Riot
planned
to
use
the
subtitle
to
signal
when
future
content
was
available
but
decided
they
were
silly
and
dropped
it
before
launch

Post
release
League
of
Legends
receives
regular
updates
in
the
form
of
patches

Although
previous
games
had
utilized
patches
to
ensure
no
one
strategy
dominated
League
of
Legends
patches
made
keeping
pace
with
the
developer
s
changes
a
core
part
of
the
game

In
Riot
standardized
their
patch
cadence
to
once
approximately
every
two
or
three
weeks

The
development
team
includes
hundreds
of
game
designers
and
artists

In
the
music
team
had
four
full
time
composers
and
a
team
of
producers
creating
audio
for
the
game
and
its
promotional
materials

As
of
update
the
game
has
over
champions
and
Riot
Games
periodically
overhauls
the
visuals
and
gameplay
of
the
oldest
in
the
roster

Although
only
available
for
Microsoft
Windows
at
launch
a
Mac
version
of
the
game
was
made
available
in
March


In
September
Screen
Actors
Guild
for
radio
and
television
placed
League
of
Legends
on
a
list
barring
the
union
s
members
from
working
on
the
game

This
was
to
reprimand
Formosa
Interactive
a
third
party
audio
provider
used
by
Riot
for
using
a
shell
company
to
subvert
the
SAG
AFTRA
video
game
strike
by
employing
non
union
performers
on
a
different
game

Formosa
denied
the
accusations
in
a
statement
emphasising
that
it
was
unrelated
to
Riot

In
a
statement
posted
to
X
Riot
Games
described
League
of
Legends
as
a
union
game
since
and
said
Formosa
Interactive
were
directed
to
work
only
with
union
actors
in
the
US

Riot
described
any
complaints
related
to
other
games
as
unrelated
to
League
of
Legends

Revenue
model
League
of
Legends
uses
a
free
to
play
business
model

Several
forms
of
purely
cosmetic
customization
for
example
skins
that
change
the
appearance
of
champions
can
be
acquired
after
buying
an
in
game
currency
called
Riot
Points
RP


Skins
have
five
main
pricing
tiers
ranging
from
to


An
additional
luxury
tier
was
announced
in
that
cannot
be
purchased
outright
but
must
be
won
using
RP
and
an
in
game
slot
machine
mechanic

As
virtual
goods
they
have
high
profit
margins

A
loot
box
system
has
existed
in
the
game
since
these
are
purchasable
virtual
chests
with
randomized
cosmetic
items

These
chests
can
be
bought
outright
or
acquired
at
a
slower
rate
for
free
by
playing
the
game

The
practice
has
been
criticized
as
a
form
of
gambling

In
Riot
Games
CEO
said
that
he
hoped
loot
boxes
would
become
less
prevalent
in
the
industry

Riot
has
also
experimented
with
other
forms
of
monetization

In
August
they
announced
an
achievement
system
purchasable
with
Riot
Points

The
system
was
widely
criticized
for
its
high
cost
and
low
value

In
Ubisoft
analyst
Teut
Weidemann
said
that
only
around
of
players
paid
for
cosmetics
significantly
lower
than
the
industry
standard
of
to


He
argued
the
game
was
only
profitable
because
of
its
large
player
base

game
s
fictional
setting
removing
summoners
from
the
game
s
lore
to
avoid
creative
stagnation


Luke
Plunkett
wrote
for
Kotaku
that
although
the
change
would
upset
long
term
fans
it
was
necessary
as
the
game
s
player
base
grew
in
size

Shortly
after
the
reboot
Riot
hired
Warhammer
writer
Graham
McNeill

Riot
s
storytellers
and
artists
create
flavor
text
adding
richness
to
the
game
but
very
little
of
this
is
seen
as
a
part
of
normal
gameplay

Instead
that
work
supplies
a
foundation
for
the
franchise
s
expansion
into
other
media
such
as
comic
books
and
spin
off
video
games

The
Fields
of
Justice
were
replaced
by
a
new
fictional
setting
a
planet
called
Runeterra

The
setting
has
elements
from
several
genres
from
Lovecraftian
horror
to
traditional
sword
and
sorcery
fantasy

US
League
of
Legends
received
generally
favorable
reviews
on
its
initial
release
according
to
review
aggregator
website
Metacritic

Many
publications
noted
the
game
s
high
replay
value

Kotaku
reviewer
Brian
Crecente
admired
how
items
altered
champion
play
styles

Quintin
Smith
of
Eurogamer
concurred
praising
the
amount
of
experimentation
offered
by
champions

Comparing
it
to
Defense
of
the
Ancients
Rick
McCormick
of
GamesRadar
said
that
playing
League
of
Legends
was
a
vote
for
choice
over
refinement


Given
the
game
s
origins
other
reviewers
frequently
compared
aspects
of
it
to
DotA

According
to
GamesRadar
and
GameSpot
League
of
Legends
would
feel
familiar
to
those
who
had
already
played
DotA

The
game
s
inventive
character
design
and
lively
colors
distinguished
the
game
from
its
competitors

Smith
concluded
his
review
by
noting
that
although
there
was
not
much
room
for
negativity
Riot
s
goal
of
refining
DotA
had
not
yet
been
realized

Although
Crecente
praised
the
game
s
free
to
play
model
GameSpy
s
Ryan
Scott
was
critical
of
the
grind
required
for
non
paying
players
to
unlock
key
gameplay
elements
calling
it
unacceptable
in
a
competitive
game

b
Many
outlets
said
the
game
was
underdeveloped

A
physical
version
of
the
game
was
available
for
purchase
from
retailers
GameSpot
s
Kevin
VanOrd
said
it
was
an
inadvisable
purchase
because
the
value
included
of
store
credit
for
an
unavailable
store

German
site
GameStar
noted
that
none
of
the
bonuses
in
that
version
were
available
until
the
launch
period
had
ended
and
refused
to
carry
out
a
full
review

IGN
s
Steve
Butts
compared
the
launch
to
the
poor
state
of
CrimeCraft
s
release
earlier
in
he
indicated
that
features
available
during
League
of
Legends
s
beta
were
removed
for
the
release
even
for
those
who
purchased
the
retail
version

Matches
took
unnecessarily
long
to
find
for
players
with
long
queue
times
and
GameRevolution
mentioned
frustrating
bugs

Some
reviewers
addressed
toxicity
in
the
game
s
early
history

Crecente
wrote
that
the
community
was
insular
and
whiney
when
losing

Butts
speculated
that
League
of
Legends
inherited
many
of
DotA
s
players
who
had
developed
a
reputation
for
being
notoriously
hostile
to
newcomers

Regular
updates
to
the
game
have
resulted
in
a
reappraisal
by
some
outlets
IGN
s
second
reviewer
Leah
B

Jackson
explained
that
the
website
s
original
review
had
become
obsolete


Two
publications
increased
their
original
scores
GameSpot
from
to
and
IGN
from
to




The
variety
offered
by
the
champion
roster
was
described
by
Steven
Strom
of
PC
Gamer
as
fascinating
Jackson
pointed
to
memorable
characters
and
abilities

Although
the
items
had
originally
been
praised
at
release
by
other
outlets
such
as
Kotaku
Jackson
s
reassessment
criticized
the
lack
of
item
diversity
and
viability
noting
that
the
items
recommended
to
the
player
by
the
in
game
shop
were
essentially
required
because
of
their
strength

While
reviewers
were
pleased
with
the
diverse
array
of
play
styles
offered
by
champions
and
their
abilities
Strom
thought
that
the
female
characters
still
resembled
those
in
horny
Clash
of
Clans
clones
in


Two
years
before
Strom
s
review
a
champion
designer
responded
to
criticism
by
players
that
a
young
female
champion
was
not
conventionally
attractive

He
argued
that
limiting
female
champions
to
one
body
type
was
constraining
and
said
progress
had
been
made
in
Riot
s
recent
releases

Comparisons
persisted
between
the
game
and
others
in
the
genre

GameSpot
s
Tyler
Hicks
wrote
that
new
players
would
pick
up
League
of
Legends
quicker
than
DotA
and
that
the
removal
of
randomness
based
skills
made
the
game
more
competitive

Jackson
described
League
of
Legends
rate
of
unlock
for
champions
as
a
model
of
generosity
but
less
than
DotA
s
sequel
Dota
produced
by
Valve
wherein
characters
are
unlocked
by
default

Strom
said
the
game
was
fast
paced
compared
to
Dota
s
yawning
matches
but
slower
than
those
of
Blizzard
Entertainment
s
intentionally
accessible
MOBA
Heroes
of
the
Storm

Player
behavior
League
of
Legends
player
base
has
a
longstanding
reputation
for
toxicity
negative
and
abusive
in
game
behavior
with
a
survey
by
the
Anti
Defamation
League
indicating
that
of
players
have
experienced
in
game
harassment

Riot
Games
has
acknowledged
the
problem
and
responded
that
only
a
small
portion
of
the
game
s
players
are
consistently
toxic

According
to
Jeffrey
Lin
the
lead
designer
of
social
systems
at
Riot
Games
the
majority
of
negative
behavior
is
committed
by
players
occasionally
acting
out


Several
major
systems
have
been
implemented
to
tackle
the
issue

One
such
measure
is
basic
report
functionality
players
can
report
teammates
or
opponents
who
violate
the
game
s
code
of
ethics

The
in
game
chat
is
also
monitored
by
algorithms
that
detect
several
types
of
abuse

An
early
system
was
the
Tribunal
players
who
met
certain
requirements
were
able
to
review
reports
sent
to
Riot

If
enough
players
determined
that
the
messages
were
a
violation
an
automated
system
would
punish
them

Lin
said
that
eliminating
toxicity
was
an
unrealistic
goal
and
the
focus
should
be
on
rewarding
good
player
behavior

To
that
effect
Riot
reworked
the
Honor
system
in
allowing
players
to
award
teammates
with
virtual
medals
following
games
for
one
of
three
positive
attributes

Acquiring
these
medals
increases
a
player
s
Honor
level
rewarding
them
with
free
loot
boxes
over
time

Riot

a

in


Riot
had
previously
experimented
with
releasing
comics
through
its
website

Shannon
Liao
of
The
Verge
noted
that
the
comic
books
were
a
rare
opportunity
for
Riot
to
showcase
its
years
of
lore
that
has
often
appeared
as
an
afterthought


The
first
comic
was
League
of

Ashe
Warmother

debuted
in

by

first
production
for

Riot
Games

studio
Fortiche
Production

In
an
interview
with
The
Hollywood
Reporter
head
of
creative
development
Greg
Street
said
the
series
is
not
a
light
hearted
show

There
are
some
serious
themes
that
we
explore
there
so
we
wouldn
t
want
kids
tuning
in
and
expecting
something
that
it
s
not

The
series
is
set
in
the
utopian
city
of
Piltover
and
its
underground
oppressed
sister
city
Zaun

It
stars
Hailee
Steinfeld
as
Vi
Ella
Purnell
as
Jinx
Kevin
Alejandro
as
Jayce
and
Katie

The
series
was
set
to
be
released
in

the
COVID

Arcane
premiered
its
first
season
on
Netflix
following
the
League
of
Legends
World
Championship
and
was
available
through
Tencent

in
China

It
received
critical
acclaim
upon
release
with
IGN
s
Rafael
Motomayor
asking
rhetorically
if
the
series
marked
the
end
of
the
video
game
adaptation
curse


A
second
and
final
season
was
released
in
November
to
a
similarly
positive
critical
response
