The
Vanishing
hitchhiker
or
variations
such
as
the
ghostly
hitchhiker
the
disappearing
hitchhiker
the
phantom
hitchhiker
or
simply
the
hitchhiker
story
is
an
urban
legend
in
which
people
traveling
by
vehicle
meet
with
or
are
accompanied
by
a
hitchhiker
who
subsequently
vanishes
without
explanation
often
from
a
moving
vehicle

Vanishing
hitchhikers
have
been
reported
for
centuries
and
the
story
is
found
across
the
world
with
many
variants

The
popularity
and
endurance
of
the
legend
has
helped
it
spread
into
popular
culture

The
Vanishing
Hotel
Room
a
k
a

Vanishing
Lady
During
an
international
exposition
in
Paris
a
daughter
leaves
her
mother
in
a
hotel
room
when
she
comes
back
her
mother
is
gone
and
the
hotel
staff
claims
to
have
no
knowledge
of
the
missing
woman

It
is
later
revealed
that
the
mother
was
dying
of
plague
and
fearing
for
the
negative
impact
on
the
hotel
s
public
image
the
staff
just
disposed
of
the
mother
redecorated
the
room
and
pretended
as
if
nothing
had
happened

This
served
as
inspiration
for
the
movie
So
Long
at
the
Fair
and
was
based
on
a
turn
of
the
century
Philadelphia
newspaper
story

Walking
Sam
or
Tall
Man
is
an
urban
legend
that
describes
a
foot
tall
specter
whose

it
is
to

and
stalks
lonely

Walt
Disney
s
Cryo
Chamber
is
an
urban
legend
claiming
that
after
his
death
in
December
Walt
s
body
or
in
some
versions
just
his
head
was
placed
in
a
cryostasis
chamber
located
somewhere
beneath
Disney
World
or
Epcot

The
Water
Babies
of
Massacre
Rocks
originates
from
Idaho
are
a
Native
American
legend
that
are
found
in
a
couple
of
different
places
in
America
but
most
famously
in
Pocatello
at
the
Massacre
Rocks
State
Park

They
are
said
to
be
mischievous
or
malevolent
baby
or
dwarf
like
creatures
with
some
tales
placing
their
origins
as
drowned
Native
American
babies
during
a
famine

The
Well
to
Hell
legend
holds
that
a
team
of
Russian
engineers
purportedly
led
by
an
individual
named
Mr

Azakov
in
an
unnamed
place
in
Siberia
had
drilled
a
hole
that
was


kilometres


mi
deep
before
breaking
through
to
a
cavity

Intrigued
by
this
unexpected
discovery
they
lowered
an
extremely
heat
tolerant
microphone
along
with
other
sensory
equipment
into
the
well

The
temperature
deep
within
was
C
F
heat
from
a
chamber
of
fire
from
which
purportedly
the
tormented
screams
of
the
damned
could
be
heard

The
Duke
of
Wellington
at
Pau
France
first
appeared
in
a
publication
coinciding
with
the
th
anniversary
of
the
founding
of
the
Pau
Hunt
and
quickly
developed
into
a
tale
about
the
origins
of
Fox
hunting
in
B
arn

After
the
Peninsular
War
Wellington
spent
just
one
night
at
Pau
May
stopping
on
the
route
from
Toulouse
to
Madrid

The
tale
of
a
more
lengthy
and
marked
presence
developed
years
later
as
a
prank
that
regular
winter
colonists
played
on
newcomers

The
tale
found
its
way
into
touristic
marketing
publications
memoires
and
academic
publications
during
challenging
times
and
then
despite
contradictory
historical
evidence
it
has
developed
into
Bearnese
folklore

Worldwide
is
difficult
to
find
any
st
century
historical
passage
about
the
th
century
English
colony
at
Pau
that
does
not
cite
some
form
of
this
legend
as
fact

The
wendigo
is
a
Native
American
folklore
legend
that
describes
a
mythological
creature
or
evil
spirit
which
originates
from
the
Algonquin
culture
based
in
and
around
the
East
Coast
forests
of
Canada
the
Great
Plains
region
of
the
United
States
and
the
Great
Lakes
region
of
the
United
States
and
Canada
grouped
in
modern
ethnology
as
speakers
of
Algonquian
family
languages

White

or
sometimes
White
Devils
or
Devil
Dogs
is
a
fictional

ape
or

of
the
Kanawha
River
region
of
West

The
Women
in
Black
of
Wat
Samian
Nari
is
the
story
of
the
ghosts
of
the
beautiful
Thipsuksri
sisters
Chulee
and
Sulee
in
black
dresses

The
sisters
are
believed
to
have
been
crushed
by
a
train
until
their
bodies
were
torn
in
two
in
front
of
Wat
Samian
Nari
temple
Chatuchak
Bangkok
in
the
s

Their
spirits
haunt
people
at
night
especially
taxi
drivers

Most
often
it
is
said
that
a
taxi
picks
up
two
sisters
in
black
from
the
entertainment
district
Ratchadapisek
Road
or
RCA
past
midnight

The
sisters
ask
the
driver
to
bring
them
to
the
Wat
Samian
Nari
temple

Thinking
they
would
go
home
after
hanging
out
there
the
driver
notices
that
they
sit
quietly
not
speaking
to
each
other
or
even
reciprocating
with
him

As
the
taxi
approaches
the
destination
they
mysteriously
vanished
from
the
back
seat

The
cab
driver
steps
out
of
the
car
in
a
daze
suddenly
seeing
the
two
sisters
lying
on
rail
tracks
in
front
of
the
temple
cut
in
half
and
dragging
their
bloodied
torsos
in
