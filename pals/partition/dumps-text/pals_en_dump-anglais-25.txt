these
simple

however
for
your

holds
a
history
of
unexplained
apocalypse
and
the
winter
you
just
survived
was
the
worst
on
record

A
fact
that
has
also
been
true
for
the
previous
five

As

the

the
mysteries
of
the
legends
and
ruins
that
exist
as
much
in
reality
as
in
rumor

will
come
to
see
that
you
are
not
alone

Other
peoples
also
struggle
to
survive
to
grow
and
perhaps
even
to
conquer

You
have
a
city
a
loyal
populace
and
a
few
troops
your
power
and
magic
should
be
sufficient
to
keep
them
alive

But
beyond
that
nothing
is
certain
Where
will
