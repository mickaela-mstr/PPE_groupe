Could
you
clarify
what
s
the
issue
Also
be
aware
that
legend
spacing
y
sets
the
spacing
between
legends
whereas
legend

key

spacing
y
sets
the
spacing
between
the
keys
or
items

Yes
I
get
the
difference
between
legend
spacing
y
and
legend
key
spacing
y

The
publisher
wants
less
space
between
the
key
items
