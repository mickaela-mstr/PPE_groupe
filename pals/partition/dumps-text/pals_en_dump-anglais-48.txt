Lambertville
High
and
the
Legend
of
Buckeye
Mark
and
Mark
August
The
town
of
Lambertville
was
a
great
place
to
grow
up
especially
in
the
s

All
my
friends
and
I
ran
around
in
leather
and
plaid
harassing
tourists
who
came
to
town
to
go
antique
shopping
and
with
mohawks
held
high
in
the
air
we
would
proudly
march
across
the
bridge
to
New
Hope
and
terrorize
anything
and
everything
that
moved

Since
then
I
have
lived
in
a
number
of
places
and
seen
many
strange
things
currently
I
reside
in
a
correctional
facility
but
of
all
of
the
places
I
have
been
and
all
the
things
that
I
have
seen
my
childhood
times
in
L
ville
were
by
far
the
weirdest

Here
s
a
story
that
I
d
like
to
share
with
the
rest
of
my
fellow
New
Jerseyans
High
atop
a
hill
we
affectionately
call
Music
Mountain
sits
the
ruins
of
the
old
Lambertville
High
School

This
is
where
all
the
kids
from
L
ville
and
the
surrounding
areas
went
to
school
before
South
Hunterdon
was
constructed

I
think
it
closed
down
around
and
burned
down
about


What
s
left
of
the
school
still
stands
today
and
is
even
more
creepy
since
the
fire

On
a
chalkboard
on
the
nd
floor
is
an
intricate
drawing
of
children
sitting
in
rows
of
desks
studying
while
flames
rise
up
on
all
sides
of
them

The
floor
is
a
bit
unstable

Behind
the
school
about
feet
through
some
tall
weeds
and
brush
sits
the
old
football
field
still
marked
clearly
by
the
rusty
old
goal
posts

This
is
where
the
weirdness
begins
the
story
of
Buckeye

It
was
a
cold
day
in
the
middle
of
November


Lambertville
High
was
doing
the
usual
on
this
day
getting
ready
for
the
big
game

You
could
hear
the
marching
band
practice
as
you
walked
in
the
front
door

Banners
hung
in
the
hallways
there
was
a
pep
rally
in
the
gymnasium
and
the
thought
of
L
ville
kicking
the
crap
out
of
its
arch
rival
New
Hope
was
on
the
mind
of
every
kid
at
school
that
day

This
was
one
of
the
biggest
days
of
the
year
at
L
H
S

for
whoever
won
the
annual
Turkey
Bowl
would
have
bragging
rights
for
the
rest
of
the
year

p
m

rolled
around
and
everyone
watched
as
the
New
Hope
buses
rolled
up
the
hill
and
pulled
around
back
to
let
out
the
players
onto
the
field

By
the
game
had
started

Both
teams
went
scoreless
the
first
quarter
but
by
the
time
the
half
rolled
around
the
score
was


You
could
almost
smell
the
tension
in
the
air

The
Eagles
L
ville
and
the
Buckeyes
New
Hope
both
did
their
absolute
best
with
the
half
time
show
hoping
to
get
the
crowd
up
and
the
players
into
the
game

The
third
quarter
now
began

New
Hope
had
the
ball
and
was
running
for
the
touchdown
when
the
wide
receiver
from
New
Hope
was
tackled

To
everyone
s
surprise
he
didn
t
get
up

The
coaches
rushed
the
field
but
by
the
time
they
got
there
the
boy
was
dead
his
neck
broken
and
his
head
almost
turned
completely
around

The
game
was
forfeited

The
parents
of
the
boy
who
was
killed
petitioned
that
football
was
too
dangerous
and
that
New
Hope
should
give
it
up

This
accounts
for
the
reason
why
New
Hope
still
doesn
t
have
a
football
team
to
this
day

The
years
went
on
and
the
memory
of
the
poor
Buckeye
that
lost
his
young
life
that
day
faded
from
everyone
s
memory

L
H
S

packed
its
bags
and
headed
up
to
the
new
school
South
Hunterdon

The
old
high
school
became
the
local
hang
out
for
the
greaser
gangs
of
the
day
and
many
of
the
fights
between
L
ville
and
Flemington
or
New
Hope
took
place
up
there

One
night
a
group
of
or
guys
was
hanging
out
on
the
back
steps
when
one
of
the
guys
told
the
story
about
the
Buckeye
who
had
died
there

He
had
heard
it
from
his
uncle
who
had
gone
to
school
there
at
the
time
it
had
happened

The
guys
were
feeling
a
little
rowdy
and
were
a
bit
drunk

They
started
clowning
around
and
joking
about
the
death
and
one
of
them
stood
up
and
proclaimed
I
challenge
Buckeye
to
a
race
across
the
football
field
Everyone
laughed
and
continued
on
with
their
drinking

Pretty
soon
a
cold
wind
started
to
blow
and
everyone
became
silent

From
the
far
end
of
where
the
football
field
once
was
a
pair
of
evil
red
eyes
appeared
in
the
darkness
and
a
voice
whispered
through
the
wind
and
told
the
boys
Run
across
the
football
field
from
end
to
end
or
die
One
of
the
boys
turned
and
started
to
run
when
he
fell
to
the
concrete
cold
and
blue

The
remaining
boys
heard
the
voice
again
so
they
all
lined
up
on
one
side
of
the
field
and
began
to
run
to
the
other
side

They
ran
with
all
that
they
had
and
when
they
finally
reached
the
other
side
another
one
of
the
boys
was
missing

They
all
ran
home
and
locked
the
doors
behind
them
not
saying
a
word
about
what
had
just
happened

The
next
day
when
the
parents
of
the
two
missing
boys
called
the
police
the
bodies
were
discovered
up
at
the
old
high
school
their
heads
almost
turned
completely
around

The
incident
was
blamed
on
a
fight

Signs
were
posted
and
a
chain
link
fence
was
installed
on
the
driveway
of
the
old
school

I
have
been
to
the
old
high
school
more
times
than
I
can
count
and
can
definitely
vouch
that
there
is
a
strange
presence
there

Every
time
I
walk
up
the
old
concrete
steps
a
chill
goes
down
my
spine

A
few
times
during
my
childhood
I
got
up
the
nerve
to
challenge
Buckeye
but
always
halfway
through
the
word
Buckeye
I
would
get
a
crazy
feeling
and
shut
my
mouth
and
head
right
home

Some
people
claim
it
s
just
a
myth
some
say
it
s
real
but
I
can
say
for
sure
it
is
something

So
if
you
decide
to
visit
the
old
school
take
my
advice
don
t
go
there
alone
and
definitely
don
t
go
there
at
night
Johnny

Challenging
Billy
NOT
Buckeye
to
an
Unfriendly
Game
of
Ball
Buckeye
isn
t
the
name
of
the
dead
football
player
that
most
of
the
local
kids
of
Lambertville
remember
it
is
Billy
that
the
ghost
is
called
I
myself
am
a
resident
of
Lambertville
and
spent
many
a
scary
night
drinking
and
partying
in
the
old
place
believe
me
it
is
not
something
to
fool
around
with
The
local
legend
connected
with
Billy
is
that
if
you
go
to
the
old
stairwell
by
the
front
door
leading
into
the
place
and
than
stand
facing
the
front
window
while
standing
between
the
first
and
second
floor
stairway
and
utter
the
words
I
challenge
Billy
to
a
game
of
football


A
football
will
be
thrown
from
the
top
of
the
staircase
by
Billy
breaking
your
neck
in
two
Just
like
what
happened
to
Billy
almost
years
ago
Another
story
about
the
kids
who
challenge
Billy
to
a
game
of
football
is
that
they
will
be
enveloped
by
a
strange
mist
and
then
will
disappear

A
guy
I
know
named
Lem
actually
did
try
to
summon
Billy
on
the
football
field
once
after
a
kid
they
just
met
brought
them
up
there
to
try
it

The
mist
arose
along
with
a
strong
gust
of
wind
and
he
swears
that
he
saw
something
come
charging
across
the
field
to
get
them

They
all
ran
and
nobody
ever
saw
the
mysterious
kid
again
I
asked
my
grandmother
who
actually
went
to
the
school
and
lives
in
the
middle
of
town
near
Mason
s
Bar

She
assured
me
that
the
legend
of
the
boy
being
killed
during
the
middle
of
the
game
was
true
but
his
name
was
Jimmy
Cavallo
not
Billy
or
Buckeye
