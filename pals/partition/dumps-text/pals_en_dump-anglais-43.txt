The
Legend
of
Zelda
a
is
a
media
franchise
created
by
the
Japanese
game
designers
Shigeru
Miyamoto
and
Takashi
Tezuka

It
is
primarily
developed
and
published
by
Nintendo
some
portable
installments
and
re
releases
have
been
outsourced
to
Flagship
Vanpool
Grezzo
and
Tantalus
Media

The
series
centers
on
the
various
incarnations
of
Link
a
courageous
young
man
of
the
elf
like
Hylian
race
and
Princess
Zelda
a
princess
within
the
bloodline
of
the
goddess
Hylia
as
they
fight
to
save
the
land
of
Hyrule
from
Ganon
an
evil
warlord
turned
demon
king
who
is
the
principal
antagonist
of
the
series

Ganon
wishes
to
use
the
Triforce
a
sacred
relic
left
behind
by
the
three
goddesses
that
created
Hyrule
to
remake
the
world
in
his
own
dark
image

When
gathered
together
the
power
of
the
Triforce
can
grant
any
wish
its
user
desires
but
if
someone
with
a
heart
that
does
not
possess
a
balance
of
the
three
virtues
of
Power
Courage
and
Wisdom
attempts
to
touch
the
Triforce
it
will
split
into
three
triangles
and
bond
with
three
people
whose
hearts
embody
the
required
virtue

Although
their
personalities
and
backstory
differ
from
game
to
game
the
incarnations
of
Link
and
Zelda
often
have
many
traits
in
common
such
as
Link
often
being
left
handed
and
clad
in
green
and
Zelda
being
associated
with
wisdom
light
and
prophecy

While
the
conflict
with
Ganon
serves
as
a
backbone
for
the
series
some
games
have
featured
other
settings
and
antagonists
with
Link
traveling
or
being
sent
to
these
other
lands
in
their
time
of
need

Since
The
Legend
of
Zelda
was
released
in
the
series
has
expanded
to
include
entries
on
all
of
Nintendo
s
major
game
consoles
as
well
as
a
number
of
spin
offs

An
American
animated
TV
series
based
on
the
games
aired
in
and
manga
adaptations
commissioned
by
Nintendo
have
been
produced
in
Japan
since


The
Legend
of
Zelda
is
one
of
Nintendo
s
most
successful
franchises
several
of
its
entries
are
considered
among
the
greatest
video
games
of
all
time

Rupees

in
the
series
Gameplay
of
The
Legend
of
Zelda
games
feature
a
mix
of
puzzles
action
adventure
and
exploration

These
elements
have
remained
constant
throughout
the
series
with
refinements
and
additions
featured
in
each
new
game

Later
games
in
the
series
include
stealth
gameplay
where
the
player
must
avoid
enemies
while
proceeding
through
a
level
as
well
as
racing
elements

Although
the
games
can
be
beaten
with
a
minimal
amount
of
exploration
and
side
quests
the
player
is
frequently
rewarded
with
helpful
items
or
increased
abilities
for
solving
puzzles
or
exploring
hidden
areas

Some
items
are
consistent
and
appear
many
times
throughout
the
series
such
as
bombs
and
bomb
flowers
which
can
be
used
both
as
weapons
and
to
open
blocked
or
hidden
doorways
boomerangs
which
can
kill
or
paralyze
enemies
keys
for
locked
doors
magic
swords
shields
and
bows
and
arrows
while
others
are
unique
to
a
single
game

Though
the
games
contain
role
playing
elements
Zelda
II
The
Adventure
of
Link
is
the
only
one
to
include
an
experience
system
they
emphasize
straightforward
hack
and
slash
style
combat
over
the
strategic
turn
based
or
active
time
combat
of
series
like
Final
Fantasy

The
game
s
role
playing
elements
however
have
led
to
much
debate
over
whether
or
not
the
Zelda
games
should
be
classified
as
action
role
playing
games
a
genre
on
which
the
series
has
had
a
strong
influence

Miyamoto
himself
disagreed
with
the
role
playing
label
and
classified
Zelda
as
a
real
time
adventure
game
he
said
that
he
was
not
interested
in
systems
where
everything
in
the
game
is
decided
by
stats
and
numbers
but
wanted
to
preserve
as
much
of
that
live
feeling
as
possible
and
felt
that
action
games
are
better
suited
to
convey
to
players

The
Legend
of
Zelda
often
includes
nonlinear
gameplay
and
varying
environments
in
an
explorable
world
similar
to
this
illustration

Every
game
in
the
main
Zelda
series
has
consisted
of
three
principal
areas
an
overworld
which
connects
all
other
areas
in
which
movement
is
multidirectional
allowing
the
player
some
degree
of
freedom
of
action
areas
of
interaction
with
other
characters
merely
caves
or
hidden
rooms
in
the
first
game
but
expanding
to
entire
towns
and
cities
in
subsequent
games
in
which
the
player
gains
special
items
or
advice
can
purchase
equipment
or
complete
side
quests
and
dungeons
areas
of
labyrinthine
layout
usually
underground
comprising
a
wide
range
of
difficult
enemies
bosses
and
items

Each
dungeon
usually
has
one
major
item
inside
which
can
be
essential
for
solving
many
of
the
puzzles
within
that
dungeon
and
often
plays
a
crucial
role
in
defeating
that
dungeon
s
boss
as
well
as
progressing
through
the
game

In
nearly
every
Zelda
game
navigating
a
dungeon
is
aided
by
locating
a
map
which
reveals
its
layout
and
a
magic
compass
which
reveals
the
location
of
significant
and
smaller
items
such
as
keys
and
equipment

In
later
games
the
dungeon
includes
a
special
big
key
that
will
unlock
the
door
to
battle
the
dungeon
s
boss
enemy
and
open
the
item
chest

In
most
Zelda
games
the
player
s
HP
or
life
meter
is
represented
by
a
line
of
hearts
each
heart
typically
representing
two
hit
points

At
the
start
of
the
game
the
player
only
has
three
hearts
players
can
increase
their
max
hearts
by
finding
heart
shaped
crystals
called
Heart
Containers


Full
heart
containers
are
usually
received
at
the
end
of
dungeons
and
dropped
by
dungeon
bosses

Smaller
Pieces
of
Heart
are
awarded
for
completing
side
quests
or
found
hidden
around
the
game
world
in
various
places
and
require
a
certain
number
usually
four
to
form
a
full
heart
container

Health
can
be
replenished
by
picking
up
hearts
left
by
defeated
enemies
or
destroyed
objects
consuming
items
such
as
potions
or
food
or
going
to
a
Great
Fairy
Fountain
to
have
the
Great
Fairy
heal
Link
completely

Occasionally
the
player
will
find
fairies
hidden
in
specific
locations
these
fairies
can
either
heal
Link
immediately
or
be
kept
in
empty
bottles
and
will
revive
the
player
the
next
time
they
die

The
games
pioneered
a
number
of
features
that
were
to
become
industry
standards

The
original
Legend
of
Zelda
was
the
first
console
game
with
a
save
function
that
enabled
players
to
stop
playing
and
then
resume
later

The
Legend
of
Zelda
Ocarina
of
Time
introduced
a
targeting
system
that
let
the
player
lock
the
camera
on
to
enemy
or
friendly
non
player
characters
which
simplified
D
combat

Shigeru
Miyamoto
series
creator
was
inspired
by
the
hillsides
forests
and
caves
surrounding
his
childhood
home
in
Sonobe
Japan

The
Legend
of
Zelda
was
principally
inspired
by
Shigeru
Miyamoto
s
explorations
as
a
young
boy
in
the
hillsides
forests
and
caves
surrounding
his
childhood
home
in
Sonobe
Japan
where
he
ventured
into
forests
with
secluded
lakes
caves
and
rural
villages

According
to
Miyamoto
one
of
his
most
memorable
experiences
was
the
discovery
of
a
cave
entrance
in
the
middle
of
the
woods

After
some
hesitation
he
apprehensively
entered
the
cave
and
explored
its
depths
with
the
aid
of
a
lantern

Miyamoto
has
referred
to
the
creation
of
the
Zelda
games
as
an
attempt
to
bring
to
life
a
miniature
garden
for
players
to
play
with
in
each
game
of
the
series

The
story
and
setting
were
developed
by
Takashi
Tezuka

Seeking
to
create
a
fairytale
adventure
game
Tezuka
drew
inspirations
from
fantasy
books
such
as
J

R

R

Tolkien
s
The
Lord
of
the
Rings

According
to
Keiji
Terui
who
wrote
the
backstory
in
the
first
game
s
manual
the
location
named
Death
Mountain
was
initially
a
working
title
for
the
legend
of
the
Triforce
which
was
written
with
inspirations
from
the
battles
of
medieval
Europe

The
Master
Sword
was
introduced
as
Excalibur
in
the
French
version
of
A
Link
to
the
Past
which
is
regarded
as
reminiscent
to
the
legend
of
King
Arthur

Celtic
mythology
inspired
the
name
of
Link
s
steed
Epona
based
on
Epona
Celtic
goddess
of
fertility

Hearing
of
American
novelist
socialite
and
painter
Zelda
Fitzgerald
Miyamoto
thought
the
name
sounded
pleasant
and
significant


Paying
tribute
he
chose
to
name
the
princess
after
her
and
titled
it
The
Legend
of
Zelda

Link
and
the
fairy
were
inspired
by
Peter
Pan
and
Tinker
Bell

When
the
series
made
the
transition
to
D
the
combat
system
of
Ocarina
of
Time
was
based
on
the
chanbara
samurai
style
of
Japanese
sword
fighting

Games
in
The
Legend
of
Zelda
series
frequently
feature
in
game
musical
instruments
particularly
in
musical
puzzles
which
are
widespread

Often
instruments
trigger
game
events
for
example
the
recorder
in
The
Legend
of
Zelda
can
reveal
secret
areas
as
well
as
warp
Link
to
the
dungeon
entrances

This
warping
with
music
feature
has
also
been
used
in
A
Link
to
the
Past
and
Link
s
Awakening

In
Ocarina
of
Time
playing
instruments
is
a
core
part
of
the
game
with
the
player
needing
to
play
the
instrument
through
the
use
of
the
game
controller
to
succeed

Ocarina
of
Time
is
one
of
the
first
contemporary
non
dance
title
s
to
feature
music
making
as
part
of
its
gameplay
using
music
as
a
heuristic
device
and
requiring
the
player
to
utilise
songs
to
progress
in
the
game
a
game
mechanic
that
is
also
present
in
Majora
s
Mask

The
Legend
of
Zelda
Theme
is
a
recurring
piece
of
music
that
was
created
for
the
first
game

The
composer
and
sound
director
of
the
series
Koji
Kondo
initially
planned
to
use
Maurice
Ravel
s
Bol
ro
as
the
game
s
title
theme
but
was
forced
to
change
it
when
he
learned
late
in
the
game
s
development
cycle
that
the
copyright
for
the
orchestral
piece
had
not
yet
expired

As
a
result
Kondo
wrote
a
new
arrangement
of
the
overworld
theme
within
one
day

Up
until
Breath
of
the
Wild
the
Legend
of
Zelda
series
avoided
using
voice
acting
in
speaking
roles
relying
instead
on
written
dialogue

Series
producer
Eiji
Aonuma
previously
stated
that
as
Link
is
entirely
mute
having
the
other
characters
speak
while
Link
remains
silent
would
be
off
putting


Instead
of
theme
music
for
different
locations
Breath
of
the
Wild
plays
natural
ambience
around
the
player
as
main
sounds
in
addition
to
some
minimalist
piano
music

The
Legend
of
Zelda
takes
place
predominantly
in
a
medieval
Western
Europe
inspired
fantasy
world
called
Hyrule
which
has
developed
a
deep
history
and
wide
geography
over
the
series
s
many
releases

Much
of
the
backstory
of
the
creation
of
Hyrule
was
revealed
in
the
games
A
Link
to
the
Past
Ocarina
of
Time
The
Wind
Waker
Twilight
Princess
Skyward
Sword
and
A

Hyrule
s
principal
inhabitants
are
pointy
eared
elf
like
humanoids
called
Hylians
which
include
the
player
character
Link
and
the
eponymous
princess
Zelda

The
fictional
universe
established
by
the
Zelda
games
sets
the
stage
for
each
adventure

Some
games
take
place
in
different
lands
with
their
own
back
stories

Hytopia
is
a
connected
kingdom
Labrynna
and
Holodrum
are
different
countries
separate
from
the
Kingdom
of
Hyrule
Termina
and
Lorule
serve
as
parallel
worlds
and

is
an
island
far
away
from
Hyrule
that
appears
to
be
part
of
a
dream

Story
px
Trifuerza
svg
png
The
Triforce
is
represented
as
three
conjoined
golden
triangles

According
to
the
in
game
backstories
the
world
of
Hyrule
was
created
by
the
three
golden
goddesses
Din
Farore
and
Nayru

Before
departing
the
goddesses
left
a
sacred
artifact
called
the
Triforce
which
could
grant
powers
to
the
user

It
physically
manifests
itself
as
three
golden
triangles
in
which
each
embodies
one
of
the
goddesses
virtues
Power
Courage
and
Wisdom

However
because
the
Triforce
has
no
will
of
its
own
and
it
can
not
judge
between
good
and
evil
it
will
grant
any
wish
indiscriminately

Because
of
this
it
was
placed
within
an
alternate
world
called
the
Sacred
Realm
or
the
Golden
Land
until
one
worthy
of
its
power
and
has
balanced
virtues
of
Power
Wisdom
and
Courage
in
their
heart
could
obtain
it
in
its
entirety

If
a
person
is
not
of
a
balanced
heart
the
triforce
part
that
the
user
mostly
believes
in
will
stay
with
that
person
and
the
remainder
will
seek
out
others

In
order
to
master
and
control
the
triforce
as
a
whole
the
user
must
get
the
other
parts
found
in
other
individuals
and
bring
them
together
to
reunite
them

The
Sacred
Realm
can
itself
be
affected
by
the
heart
of
those
who
enter
it
those
who
are
pure
will
make
it
a
paradise
while
those
who
are
evil
will
transform
it
into
a
dark
realm

In
Skyward
Sword
the
Triforce
was
sought
by
the
Demon
King
Demise
an
eternal
being
that
had
conquered
time
itself

After
a
long
battle
against
the
goddess
Hylia
guardian
of
the
Triforce
Demise
was
sealed
away
within
her
temple

Hylia
placing
the
Hylians
on
a
floating
island
in
the
sky
called
Skyloft
to
protect
them
orchestrated
a
means
to
stop
the
demon
from
escaping
creating
the
Goddess
Sword
later
becoming
the
Master
Sword
for
her
chosen
hero
and
discarding
her
divinity
to
be
reborn
among
the
people
of
Skyloft

In
time
Zelda
and
Link
the
reborn
Hylia
and
her
predestined
warrior
enacted
the
goddess
s
plan
and
Demise
was
destroyed
but
he
vowed
that
his
rage
would
be
reborn
and
forever
plague
those
descended
from
Link
and
Zelda

Following
the
establishment
of
Hyrule
Kingdom
Demise
s
prophecy
came
to
fruition
in
Ocarina
of
Time
when
Ganondorf
s
attempt
to
get
the
Triforce
scattered
it
with
him
gaining
the
Triforce
of
Power

The
Triforce
of
Wisdom
ended
up
with
the
Hylian
princesses
descended
from
Zelda
each
named
after
her
while
the
Triforce
of
Courage
is
passed
to
a
youth
named
Link
across
generations

While
the
Triforces
of
Power
and
Wisdom
have
been
part
of
the
series
since
the
original
The
Legend
of
Zelda
it
was
in
Zelda
II
The
Adventure
of
Link
that
the
Triforce
of
Courage
was
introduced
being
obtained
by
Link
at
the
end
of
his
quest

The
Triforce
or
even
a
piece
of
it
is
not
always
distributed
as
a
whole

Such
as
in
The
Wind
Waker
Link
must
find
all
the
pieces
called
Triforce
Shards
of
the
Triforce
of
Courage
before
he
can
return
to
Hyrule

Even
in
the
original
The
Legend
of
Zelda
Zelda
breaks
her
Triforce
of
Wisdom
into
pieces
for
Link
to
find
before
she
was
captured
by
Ganon

The

a
subject
of
much
debate
among
fans
until
an
official
timeline
was
released
within

s
book
first
released
in
Japan
in
December


Prior
to
its

in
a
interview
series
creator
Shigeru
Miyamoto
confirmed
the
existence
of
an
internal
document
which
connected
all
the
games
with

revealing
in

only
Miyamoto

Ocarina
of

a
prequel
to
A
Link
to
the
Past
and
takes
the
story
many
centuries
back
according
to
character
designer
Satoru
Takizawa
it
was
meant
to
implicitly
tell
the

take

after
all
previous
games
in
the
series
without
specifying
a
direct
connection
to
any
of
the
three
timeline
branches

In
the
early
s
Nintendo
of
America
released
a
timeline
on
the
official
website
of
the
series
as
one
of
the
possible
interpretation
of
the
events
from
all
entries
released
up
to
that
point
featuring
a
single
protagonist
named
Link
the
Hero
of
Time
from
its
first
adventure
in
Ocarina
of
Time

It
was
followed
by
Majora
s
Mask
A
Link
to
the
Past
Oracle
of
Seasons
Oracle
of
Ages
the
original
The
Legend
of
Zelda
Zelda
II
The
Adventure
of
Link
and
finally
Link
s
Awakening

In
series
translator
Daniel
Owsen
revealed
that
at
one
point
his
coworkers
at
Nintendo
of
America
and
him
conceived
another
complete
timeline
and
intended
to
make
it
available
online
but
the
Japanese
series
developers
rejected
the
idea
so
that
the
placement
of
each
game
would
be
kept
open
to
the
imagination
of
the
players

On
December
to
celebrate
th
anniversary
of
the
series
the
Hyrule
Historia
art
book
was
published
by
Shogakukan
which
contained
an
official
timeline
of
the
fictional
chronology
of
the
series
up
to
that
point

This
timeline
subsequently
posits
that
following
Ocarina
of
Time
it
splits
into
three
alternate
routes
in
one
Ganon
is
not
defeated
leading
into
the
Imprisoning
War
and
A
Link
to
the
Past
Oracle
of
Seasons
and
Oracle
of
Ages
Link
s
Awakening
A
Link
Between
Worlds
Tri
Force
Heroes
and
Echoes
of
Wisdom
were
released
after
the
timeline
The
Legend
of
Zelda
and
The
Adventure
of
Link

The
second
and
third
where
Ganon
is
defeated
by
Link
lead
to
a
split
timeline
between
his
childhood
where
Zelda
sends
him
back
in
time
so
he
can
use
the
wisdom
he
has
gained
to
warn
young
Zelda
of
the
horrifying
fate
of
Hyrule
and
adulthood
where
adult
Zelda
lives
on
to
try
and
rebuild
her
kingdom


His
childhood
continues
with
Majora
s
Mask
followed
by
Twilight
Princess
and
Four
Swords
Adventures

The
timeline
from
his
adult
life
continues
into
Wind
Waker
Phantom
Hourglass
and
Spirit
Tracks

In
Nintendo
revealed
Breath
of
the
Wild
s
timeline
placement
after
all
previous
games
in
the
series
without
specifying
a
connection
to
any
of
the
three
timeline
branches

Aonuma
and
Breath
of
the
Wild
director
Hidemaro
Fujibayashi
justified
the
vague
placement
with
the
previous
idea
of
keeping
it
open
to
players
imaginations

Nintendo
moved
Link
s
Awakening
to
take
place
before
Oracle
of
Seasons
and
Oracle
of
Ages

In
Nintendo
released
Hyrule
Warriors
Age
of
Calamity
a
gameplay
wise
sequel
to
the
spin
off
game
Hyrule
Warriors
marketed
as
a
prequel
to
Breath
of
the
Wild
being
set
years
before
but
the
events
of
Age
of
Calamity
diverged
from
the
backstory
established
in
Breath
of
the
Wild
creating
an
alternate
timeline
separate
from
it

Main
article
Link
The
Legend
of
Zelda
The
central
protagonist
of
The
Legend
of
Zelda
series
Link
is
the
name
of
various
young
male
Hylians
who
characteristically
wear
a
green
tunic
and
a
pointed
cap
and
are
the
bearers
of
the
Triforce
of
Courage

In
most
games
the
player
can
give
Link
a
different
name
before
the
start
of
the
adventure
and
he
will
be
referred
by
that
given
name
throughout
by
the
non
player
characters
NPCs


Miyamoto
said
in
a
interview
that
he
named
the
protagonist
Link
because
the
character
is
was
supposed
to
be
the
link
between
the
player
and
the
game
world

The
various
Links
each
have
a
special
title
such
as
Hero
of
Time
Hero
of
Winds
or
Hero
of
the
Wild


Like
many
silent
protagonists
in
video
games
Link
does
not
speak
only
producing
grunts
yells
etc

but
he
is
not
mute
dialogue
from
him
is
referenced
second
hand
by
in
game
characters
despite
not
being
seen
or
heard
by
the
player

Link
is
depicted
as
a
silent
protagonist
so
that
the
audience
is
able
to
have
their
own
thoughts
as
to
how
their
Link
would
answer
the
characters
instead
of
him
having
scripted
responses

Princess
Zelda
Main
article
Princess
Zelda
Princess
Zelda
is
the
princess
of
Hyrule
and
the
guardian
of
the
Triforce
of
Wisdom

Her
name
is
present
in
many
of
her
female
ancestors
and
descendants

While
most
games
require
Link
to
save
Zelda
from
Ganon
she
sometimes
plays
a
supporting
role
in
battle
using
magical
powers
and
weapons
such
as
Light
Arrows
to
aid
Link

With
the
exception
of
the
CD
i
games
she
was
not
playable
in
the
main
series
until
Spirit
Tracks
where
she
becomes
a
spirit
and
can
possess
a
Phantom
Knight
that
can
be
controlled
by
the
player

Zelda
appears
under
various
other
aliases
and
alter
egos
including
Sheik
in
Ocarina
of
Time
and
Tetra
in
The
Wind
Waker
and
Phantom
Hourglass


In
Skyward
Sword
it
is
revealed
that
the
Zelda
of
that
game
is
a
reincarnation
of
the
goddess
Hylia
whose
power
flows
through
the
royal
bloodline

The
name
Zelda
derives
from
the
American
novelist
Zelda
Fitzgerald

Ganon
Main
article
Ganon
Ganon
also
known
as
Ganondorf
in
his
humanoid
form
is
the
main
antagonist
and
the
final
boss
in
the
majority
of
The
Legend
of
Zelda
games

In
the
series
Ganondorf
is
the
leader
of
a
race
of
desert
brigands
called
the
Gerudo
which
consists
entirely
of
female
warriors
save
for
one
man
born
every
one
hundred
years

He
is
significantly
taller
than
other
human
NPCs
but
his
looks
vary
between
games
often
taking
the
form
of
a
monstrous
anthropomorphic
boar

His
specific
motives
vary
from
game
to
game
but
most
often
his
plans
include
him
kidnapping
Princess
Zelda
and
planning
to
achieve
domination
of
Hyrule
and
presumably
the
world
beyond
it

To
this
end
he
seeks
the
Triforce
a
powerful
magical
relic

He
often
possesses
a
portion
of
the
Triforce
called
the
Triforce
of
Power
which
gives
him
great
strength
but
it
is
often
not
enough
to
accomplish
his
ends
leading
him
to
hunt
the
remaining
Triforce
pieces

Unlike
Link
Zelda
and
most
other
recurring
characters
he
is
actually
the
same
person
in
every
game
with
the
exception
of
Four
Swords
Adventures
where
he
is
a
reincarnation
of
the
original

In
each
game
the
battles
with
him
are
different
and
he
fights
using
different
styles

The
game
Skyward
Sword
indicates
that
Ganon
is
a
reincarnation
of
an
evil
deity
known
as
Demise

The

and
later
Zelda

Nintendo
never
acknowledged
them
in
the
Zelda
timeline
and
they
are
considered
to
be
in
a
separate
self
contained
canon

These
games
are
widely
acknowledged
to
be
the
worst
installments
in
the
series
though
have
since
gained
a
cult
following
in
the

of

memes

The

In

Ocarina
of
Time
released
in
for
the
Nintendo
was
the
first
D
game
in
the
series

After
five
years
without
a
new
game
the
series
made
the
transition
to
D
with
Ocarina
of
Time
for
the
Nintendo
which
was
released
in
November


This
game
initially
known
as
Zelda
retains
the
core
gameplay
of
the
previous
D
games
and
was
very
successful
commercially
and
critically
considered
by
many
critics
and
gamers
to
be
the
best
video
game
of
all
time
and
ranking
highly
on
IGN
and
EGM
s
greatest
games
of
all
time
lists
as
well
as
scoring
perfect
scores
in
several
video
game
publications

In
February
it
was
ranked
by
Nintendo
Power
as
the
best
game
released
for
a
Nintendo
console

The
game
was
originally
developed
for
the
poorly
selling
Japanese
only
DD
but
was
converted
to
cartridge
format
when
the
DD
hardware
was
delayed

A
new
gameplay
mechanic
lock
on
targeting
is
used
in
the
game
which
focuses
the
camera
on
a
nearby
target
and
alters
the
player
s
actions
relative
to
that
target

Such
mechanics
allow
precise
sword
fighting
in
a
D
space

The
game
heavily
uses
context
sensitive
button
play
which
enabled
the
player
to
control
various
actions
with
Link
using
only
one
button
on
the
Nintendo
s
controller

Each
action
was
handled
slightly
differently
but
all
used
the
A
button
to
perform

For
instance
standing
next
to
a
block
and
pressing
A
made
Link
grab
it
enabling
him
to
push
pull
it
but
moving
forwards
into
a
block
and
pressing
A
allowed
Link
to
climb
the
block

The
game
featured
the
first
appearance
of
Link
s
horse
Epona
allowing
Link
to
travel
quickly
across
land
and
fire
arrows
from
horseback

Those
who
preordered
the
game
received
a
gold
colored
cartridge
in
a
limited
edition
box
with
a
golden
plastic
card
affixed
reading
Collector
s
Edition


In
some
stores
that
had
this
Collector
s
Edition
quickly
sell
out
a
small
and
rare
Zelda
pin
was
given
instead

It
is
the
sword
and
shield
emblem
with
Zelda
written
on
it

Very
few
of
them
are
known
to
remain

Ocarina
of
Time
was
re
released
on
the
GameCube
in
when
it
was
offered
as
a
pre
order
incentive
for
The
Wind
Waker
in
the
U
S

Canada
and
Japan

It
includes
the
cancelled
DD
expansion
for
Ocarina
of
Time
known
as
Ura
Zelda
during
development

Named
Ocarina
of
Time
Master
Quest
the
game
was
given
reorganized
dungeon
layouts
for
greater
difficulty

Europe
continued
to
receive
this
Two
Game
Bonus
Disc
free
in
every
copy
of
The
Wind
Waker
except
for
the
discounted
Player
s
Choice
version

Ocarina
of
Time
was
available
through
the
Wii
s
Virtual
Console
service

Nintendo
re
released
it
for
the
Wii
U
Virtual
Console
in
July


Ocarina
of
Time
D
for
the
DS
featuring
remade
graphics
and
stereoscopic
D
was
released
in
mid
June


Ocarina
of
Time
has
been
made
available
on
the
higher
tier
of
Nintendo
Switch
Online
in
HD
resolution

Ocarina
of
Time
s
follow
up
Majora
s
Mask
was
released
in
April


It
uses
the
same
D
game
engine
as
the
previous
game
and
added
a
time
based
concept
in
which
Link
the
protagonist
relives
the
events
of
three
days
as
many
times
as
needed
to
complete
the
game
s
objectives

It
was
originally
called
Zelda
Gaiden
a
Japanese
title
that
translates
as
Zelda
Side
story

Gameplay
changed
significantly
in
addition
to
the
time
limit
Link
can
use
masks
to
transform
into
creatures
with
unique
abilities

While
Majora
s
Mask
retains
the
graphical
style
of
Ocarina
of
Time
it
is
also
a
departure
particularly
in
its
atmosphere

It
features
motion
blur
unlike
its
predecessor

The
game
is
darker
in
tone
dealing
with
death
and
tragedy
in
a
manner
not
previously
seen
in
the
series
and
has
a
sense
of
impending
doom
as
a
large
moon
slowly
descends
upon
the
land
of
Termina
to
destroy
all
life

All
copies
of
Majora
s
Mask
are
gold
cartridges

A
limited
Collector
s
Edition
lenticular
cartridge
label
was
offered
as
the
pre
order
incentive

Copies
of
the
game
that
are
not
collector
s
editions
feature
a
normal
sticker
cartridge
label

Majora
s
Mask
was
available
on
the
Wii
and
Wii
U
Virtual
Console
catalogues

The
Legend
of
Zelda
Majora
s
Mask
D
was
released
for
DS
in
North
America
Europe
Japan
and
Australia
in
February


The
Nintendo
version
was
added
to
Nintendo
Switch
Online
in
February
with
this
all
of
the
D
games
in
the
series
have
been
re
released
in
HD
resolution

Oracle
of
Seasons
and
Oracle
of
Ages
were
released
simultaneously
for
the
Game
Boy
Color
in
and
interact
using
passwords
or
a
Game
Link
Cable

After
one
game
has
been
completed
the
player
is
given
a
password
that
allows
the
other
game
to
be
played
as
a
sequel

They
were
developed
by
Flagship
in
conjunction
with
Nintendo
with
supervision
from
Miyamoto

After
the
team
experimented
with
porting
the
original
The
Legend
of
Zelda
to
the
Game
Boy
Color
they
decided
to
make
an
original
trilogy
to
be
called
the
Triforce
Series


When
the
password
system
linking
the
three
games
proved
too
troublesome
the
concept
was
reduced
to
two
games
at
Miyamoto
s
suggestion

These
two
games
became
Oracle
of
Ages
which
is
more
puzzle
based
and
Oracle
of
Seasons
which
is
more
action
oriented

Both
titles
were
later
released
on
the
DS
Virtual
Console
and
Nintendo
Switch
Online

The
Wind
Waker
released
in
for
the
GameCube
was
the
first
game
in
the
series
featuring
cel
shading

When
Nintendo
revealed
the
GameCube
on
August
the
day
before
Nintendo
s
Space
World
exposition
a
software
demonstration
showed
a
realistically
styled
real
time
duel
between
Ganondorf
and
Link

Fans
and
the
media
speculated
that
the
battle
might
be
from
a
Zelda
game
in
development
at
the
time

At
Space
World
Nintendo
showed
a
cel
shaded
Zelda
game
later
released
as
The
Wind
Waker
in
December


Due
to
poor
reception
nothing
further
was
shown
until
a
playable
demonstration
was
ready

Miyamoto
felt
The
Wind
Waker
would
extend
Zelda
s
reach
to
all
ages


The
gameplay
centers
on
controlling
wind
with
a
baton
called
the
Wind
Waker
and
sailing
a
small
boat
around
an
island
filled
ocean
retaining
similar

the
handheld
Four

Four
Swords
Adventures
was
another
deviation
from
previous
Zelda
gameplay
focusing
on
level
based
and
multiplayer
gameplay

The
game
contains
levels
and
a
map
screen
there
is
no
connecting
overworld

For
multiplayer
features
each
player
must
use
a
Game
Boy
Advance
system
linked
to
the
GameCube
via
a
Nintendo
GameCube
Game
Boy
Advance
link
cable

The
game
features
a
single
player
campaign
in
which
using
a
Game

is
optional

Four
Swords
Adventures
includes
two
gameplay
modes
Hyrulean
Adventure
with
a
plot
and
gameplay
similar
to
other
Zelda
games
and
Shadow
Battle
in
which
multiple
Links
played
by
multiple
players
battle
each

The
Japanese

include
an
exclusive
third
segment
Navi
Trackers
originally
designed
as
the
stand
alone
game
Tetra
s
Trackers
which
contains
spoken
dialogue
for
most

and
later
in
December
as
the
last
Nintendo
published
game
for
the
GameCube
the
console
for
which
it
was
originally
developed

The
Wii
version
features
motion
controls
and
a
reversed
world
where
everything
that
is
in
the
west
on
the
GameCube
is
in
the
east
on
the
Wii

The
display
is
mirrored
in
order
to
make
Link
right
handed
to
make
use
of
the
Wii
Remote
feel
more
natural
for
the
majority
of
players

The
game
chronicles
the
struggle
of
a
young
adult
Link
to
confront
the
troubles
of
the
Twilight
Realm
a
mysterious
force
that
appears
around
and
interacts
with

When
he
enters
this
realm
he
is
transformed
into
a
wolf
and
loses
the
ability
to
use
his

shield
or
other
items

gains
other
abilities
such
as
sharpened

main

games
as
well
as
re

of

Courage
for
Game
Boy
Color

Working
with
Capcom
s
subsidiary
Flagship
Yoshiki
Okamoto
was
originally
tasked
with
designing
a
series
of
three
Zelda
games
for
the
Game
Boy
Color

Referred
to
as
the
Triforce

the

The

Acorn
Chapter
of

Chapter

The
Legend
of
Zelda
Mystical
Seed
of
Power
Mystical
Seed
of
Wisdom
and
Mystical
Seed
of
Courage
in
the
US

The
games
were
to
interact
using
a
password
system
but
the
limitations
of
this
system
and
the
difficulty
of
coordinating
three
games
proved
too
complicated
so
the
team
scaled
back
to
two
games
at
Miyamoto
s
suggestion

The
Legend
of
Zelda
Oracle
of
Seasons
was
adapted
from
Mystical
Seed
of

of

Seed
of
Courage

and
Samus
from

planned
to
be
playable
characters
for

of

not
make

in


Nintendo
of
Japan
s
president
Satoru
Iwata
and
Shigeru

against

two

in

One
was
an
untitled

Another
one
was
titled

and
December
could

the
fact
that
they
star
the
Hero
of

animation
for

and
Astro

created
a
pitch
reel
for
a
computer
animated
The
Legend

film

Nintendo
did
not
accept
the
studio
s
offer
due
to
the
memory
of
the
failure
of
the
live
action
film
adaptation
of
Super
Mario
Bros

In
Aonuma
said
that
if

use
the
opportunity
to
embrace
audience
interaction
in
some
capacity

was
said
that
Nintendo
was
close
to
closing
a
deal

Pictures
to
produce
a
film
adaptation
of
the
franchise
following
the
success
of
their
film
The
Super
Mario
Bros

Movie
but
Illumination
CEO
Chris
Meledandri
denied
these
reports
later
that
month

By
November
Nintendo
was
developing
a
live
action
Legend
of
Zelda
film
with
Sony
Pictures
which
will
co
finance
and
distribute
the
project
worldwide

Wes
Ball
has
been
attached
to
direct
the
film
and
Shigeru
Miyamoto
and
Avi
Arad
will
be
producing
alongside
Ball
and
his
producing
partner
Joe
Hartwick
Jr

through
their
Oddball
Entertainment
company

Although
the
casting
had
not
been
announced
Patricia
Summersett
who
had
previously
done
voice
work
for
Princess
Zelda
said
that
she
would
like
to
