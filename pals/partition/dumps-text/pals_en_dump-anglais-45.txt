The
title
that
Nintendo
chose
for
the
series
has
led
to
a
lot
of
confusion
even
now
with
people
still
confusing
Zelda
and
Link

Basically
through
the
long
and
short
of
it
the
primary
focus
of
every
game
is
on
Link
so
the
title
does
seem
a
little
off
but
Legend
of
Link
doesn
t
quite
have
the
same
ring
to
it
not
to
mention
the
confusion
of
LoL
and
lol
they
somehow
preempted
that
by
years
But
Zelda
is
just
as
much
an
important
character
in
the
series
as
Link
and
even
Ganon
or
Ganondorf
so
does
the
title
link
itself
to
more
than
just
a
character

The
first
The
Legend
of
Zelda
game
was
focused
on
rescuing
Zelda
from
the
clutches
of
Gannon
as
his
name
was
originally
spelt

The
decision
to
name
the
game
after
the
princess
instead
of
the
player
is
probably
due
in
large
part
to
the
ability
to
pick
your
own
name

The
argument
over
many
years
for
Link
to
have
no
voice
was
that
the
player
is
meant
to
feel
like
they
aren
t
controlling
another
character
but
instead
are
a
part
of
the
game

In
the
immediate
sequel
they
dropped
The
Legend
and
opted
for
Zelda
II
The
Adventure
of
Link

This
sequel
wasn
t
as
well
received
so
as
they
continued
with
the
series
perhaps
it
was
a
marketing
decision
to
draw
the
attention
of
fans
of
the
original

As
for
what
The
Legend
is
you
have
to
look
at
the
first
game
in
the
timeline
The
Legend
of
Zelda
Skyward
Sword

In
that
game
this
Zelda
is
not
a
princess
but
the
first
human
mortal
reincarnation
of
the
goddess
Hylia

This
is
further
explained
at
the
back
of
the
Hyrule
Historia
book
in
a
translated
manga
titled
The
Legend
is
Born
a
page
of
which
I
have
taken
a
photo
of

Whenever
the
land
of
Hylia
is
in
danger
we
shall
be
reborn
Long
story
short
Zelda
is
the
reincarnation
of
Hylia
the
goddess
of
the
world
seen
in
the
games

Link
while
important
is
a
creation
of
Hylia
not
a
god
himself

I
think
it
s
fair
to
say
that
at
the
time
of
release
of
the
first
game
the
legend
simply
was
the
story
of
the
game

Tons
of
games
were
called
legend
of
something
at
the
time
and
those
were
always
games
where
the
story
was
the
legend
the
title
referred
to

Zelda
was
no
exception

and
then
it
became
a
loooong
legend

collection

Maybe
the

should

There
really
is
an
in
universe
Legend
of
Zelda
mentioned
in
the
instruction
manual
of
Zelda
II
as
told
by
Impa
Link
the
time
has
come
when
I
must
tell
you
the
legend
of
Zelda
handed
down
in
Hyrule

It
is
said
that
long
ago
when
Hyrule
was
one
country
a
great
ruler
maintained
the
peace
in
Hyrule
using
the
Triforce

However
the
king
too
was
a
child
of
man
and
he
died

Then
the
prince
of
the
kingdom
should
have
become
king
and
inherited
everything
but
he
could
inherit
the
Triforce
only
in
part

The
prince
searched
everywhere
for
the
missing
parts
but
could
not
find
them

Then
a
magician
close
to
the
king
brought
him
some
unexpected
news

Before
he
died
the
king
had
said
something
about
the
Triforce
to
only
the
younger
sister
of
the
prince
Princess
Zelda

The
prince
immediately
questioned
the
princess
but
she
wouldn
t
tell
him
anything

After
the
prince
the
magician
threatened
to
put
the
princess
into
an
eternal
sleep
if
she
did
not
talk
but
even
still
she
said
nothing

In
his
anger
the
magician
tried
to
cast
a
magic
spell
on
the
princess

The
surprised
prince
tried
to
stop
him
but
the
magician
fought
off
the
prince
and
went
on
chanting
the
spell

Then
when
the
spell
was
finally
cast
Princess
Zelda
fell
on
that
spot
and
entered
a
sleep
from
which
she
might
never
awake

At
the
same
time
the
magician
also
fell
down
and
breathed
his
last

In
his
grief
the
prince
placed
the
princess
in
this
room

He
hoped
that
someday
she
would
come
back
to
life

So
that
this
tragedy
would
never
be
forgotten
he
ordered
that
every
female
child
born
into
the
royal
household
shall
be
given
the
name
Zelda

And
although
Zelda
II
may
be
one
of
the
lesser
popular
entries
of
the
series
today
did
sell
less
than
the
original
it
was
actually
fairly
well
received
in
its
day
and
remained
in
Nintendo
Power
s
Top
Players
Picks
lists
for
a
good
five
years
regularly
placing
in
the
former
even
up
to
December

Thanks
for
your

It
s
actually
interesting
to
see
the
two
versions
of
the
same

which
are
both
legitimate

My
only
recommendation
would
be
to
re
word
your
last
paragraph
accusing
other
users
of
being
wrong
whether
true
or
not
often

You
re

and
thanks
for
the
advice

Sorry
if
my
last
paragraph
came
across
as
confrontational

I
reworded
it
to
be
a
bit
more
civil

I
didn
t
mean
to
criticize
Gwellin
s
answer
but
I
admit
I
do
get
irked
when
Zelda
II
is
treated
as
an
outcast
of
sorts
even
by
the
game
s
own
developers
when
looking
back
the
game
was
actually
received
rather
well

I
appreciate
it

I
thought
of
pointing
out
my
wording
and
intentions
but
didn
t
take
offence

Zelda
II
is
a
good
game
that
suffers
from
being
too
different
from
what
everyone
expected
which
tends
to
mean
fewer
people
give
it
a
try

I
know
some
intense
fans
of
Zelda

and
have
learnt
to
appreciate
the
game
much

This
was
found
within
the
initial
game
The
Legend
of
Zelda
Many
years
ago
Prince
Darkness
Gannon
stole
one
of
the
Triforce
with
Power

Princess
Zelda
had
one
of
the
Triforce
with
Wisdom

She
divided
it
into
units
to
hide
it
from
Gannon
before
she
was
captured

Go
find
the
units
Link
to
save
her

To
see
this
all
you
had
to
do
was
wait
at
the
title
screen

Simply
do
not
press
the
Start
button
on
the
title
screen

The
music
will
get
a
bit
more
up
beat
and
this
will
scroll
onto
the
screen
for
a
bit

You
could
say
that
the
title
at
the
top
of
this
screen
represented
the
name
of
the
game
but
I
always
thought
of
this
text
as
the
simplified
summarized
version
of
the
legend

The
instruction
manual
for
the
first
game
introduced
a
slightly
longer
backstory
noting
Link
saved
a
woman
named
Impa
who
told
Link
this
information

A
long
long
time
ago
the
World
was
in
an
age
of
Chaos

In
the
middle
of
this
chaos
in
a
little
kingdom
in
the
land
of
Hyrule
a
legend
was
being
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
the
legend
of
the
Triforce
golden
triangles
possessing
mystical
powers

One
day
an
evil
army
attacked
this
peaceful
little
kingdom
and
stole
the
Triforce
of
Power

This
army
was
led
by
Gannon
the
powerful
Prince
of
Darkness
who
sought
to
plunge
the
World
into
fear
and
darkness
under
his
rule

Fearing
his
wicked
rule
Zelda
the
princess
of
this
kingdom
split
up
the
Triforce
of
Wisdom
into
eight
fragments
and
hid
them
throughout
the
realm
to
save
the
last
remaining
Triforce
from
the
clutches
of
the
evil
Ganon

At
the
same
time
she
commanded
her
most
trustworthy
nursemaid
Impa
to
secretly
escape
into
the
land
and
go
find
a
man
with
enough
courage
to
destroy
the
evil
Gannon

Upon
hearing
this
Ganon
grew
angry
imprisoned
the
princess
and
sent
out
a
party
in
search
of
Impa

Braving
forests
and
mountains
Impa
fled
for
her
life
from
her
pursuers

As
she
reached
the
very
limit
of
her
energy
she
found
herself
surrounded
by
Gannon
s
evil
henchmen

Cornered
What
could
she
do
But
wait
All
was
not
lost

A
young
lad
appeared

He
skillfully
drove
off
Ganon
s
henchmen
and
saved
Impa
from
a
fate
worse
than
death

His
name
was
Link

During
his
travels
he
had
come
across
Impa
and
Ganon
s
henchmen

Impa
told
Link
the
whole
story
of
the
princess
Zelda
and
the
evil
Ganon

Burning
with
a
sense
of
justice
Link
resolved
to
save
Zelda
but
Ganon
was
a
powerful
opponent

He
held
the
Triforce
of
Power

And
so
in
order
to
fight
off
Ganon
Link
had
to
bring
the
scattered
eight
fragments
of
the
Triforce
of
Wisdom
together
to
rebuild
the
mystical
Triangle

If
he
couldn
t
do
this
there
would
be
no
chance
Link
could
fight
his
way
into
Death
Mountain
where
Ganon
lived

Can
Link
really
destroy
Ganon
and
save
the
Princess
Zelda
Only
your
skill
can
answer
that
question

Good
luck

Use
the
Triforce
wisely
