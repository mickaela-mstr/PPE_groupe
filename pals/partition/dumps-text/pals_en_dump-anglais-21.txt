Here
is
one
work
with
legend
text
getting
cut
off
or
when
you
have
long
legend
values


Turn
off
legends
on
the
various
visuals
you
want
to
display


Create
a
Treemap
visual
with
same
data
columns

Place
its
legend
on
Top
Left


Reduce
height
of
the
Tree
Map
visual
so
that
only
the
Legend
displays

I
set
it
to
px
and
only
the
legend
was
showing

I
set
the
width
of
the
tree
map
visual
as
wide
as
possible
to
accomodate
long
values
in
my
Legend
s
data
category

Hope
this
helps

That
s
right
buddy
MFelix


Though
I
am
asking
for
something
such
as
a
legend
wrap
since
I
have
quite
a
few
categories
and
can
t
go
about
expanding
the
graph
size

The
other
obvious
way
around
it
is
placing
the
legend
to
the
left
or
right
though
I
need
it
at
the
bottom
center

In
Excel
for
example
the
legend
can
be
fit
in
two
three
parallel
lines

Don
t
see
that
happening
here

Hi
Anonymous
There
is
no
such
option
for
legend
wrap
in
Power
BI
now


I
suggest
you
create
an
idea
for
it
in
https
ideas
powerbi
com
forums
power

ideas
to
improve
the
Power

As
a
workaround
you
can
create
a
custom
legend
by
column
chart

For
detailed
steps
you
can
refer
to

Hi
Anonymous
There
is
no
option
on
the
legends
for
wraping
values
one
option
can
be
to
make
some
sort
of
a
table
or
matrix
visualization
and
used
it
as
your
legend
if
you
group
the
two
together
the
final
user
won
t
realize
they
are
looking
at
different
visuals
however
this
depends
on
the
data
