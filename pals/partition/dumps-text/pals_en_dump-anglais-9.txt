Being
born
on
March
and
having
an
Irish
surname
leads
me
to
have
more
reflections
and
conversations
about
St

Patrick
s
Day
than
the
average
person
as
I
wrote
two
years
ago

This
time
we
re
going
to
look
at
some
of
the
myths
related
to
the
man
St

Patrick

Shamrocks
Legend
has
it
that
British
born
St

Patrick
used
a
shamrock
to
teach
Irish
pagans
about
the
trinity

However
there
s
a
few
problems
with
this
The
word
shamrock
doesn
t
come
into
use
until
a
thousand
years
after
St

Patrick
s
death
and
it
took
nearly
as
long
for
this
legend
to
develop

There
s
disagreement
on
if
there
actually
is
such
a
thing
as
a
shamrock
and
if
it
they
exist
if
they
re
capable
of
growing
in
non
Irish
soil

Most
significantly
St

Patrick
never
alludes
to
anything
like
this
in
his
only
two
extant
writings
the
Confessio
and
the
Epistola

Aside
from
these
two
documents
we
really
don
t
know
anything
else
about
Ireland
s
British
Bishop

Snakes
Ever
heard
about
St

Patrick
chasing
all
the
snakes
out
of
Ireland
Uh
uh

Nope

Didn
t
happen
since
the
island
never
had
snakes

And
again
he
never
wrote
anything
about
chasing
killing
or
even
screaming
and
running
away
from
snakes

Nobody
mentions
this
legend
until
years
after
the
approximate
date
of
his
death

And
about
that
date

March
is
said
to
be
St

Patrick
s
date
of
death
not
birth

Nobody
recorded
the
date
it
just
showed
up
on
liturgical
calendar
centuries
later

Slavery
Patrick
s
father
had
a
successful
business
enriched
by
slave
labor

Ironically
Patrick
was
kidnapped
from
Britain
and
sold
into
slavery
in
Ireland
at
age


After
six
years
a
slave
Patrick
escaped
back
to
Britain

He
trained
for
the
ministry
and
dreamed
that
God
was
calling
him
to
go
back
to
preach
in
Ireland

He
was
enslaved
again
for
a
short
period
of
time
but
Patrick
refused
to
be
deterred
from
his
purpose
describing
himself
as
being
bound
by
the
Spirit
to
minister
in
the
land
of
his
captivity

Souls
over
Gold
As
soon
as
Valentine
s
Day
ends
naked
cupids
are
displaced
by
leprechauns
clothed
thankfully
on
retail
shelves

Is
this
a
case
of
Roman
icons
being
gentrified
by
Irish
ones
Anyway
the
clever
little
creatures
with
pots
of
gold
at
the
end
of
rainbows
have
nothing
to
do
with
St

Patrick

This
saint
developed
a
love
for
souls
over
gold
and
argued
for
people
to
be
prized
over
possessions

St

Patrick
wrote
his
fiery
Epistola
as
a
call
for
repentance
and
reparations
from
those
who
had
killed
enslaved
and
sold
women
and
men
he
had
just
baptized
and
anointed

In
doing
so
he
was
putting
his
life
on
the
line
for
a
wholistic
ministry

He
wasn
t
satisfied
with
people
s
soul
s
being
saved
while
their
bodies
were
in
bondage
It
is
not
that
I
would
choose
to
let
anything
so
blunt
and
harsh
come
from
my
mouth
but
I
am
driven
by
the
zeal
for
God

And
the
truth
of
Christ
stimulates
me
for
love
of
neighbors
and
children
for
these
I
have
given
up
my
homeland
and
my
parents
and
my
very
life
to
death
The
Most
High
does
not
accept
the
gifts
of
evildoers

The
one
who
offers
a
sacrifice
taken
from
what
belongs
to
the
poor
is
like
one
who
sacrifices
a
child
in
the
very
sight
of
the
child
s
father

Riches
says
Scripture
which
a
person
gathers
unjustly
will
be
vomited
out
of
that
person
s
stomach

The
angel
of
death
will
drag
such
a
one
away
to
be
crushed
by
the
anger
of
dragons

St

Patrick
continued
by
urging
his
followers
to
resist
flattering
these
traffickers
and
to
boycott
them
instead
A
ll
the
holy
and
humble
of
heart
should
not
fawn
on
such
people
nor
even
share
food
or
drink
with
them
nor
accept
their
alms
until
such
time
as
they
make
satisfaction
to
God
in
severe
penance
and
shedding
of
tears
and
until
they
set
free
the
men
servants
of
God
and
the
baptised
women
servants
of
Christ
for
whom
he
died
and
was
crucified

Shouldn
t
commemorations
of
St

Patrick
s
legacy
set
higher
goals
than
wearing
green
clothes
eating
green
cookies
and
cupcakes
and
turning
rivers
green
for
a
day
Why
not
draft
modern
versions
of
the
Epistola
instead
of
getting
drunk
on
green
beer
