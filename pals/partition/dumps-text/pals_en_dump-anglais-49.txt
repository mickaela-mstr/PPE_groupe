is
a
Japanese
media
franchise
consisting
of
video
games
animated
series
and
films
a
trading
card
game
and
other
related
media

The
franchise
takes
place
in
a
shared
universe
in
which
humans
co
exist
with
creatures
known
as
Pok
mon
a
large
variety
of
species
endowed
with
special
powers

The
franchise
s
primary
target
audience
is
children
aged
to
but
it
is
known
to
attract
people
of
all
ages

I
The
franchise
originated
as
a
pair
of
role
playing
games
developed
by
Game
Freak
from
an
original
concept
by
its
founder
Satoshi
Tajiri

Released
on
the
Game
Boy
on
February
the
games
became
sleeper
hits
and
were
followed
by
manga
series
a
trading
card
game
and
anime
series
and
films

From
to
Pok
mon
was
exported
to
the
rest
of
the
world
creating
an
unprecedented
global
phenomenon
dubbed
Pok
mania


By
the
craze
had
ended
after
which
Pok
mon
became
a
fixture
in
popular
culture
with
new
products
being
released
to
this
day

In
the
summer
of
the
franchise
spawned
a
second
craze
with
the
release
of
Pok
mon
Go
an
augmented
reality
game
developed
by
Niantic

Pok
mon
has
since
been
estimated
to
be
the
world
s
highest
grossing
media
franchise
and
one
of
the
best
selling
video
game
franchises

Pok
mon
has
an
uncommon
ownership
structure

Unlike
most
IPs
which
are
owned
by
one
company
Pok
mon
is
jointly
owned
by
three
Nintendo
Game
Freak
and
Creatures

Game
Freak
develops
the
core
series
role
playing
games
which
are
published
by
Nintendo
exclusively
for
their
consoles
while
Creatures
manages
the
trading
card
game
and
related
merchandise
occasionally
developing
spin
off
titles

The
three
companies
established
The
Pok
mon
Company
TPC
in
to
manage
the
Pok
mon
property
within
Asia

The
Pok
mon
anime
series
and
films
are
co
owned
by
Shogakukan

Since
The
Pok
mon
Company
International
TPCi
a
subsidiary
of
TPC
has
managed
the
franchise
in
all
regions
outside
of
Asia

Name
The
original
full
name
of
the
franchise
is
Pocket
Monsters
Poketto
Monsut
which
has
been
commonly
abbreviated
to
Pokemon
since
its
launch

When
the
franchise
was
released
internationally
the
short
form
of
the
title
was
used
with
an
acute
accent
over
the
e
to
aid
in
pronunciation

Pok
mon
refers
to
both
the
franchise
itself
and
the
creatures
within
its
fictional
universe

As
a
noun
it
is
identical
in
both
the
singular
and
plural
as
is
every
individual
species
name
it
is
grammatically
correct
to
say
one
Pok
mon
and
many
Pok
mon
as
well
as
one
Pikachu
and
many
Pikachu

Main

Gameplay
of
Pok
mon
The
Pok
mon
franchise
is
set
in
a
world
in
which
humans
coexist
with
creatures
known
as
Pok
mon

Pok
mon
Red
and
Blue
contain
Pok
mon
species
with
new
ones
being
added
in
subsequent
games
as
of
January
Pok
mon
species
have
been
introduced

c
Most
Pok
mon
are
inspired
by
real
world
animals
or
mythical
creatures
based
on
real
life
folklore

For
example
Pikachu
are
a
yellow
mouse
like
species
with
lightning
bolt
shaped
tails
that
possess
electrical
abilities

The
player
character
takes
the
role
of
a
Pok
mon
Trainer

The
Trainer
has
three
primary
goals
travel
and
explore
the
Pok
mon
world
discover
and
catch
each
Pok
mon
species
in
order
to
complete
their
Pok
dex
and
train
a
team
of
up
to
six
Pok
mon
at
a
time
and
have
them
engage
in
Pok
mon
battles

Most
Pok
mon
can
be
caught
with
spherical
devices
known
as
Pok
Balls

Once
the
opposing
Pok
mon
is
sufficiently
weakened
the
Trainer
throws
the
Pok
Ball
against
the
Pok
mon
which
is
then
transformed
into
a
form
of
energy
and
transported
into
the
device

Once
the
catch
is
successful
the
Pok
mon
is
tamed
and
is
under
the
Trainer
s
command
from
then
on

If
the
Pok
Ball
is
thrown
again
the
Pok
mon
re
materializes
into
its
original
state

The
Trainer
s
Pok
mon
can
engage
in
battles
against
opposing
Pok
mon
including
those
in
the
wild
or
owned
by
other
Trainers

Because
the
franchise
is
aimed
at
children
these
battles
are
never
presented
as
overtly
violent
and
contain
no
blood
or
gore

II
Pok
mon
never
die
in
battle
they
faint
upon
being
defeated
and
can
then
be
rejuvenated
at
a
Pok
mon
Center

III
When
a
Pok
mon
wins
a
battle
it
gains
experience
points

After
gaining
a
certain
amount
of
them
the
Pok
mon
levels
up
and
its
statistics
rise

As
its
level
increases
the
Pok
mon
learns
new
offensive
and
defensive
moves
to
use
in
battle

Furthermore
many
species
can
undergo
a
form
of
spontaneous
metamorphosis
called
Pok
mon
evolution
and
transform
into
stronger
forms

Most
Pok
mon
will
evolve
at
a
certain
level
while
others
evolve
through
different
means
such
as
exposure
to
a
certain
item
or
trading
with
another
trainer

History
Origins
The
main
idea
behind
Pok
mon
was
conceived
by
Satoshi
Tajiri

Tajiri
was
born
on
August
and
grew
up
in
Machida
a
suburb
of
Tokyo

As
a
child
he
enjoyed
discovering
and
catching
insects
and
other
small
creatures
in
the
various
ponds
and
fields
that
surrounded
his
town

During
Japan
s
economic
miracle
many
cities
including
Machida
were
significantly
expanded

As
a
consequence
Machida
s
nature
was
largely
destroyed

In
his
second
year
of
junior
high
school
an
arcade
hall
opened
in
Tajiri
s
neighborhood
introducing
him
to
video
games

While
studying
electrical
engineering
at
Tokyo
College
of
Technology
ja
Tajiri
began
publishing
a
doujinshi
magazine
titled
Game
Freak

The
title
was
inspired
by
the
film
Freaks
which
Tajiri
was
fascinated
with
at
the
time

He
self
published
the
first
issue
of
the
magazine
in
March
at
the
age
of


At
the
time
magazines
specializing
in
video
games
did
not
yet
exist
in
Japan
allowing
Game
Freak
to
fill
a
gap
in
the
market

Sometime
later
Tajiri
was
contacted
by
aspiring
manga
artist
Ken
Sugimori
who
became
Game
Freak
s
illustrator

Game
Freak
folded
in
the
late
s
by
which
point
Tajiri
had
become
a
respected
game
journalist
in
Japan
s
fledgling
video
game
industry

Tajiri
s
knowledge
of
video
games
brought
him
into
contact
with
Tsunekazu
Ishihara

Ishihara
had
studied
Arts
and
Science
at
Tsukuba
University
and
was
trained
in
CGI

After
working
in
advertising
for
two
years
Ishihara
joined
a
company
named
Sedic
in
which
created
video
graphics
and
software
including
one
video
game
Otocky


As
video
games
grew
in
popularity
Sedic
also
produced
a
number
of
game
related
television
shows
for
Fuji
Television
s
late
night
slot

In
his
job
as
a
TV
producer
Ishihara
befriended
Tajiri
as
well
as
Shigesato
Itoi
who
would
later
become
CEO
of
Ape
Inc

Ishihara
was
also
the
general
director
of
the
world
s
first
gaming
encyclopedia

Terebig

Kenji
Hatakeyama
Masakazu
Kubo
wrote
that
at
the
time
Ishihara
was
probably
the
most
well
connected
man
in
the
industry
with
a
knowledge
of
games
beyond
comparison


Ishihara
was
also
interested
in
playing
cards
and
contributed
to
the
development
of
at
least
three
simple
card
games
designed
by
Itoi
and
published
by
Ape

d
In
Tajiri
Sugimori
and
a
few
other
enthusiasts
started
an
informal
development
team
called
Game
Freak
named
after
the
magazine
it
grew
out
of

Over
the
next
few
years
they
independently
developed
the
puzzle
game
Quinty
working
on
it
alongside
school
or
their
regular
jobs

However
no
one
within
the
group
knew
how
to
make
the
game
s
music

After
consulting
all
his
contacts
Tajiri
got
in
touch
with
Junichi
Masuda
who
became
the
group
s
composer

Quinty
was
finished
in
and
published
by
Namco

Tajiri
officially
incorporated
Game
Freak
Co

Ltd

on
April

Two
original
Game
Boys
connected
with
a
Game
Link
Cable
Tajiri
started
to
think
of
what
was
to
become
Pok
mon
while
completing
Quinty
and
before
he
officially
founded
Game
Freak

Around
this
time
Nintendo
announced
the
upcoming
release
of
the
Game
Boy
a
handheld
console
that
would
revolutionize
the
gaming
industry

Tajiri
learned
that
the
device
would
have
a
link
port
and
with
the
corresponding
Game
Link
Cable
two
Game
Boys
could
be
linked
together

Sometime
later
Tajiri
remembered
an
incident
while
playing
Dragon
Quest
II
a
role
playing
game
RPG
for
the
Famicom
NES


The
game
features
randomly
appearing
items
of
varying
rarity
including
an
extremely
rare
item
called
Mysterious
Hat

e
Tajiri
did
not
encounter
any
while
Ken
Sugimori
who
was
also
playing
the
game
encountered
two

Upon
recalling
this
experience
Tajiri
realized
that
the
cable
now
made
it
possible
to
transfer
things
from
one
cartridge
to
another

IV
He
noted
that
until
then
the
Game
Link
Cable
was
only
used
for
competing
but
not
for
something
else

Combining
this
inspiration
with
his
memories
of
catching
insects
and
other
small
species
Tajiri
s
idea
would
eventually
evolve
into
a
virtual
recreation
of
his
boyhood
experiences
and
an
attempt
to
regain
the
world
that
he
had
lost


He
would
later
state
that
the
game
represents
the
story
of
a
boy
s
summer
day

Gachapon

Gashapon
capsules
have
been
cited
as
an
inspiration
for
Pokemon

Tajiri
and
his
Game
Freak
staff
began
pondering
over
a
game
centered
on
capturing
creatures
of
differing
rarity

Since
the
Game
Boy
is
a
portable
device
these
creatures
could
then
be
exchanged
with
other
players
in
real
life
using
the
link
cable

Once
the
player
has
caught
a
creature
in
game
it
was
to
be
stored
in
miniaturized
form
in
a
special
capsule

This
facet
of
the
game
was
inspired
by
Ultraseven
a
tokusatsu
show
that
Tajiri
had
enjoyed
as
a
child

The
series
titular
character
owns
a
number
of
capsules
containing
miniaturized
kaiju
monsters
which
come
out
and
return
to
their
original
sizes
when
the
capsule
is
thrown
into
mid
air

Kaiju
media
in
general
were
an
important
influence
on
Pokemon
as
many
Game
Freak
staff
members
had
grown
up
with
them

Other
influences
that
have
been
cited
by
Tajiri
include
gashapon
capsules
with
toy
figures
in
them
that
can
be
drawn
from
vending
machines
collectible
cards
such
as
baseball
cards
Ultraman
cards
and
menko
V
The
Final
Fantasy
Legend
the
first
RPG
for
the
Game
Boy
and
petting
in
Japan
with
Tajiri
noting
that
having
Pokemon
is
similar
to
having
pets

Tajiri
initially
named
his
project
Capsule
Monsters
which
GF
s
staff
commonly
shortened
to
Capumon

However
it
later
turned
out
that
the
term
Capsule
Monsters
could
not
be
trademarked
and
it
was
subsequently
decided
to
call
the
game
Pocket
Monsters
which
became
Pokemon

According
to
Tomisawa
the
phrase
Capsule
Monsters
was
already
registered

According
to
Hatakeyama
Kubo
the
word
capsule
could
not
be
used
in
the
trademark

Tomisawa
states
that
the
Game
Freak
staff
then
came
up
with
several
alternatives
before
someone
within
the
team
suggested
Pocket
Monsters


In
March
Nintendo
co
founded
Ape
Inc

with
Itoi

Ape
s
principal
work
was
Mother
a
role
playing
game
written
by
Itoi
but
it
was
also
founded
with
the
intent
to
give
outside
talent
a
chance
to
pitch
new
innovative
games

At
the
time
Ape
was
housed
in
the
same
Kanda
Sudach
office
building
as
Nintendo
located
in
Tokyo

Ishihara
a
friend
of
both
Itoi
and
Tajiri
was
involved
with
Ape
s
management
and
would
become
its
vice
president
in


Tajiri
s
relationship
with
Ishihara
prompted
Tajiri
to
present
his
idea
for
Pocket
Monsters
at
Ape
s
office

Present
during
Tajiri
s
pitch
was
Takashi
Kawaguchi
who
worked
at
Nintendo
s
General
Affairs
Department
and
was
also
a
manager
at
Ape

Kawaguchi
brought
the
idea
to
Nintendo
president
Hiroshi
Yamauchi
who
reportedly
said
This
is
it

This
is
the
idea
I
ve
been
waiting
for

By
pure
coincidence
Ishihara
had
come
up
with
an
idea
for
a
game
similar
to
that
of
Tajiri
and
around
the
same
time
was
discussing
it
with
Ape

This
game
Toto
involved
using
the
Game
Boy
as
an
insect
cage


Ishihara
emphasized
however
that
the
idea
of
trading
creatures
with
the
link
cable
was
Tajiri
s

GF
and
Ape
agreed
to
merge
their
projects
together

According
to
Tajiri
the
two
teams
initially
collaborated
on
the
game
but
the
work
proved
difficult
one
of
the
reasons
being
that
Ape
was
busy
developing
EarthBound

Tajiri
eventually
figured
that
rather
than
working
with
Ape
we
had
to
do
something
on
our
own
or
the
project
would
never
get
finished


Ape
Inc

is
not
credited
on
the
final
product

The
development
contract
was
signed
at
the
beginning
of
with
a
planned
delivery
of
the
game
in
October

Tajiri
directed
the
project
working
under
Ishihara

Ishihara
was
the
producer
he
managed
the
budget
staff
and
work
schedule
monitored
the
game
s
overall
progress
and
served
as
a
liaison
between
Game
Freak
and
Nintendo

Ishihara
also
contributed
ideas
to
the
development
and
helped
with
debugging

Sugimori
was
in
charge
of
the
graphics
and
character
design

Masuda
created
all
music
and
sound
effects
and
did
part
of
the
programming

The
budget
that
Nintendo
granted
to
Game
Freak
was
low
thus
Pocket
Monsters
was
initially
planned
as
a
small
compact
game
based
primarily
around
Tajiri
s
core
idea
of
exchanging

However
as
development
progressed
GF
s
ideas
and
ambitions
for
Pokemon
grew

They
soon
realized
that
the
game
they
were
beginning
to
envision
would
not
be
easy
to
make

Sugimori
admitted
that
at
the
time
no
one
at
GF
had
much
knowledge
of
RPGs

We
thought
we
could
handle
it
but
as
we
began
working
we
realized
it
was
going
to
be
tough
he
acknowledged

Pocket
Monsters
was
suspended
indefinitely
and
GF
turned
their
focus
on
other
titles
see
Game
Freak
Games


After
the
game
s
initial
development
phase
in
and
the
staff
tinkered
with
it
from
time
to
time
as
Sugimori
put
it

For
instance
by
October
a
large
number
of
Pokemon
had
been
designed
and
a
poll
was
held
that
month
among
all
staff
members
to
gauge
the
popularity
of
the
different
species

Several
more
such
votes
followed
to
determine
collectively
which
Pokemon
should
be
included

Still
development
had
mostly
come
to
a
halt
until
the
summer
of
after
the
release
of
the
platform
game
Pulseman
upon
which
Tajiri
decided
it
was
time
to
make
a
serious
effort
towards
finishing
Pocket
Monsters

By
this
point
Game
Freak
s
experience
had
grown
considerably

Over
the
years
a
number
of
new
staff
members
had
been
added
to
the
company

One
of
them
was
Atsuko
Nishida
a
graphic
artist
who
created
Pikachu
among
others

Ishihara
used
his
knowledge
of
card
games
to
add
more
depth
to
the
battle
system
and
among
other
things
suggested
Pokemon
types

Ishihara
also
came
up
with
the
idea
of
the
Pokedex
a
portable
encyclopedic
device
which
players
can
use
to
keep
track
of
the
Pokemon
they
caught

Throughout
the
years
Tajiri
had
several
conversations
with
Shigeru
Miyamoto
Nintendo
s
top
game
designer
who
Tajiri
described
as
a
mentor
figure

Although
in
a
retrospect
Miyamoto
downplayed
his
role
in
advising
Tajiri
and
stated
that
his
contributions
to
Pokemon
were
in
fact
limited

Miyamoto
did
however
suggest
the
use
of
different
colored
cartridges
for
the
game
in
response
to
Tajiri
s
and
Ishihara
s
musings
about
making
each
playthrough
slightly
different
as
to
individualize
the
player
s
experience

According
to
Tajiri
five
or
seven
colors
were
considered
but
they
eventually
settled
on
two
Red
and
Green

Otherwise
identical
each
had
Pokemon
not
found
in
the
other
encouraging
players
to
socialize
and
trade
to
complete
their
collection

Ishihara
aspired
to
create
video
games
of
his
own

As
Pocket
Monsters
Red
and
Green
were
nearing
completion
Ishihara
founded
Creatures
Inc

on
November


Upon
founding
the
company
was
housed
in
the
same
office
building
as
Nintendo
in
Tokyo

Co
ownership
of
the
Pokemon
property
which
Ishihara
helped
create
was
subsequently
assigned
to
Creatures

This
resulted
in
Pokemon
having
three
legal
owners
Game
Freak
the
main
developer
Creatures
representing
producer
Ishihara
and
Nintendo
the
publisher

Anne
Allison
wrote
that
Nintendo
also
bought
the
property
after
Red
and
Green
were
finished

Hatakeyama
Kubo
noted
that
the
ownership
structure
of
Pokemon
is
uncommon

They
wrote
that
Pokemon
is
probably
the
only
property
in
the
world
today
for
which
the
original
rights
are
not
concentrated
in
a
single
company
like
The
Walt
Disney
Company
does
with
their
IPs

Tajiri
and
Ishihara
did
consider
merging
Game
Freak
and
Creatures
at
one
point

However
Tajiri
decided
against
it
because
he
feared
it
would
erase
what
he
had
built
up
since
he
was
a
teenager

I
felt
threatened
by
the
idea
of
changing
how
Game
Freak
was
operating
and
starting
back
over
with
Mr

Ishihara
he
said

It
was
an
identity
problem

If
Game
Freak
ceased
to
exist
then
so
would
I


Tajiri
noted
that
since
Game
Freak
and
Creatures
both
focus
on
Pokemon
it
sometimes
felt
more
like
different
departments
than
different
companies

Pocket
Monsters
Red
and
Green
were
finally
finished
in
December


A
release
date
of
December
that
year
was
announced
but
missed

After
sufficient
cartridges
manuals
and
packages
had
been
manufactured
the
pair
of
games
ended
up
being
published
on
February


However
the
property
was
copyrighted
in
and
is
shown
on
the
title
screens
and
cartridges

This
year
is
since
used
on
the
copyright
notice
seen
on
many
Pokemon
products
even
though
no
actual
Pokemon
product
was
released
in


Rise
in
Japan
Release
of
Red
Green
Nintendo
had
no
high
expectations
of
Pocket
Monsters
Red
and
Green
and
media
largely
ignored
the
game
s


By
the
seven
year
old
Game
Boy
console
was
considered
yesterday
s
news
and
near
the
end
of
its
lifecycle

On
the
other
hand
new
Game
Boys
continued
to
be
manufactured
and
sold

The
console
was
widespread
and
due
to
its
age
affordable
to
children

Also
the
Game
Boy
had
experienced
a
small
revival
in
Japan
in
due
to
the
success
of
Mario
s
Picross

Coincidentally
this
game
was
directed
by
Ishihara
and
co
developed
by
Ape

The
popularity
of
Mario
s
Picross
incited
Nintendo
to
develop
the
Game
Boy
Pocket
a
slimmer
and
improved
version
of
the
Game
Boy
released
in
Japan
on
July


Because
of
the
timing
and
naming
some
were
under
the
impression
that
the
Game
Boy
Pocket
was
made
to
promote
Pocket
Monsters
but
this
was
in
fact
a
coincidence
that
would
end
up
benefiting
both

CoroCoro
manga
Mew
lottery
Two
media
channels
that
would
play
important
roles
in
the
Pokemon
franchise
were
the
CoroCoro
Comic
released
monthly
and
its
sister
magazine
Bessatsu
CoroCoro
Comic
released
bi
monthly

Both
manga
magazines
are
published
by
Shogakukan
a
long
time
business
partner
of
Nintendo
and
have
featured
manga
based
on
Nintendo
properties
e
g

Super
Mario
kun
Kirby
of
the
Stars
Donkey
Kong


At
the
time
of
Pokemon
s
release
the
main
CoroCoro
magazine
was
read
by
one
in
four
elementary
school
students

CoroCoro
s
deputy
editor
in
chief
was
Masakazu
Kubo
ja


On
Ishihara
s
suggestion
Kubo
commissioned
the
creation
of
a
manga
adaptation

Written
and
illustrated
by
Kosaku
Anakubo
ja
its
first
chapter
was
featured
in
the
March
April
issue
of
Bessatsu
CoroCoro
Comic
released
on
February
the
day
after
Red
and
Green
s
release

Shogakukan
which
frequently
surveys
their
target
groups
determined
that
the
Pocket
Monsters
manga
was
well
received

To
further
promote
Red
and
Green
the
May
issue
of
CoroCoro
released
on
April
announced
the
Legendary
Pokemon
Offer
centered
around
a
mysterious
secret
Pokemon
called
Mew

Mew
was
a
last
minute
addition
to
Red
Green

It
is
unobtainable
in
the
game
s
through
usual
means
and
was
intended
to
be
used
at
a
later
point
in
some
post
launch
activity

To
participate
in
the
promotion
CoroCoro
readers
had
to
send
in
a
postcard
and
from
the
entrants
were
selected
at
random

The
winners
then
had
to
send
in
their
cartridge
so
that
Mew
could
be
uploaded
onto
it

The
lottery
was
a
success
and
increased
word
of
mouth

By
September
sales
of
Red
and
Green
had
surpassed
million
units

Blue
Version
After
the
release
of
Pokemon
Red
and
Green
Game
Freak
continued
to
grow
and
a
number
of
new
employees
were
hired

For
training
purposes
they
were
ordered
to
study
and
make
bug
fixes
to
the
source
code
of
Red
Green
and
to
create
new
sprites
for
it
the
test
was
later
dubbed
Pocket
Monsters
Blue

It
was
originally
not
meant
to
be
sold

Only
a
small
number
of
handmade
copies
were
made
intended
as
a
special
gift
to
to
people


After
Kubo
learned
of
it
he
encouraged
Tajiri
and
Ishihara
to
allow
an
official
release
of
Blue

President
Hiroshi
Yamauchi
initially
rejected
this
fearing
it
would
confuse
people
into
believing
it
was
an
entirely
new
Pokemon
game

Kawaguchi
then
suggested
an
alternative
which
Yamauchi
agreed
with
Blue
would
not
receive
a
normal
retail
release
but
would
instead
be
made
available
only
through
mail
order
for
a
limited
time
as
a
special
offer

It
was
announced
in
the
November
issue
of
CoroCoro
which
explicitly
stated
that
Blue
was
not
a
new
game
but
rather
a
special
limited
edition
to
celebrate
million
sales
of
Red
and
Green

The
offer
was
a
surprisingly
big
success
units
were
expected
to
be
sold
but
over
double
was
ordered

Trading
Card
Game
The
Pokemon
Trading
Card
Game
was
one
of
the
first
collectible
card
games
CCGs
developed
in
Japan

Its
creation
was
influenced
by
Magic
The
Gathering
the
first
CCG
in
history

Indeed
the
Pokemon
Trading
Card
Game
can
be
considered
a
simplified
version
of
Magic

First
released
in
the
United
States
in
Magic
had
gained
popularity
not
just
in
North
America
and
Europe
but
also
in
Asia

Ishihara
was
fond
of
playing
cards
and
had
contributed
to
the
development
of
at
least
three
simple
card
games
designed
by
Shigesato
Itoi
and
released
through
Ape
Inc

d
At
the
time
Ishihara
was
particularly
interested
in
Magic
The
Gathering

While
developing
the
Pokemon
RPG
he
realized
that
the
concept
behind
it
could
be
adapted
into
a
Magic
like
CCG

The
Pokemon
Trading
Card
Game
was
designed
by
Ishihara
Akihiko
Miura
K
ichi
yama
and
Takumi
Akabane

All
were
former
staff
members
of
Ape
and
had
previously
worked
on
EarthBound
Miura
was
the
game
s
main
designer
yama
was
its
art
director
and
Akabane
was
one
of
its
chief
debuggers

While
card
games
have
a
long
history
in
Japan
a
collectible
card
game
was
a
relatively
new
concept
there
and
at
the
time
not
widely
known

Because
of
this
Ishihara
had
difficulties
finding
distributors

Sometime
in
Ishihara
pitched
the
card
game
to
Nintendo

They
agreed
to
have
the
cards
manufactured
subcontracting
an
unidentified
printing
company

However
Nintendo
did
not
want
the
hassle
of
having
to
develop
a
distribution
system
from
the
ground
up
i
e

finding
retailers
willing
to
sell
a
CCG

Ishihara
was
then
contacted
by
Satoshi
Kayama
director
of
a
small
firm
called
Media
Factory

Like
Ishihara
Kayama
was
a
fan
of
card
games

He
felt
that
CCGs
would
soon
rise
to
prominence
in
Japan
and
had
been
gathering
information
on
the
possibility
of
developing
such
a
game
in
some
form

When
Kayama
heard
that
Creatures
had
developed
a
CCG
he
contacted
Ishihara
and
offered
to
distribute
it
signing
the
contract
near
the
end
of


CoroCoro
again
proved
a
valuable
information
channel

The
Trading
Card
Game
was
first
announced
in
the
November
issue
the
same
one
that
announced
Pokemon
Blue

The
issue
came
bundled
with
two
promo
cards
one
of
Purin
Jigglypuff
and
one
of
Pikachu

Surveys
showed
that
they
were
respectively
the
most
and
second
most
popular
Pokemon
at
the
time

On
October
the
first
card
set
was
released

Booster
packs
were
launched
the
same
day
containing
randomly
inserted
cards

In
the
West
the
booster
packs
contained
cards

f
The
original
set
would
be
titled
the
Base
Set
in
English

Many
more
sets
would
follow

Despite
being
ignored
by
the
media
except
for
the
CoroCoro
the
cards
became
an
instant
success
upon
release

million
Pokemon
cards
were
shipped
by
the
end
of
March
six
months
after
its
launch
and
one
month
before
the
debut
of
the
next
big
installment
of
the
franchise
the
Pokemon
anime

The
success
of
the
TV
series
would
cause
the
cards
sales
figure
to
explode
by
March
a
total
of
million
cards
had
been
produced
in
Japan

Anime
production
launches
By
August
Kubo
had
become
convinced
of
Pokemon
s
potential
and
believed
Shogakukan
should
create
an
anime
adaptation

Nintendo
was
hesitant
noting
that
if
the
anime
would
flop
it
would
negatively
affect
the
popularity
of
the
game

Ishihara
initially
opposed
the
idea
because
he
thought
it
would
overly
hasten
the
consumption
of
the
property
he
feared
that
if
the
series
would
end
people
would
assume
that
Pokemon
has
ended
and
move
on
to
the
next
thing

At
the
time
Creatures
and
Game
Freak
were
planning
the
sequel
s
to
Red
and
Green
Pokemon
Gold
and
Silver
and
Ishihara
did
not
want
the
anime
to
end
before
they
could
release
their
new
games

Kubo
was
ultimately
able
to
resolve
the
concerns
of
all
parties
involved

An
important
aspect
of
Kubo
s
bargaining
power
was
the
then
ongoing
Mini
WD
craze
and
its
accompanying
hit
series
Bakus
Ky
dai
Let
s
Go


Kubo
had
an
important
role
in
the
creation
of
both
which
impressed
the
stakeholders

To
appease
Ishihara
Kubo
promised
him
that
the
anime
would
last
for
at
least
a
year
and
a
half

This
was
unusually
long
for
a
debuting
anime
and
required
a
big
investment

Kubo
s
proposal
for
Pocket
Monsters
was
officially
approved
on
September


For
Nintendo
of
Japan
it
was
the
first
time
they
licensed
a
TV
series

Kubo
assigned
independent
producer
Choji
Yoshikawa
ja
to
lead
the
project

Shogakukan
Productions
commonly
called
ShoPro
was
Shogakukan
s
production
company

The
animation
company
they
commissioned
was
OLM
Inc

Oriental
Light
and
Magic
on
Kubo
s
suggestion

Kunihiko
Yuyama
one
of
OLM
s
founding
members
became
the
anime
s
director

ShoPro
assembled
a
team
of
five
writers
plus
two
supporting
writers

All
key
people
involved
with
the
production
of
Pokemon
were
well
experienced
and
had
proven
track
records
within
Japan
s
anime
industry

Yoshikawa
felt
that
the
team
got
lucky

The
probability
of
so
many
great
people
coming
together
at
the
same
time
is
very
low
he
said

Per
Tajiri
s
explicit
condition
every
anime
team
member
had
to
play
the
game
extensively
including
the
illustrators
and
voice
actors

The
anime
staff
unanimously
agreed
that
the
game
was
interesting
and
felt
connected
with
each
other
through
the
world
of
Pokemon
feeling
positively
challenged
to
make
an
anime
that
would
match
the
game
s
quality

A

hugging
a
Pikachu
costumed
performer

Pikachu
became
a
popular
character
among
both
boys
and
girls

A
production
council
was
formed
to
produce
the
anime

Different
people
appeared
at
different
meetings
but
four
individuals
usually
present
were
Ishihara
of
Creatures
Sugimori
of
Game
Freak
Yuyama
of
OLM
and
independent
producer
Yoshikawa

Yoshikawa
had
the
final
say

The
council
decided
on
the
anime
s
worldview
characters
general
storyline
and
various
important
details

The
early
meetings
which
were
also
attended
by
Tajiri
usually
started
with
a
Q
A
session
in
which
Tajiri
and
Ishihara
were
asked
about
the
Pokemon
universe

The
council
was
careful
to
have
the
anime
be
in
concordance
with
the
video
game

Inevitably
there
had
to
be
differences
between
the
two
but
all
agreed
that
the
overall
worldview
as
envisioned
by
Tajiri
should
not
be
disturbed

At
the
start
of
the
video
game
the
player
has
to
choose
one
of
three
starter
Pokemon
Fushigidane
Hitokage
or
Zenigame
Bulbasaur
Charmander
or
Squirtle


The
council
didn
t
want
to
unfairly
popularize
any
of
them
and
wanted
the
protagonist
to
start
out
with
a
different
Pokemon

Hatakeyama
Kubo
wrote
that
by
coincidence
three
people
independently
suggested
to
the
council
that
a
Pikachu
should
be
a
main
character
in
the
anime
Kubo
Yuyama
and
Keisuke
Iwata
of
TV
Tokyo
s
Film
Department

In
the
end
all
council
members
agreed
that
Pikachu
should
be
one
of
Pocket
Monsters
central
icons
as
they
expected
Pikachu
to
appeal
to
both
boys
and
girls
as
well
as
their
mothers

This
would
expand
its
audience
which
was
considered
a
core
objective
of
the
anime

During
the
council
s
first
meeting
Yoshikawa
brought
up
the
issue
on
whether
the
Pokemon
in
the
anime
could
talk
and
if
not
how
they
could
communicate

In
the
video
games
each
has
a
specific
cry

In
Anakubo
s
CoroCoro
manga
most
could
speak

At
first
the
council
believed
there
should
be
a
mixture
of
Pokemon
that
could
talk
and
some
that
could
not

However
this
idea
was
eventually
discarded
the
Pokemon
had
to
make
a
specific
cry

The
council
agreed
that
Pokemon
were
like
animals
and
while
they
and
humans
should
be
able
to
understand
each
other
in
the
series
they
should
not
speak
each
other
s
language

It
was
decided
that
Pikachu
would
repeatedly
say
its
own
name
in
various
intonations

The
role
of
Pikachu
was
given
to
Ikue
Otani

During
try
outs
Yuyama
had
Otani
voice
Pikachu
in
normal
Japanese
as
well
as
in
Pikachu
talk
in
which
it
only
said
the
syllables
of
its
name

Yuyama
realized
that
even
in
the
latter
style
of
limited
communication
Otani
was
experienced
enough
to
still
convey
the
messages
and
emotions
needed

ShoPro
paid
half
of
the
production
cost
of
Pokemon

TV
Tokyo
paid
the
other
half
and
was
granted
co
ownership
of
the
anime

The
ads
during
the
show
s
commercial
breaks
were
managed
by
advertisement
agency
JR
Kikaku
ja
which
was
in
turn
paid
by
sponsors
buying
advertisement
space

In
negotiating
with
TV
Tokyo
Kubo
managed
to
secure
the
timeslot
on
Tuesdays

Pocket
Monsters
premiered
on
April


By
November
it
had
become
the
highest
rated
program
on
TV
Tokyo

The
anime
succeeded
in
its
goal
of
widening
Pokemon
s
audience

Although
the
video
games
and
the
cards
remained
mostly
of
interest
to
boys
the
anime
also
got
more
girls
interested
in
the
franchise
and
girls
purchases
of
Pokemon
products
increased

This
has
been
partly
credited
to
Pikachu
who
gained
widespread
popularity
among
both
boys
and
girls

The
success
of
this
character
would
later
lead
to
the
game
Pocket
Monsters
Pikachu

Yellow
Special
Pikachu
Edition
released
in
Japan
on
September


An
adaptation
of
Pokemon

this
version
was
made
to
resemble
the

series

Copyright
council
formed
merchandising
expands
In
the
early
months
of
the
franchise
Nintendo
was
the
contractual
representative
for
Pokemon
and
thus
the
central
contact
point
for
all
Pokemon
related
licensing
the
approval
of
branded
products


Around
the
time
that
planning
of
the
anime
begun
licensing
requests
for
Pokemon
started
to
increase
which
Nintendo
had
difficulties
handling
due
to
a
lack
of
experienced
staff

Nintendo
consequently
granted
ShoPro
exclusive
licensor
rights

This
was
the
first
time
that
Nintendo
of
Japan
NoJ
granted
licensor
rights
to
another
company
aside
from
its
overseas
subsidiaries
Nintendo
of
America
NoA
and
Nintendo
of
Europe
NoE


A
copyright
council
was
formed
headed
by
Ishihara

Beginning
in
April
the
council
met
every
Tuesday
in
the
conference
room
of
Creatures
office
at
the
Nintendo
Kanda
Building
in
Sudach
Tokyo

Attendees
usually
included
Ishihara
and
his
secretary
representatives
of
Nintendo
Game
Freak
ShoPro
TV
Tokyo
and
JR
Kikaku
as
well
as
head
of
the
anime
Yoshikawa

Broadly
put
every
meeting
had
three
types
of
agenda
items
discussing
Pokemon
related
events
and
basic
policies
in
Japan
discussing
Shogakukan
publication
plans
and
considering
merchandise
proposals

For
merchandising
the
council
set
the
bar
high

Fiercely
protective
of
Pokemon
s
brand
equity
Ishihara
was
unwilling
to
greenlit
an
item
just
because
it
had
a
picture
of
a
Pokemon
printed
on
it

To
avoid
the
market
being
flooded
with
low
quality
goods
Ishihara
put
very
specific
demands
on
the
products
he
evaluated

Furthermore
in
most
cases
the
council
opted
to
contract
one
company
for
each
product
category

Because
of
this
most
merchandise
proposals
were
rejected
of
the
approximately
applications
submitted
in
only
about
was
approved

By
March
companies
offered
licensed
Pokemon
goods
and
there
were
approximately
Pokemon
products

Tomy
manufactured
Pokemon
toy
figures
and
plush
dolls

Bandai
made
Pokemon
gashapon
dolls
and
ramune
flavored
candy
in
a
plastic
box
in
the
shape
of
a
Game
Boy

Meiji
Seika
produced
Pokemon
chocolate
snacks
and
pudding

The
lucrative
franchise
provided
a
much
needed
boost
to
Japan
s
economy
which
was
stagnating
in
what
would
later
be
called
the
Lost
Decade

An
example
of
a
firm
that
benefited
greatly
from
Pokemon
was
food
manufacturer
Nagatanien
jp


From
May
the
company
began
selling
Pokemon
branded
curry
furikake
and
baking
mixes

In
December
Nagatanien
was
hit
hard
by
the
collapse
of
one
of
its
biggest
sales
channels
Toshoku
in
what
was
then
the
third
largest
bankruptcy
in
Japan
s
postwar
history

Nonetheless
due
to
their
Pokemon
licensed
products
Nagatanien
reported
net
profits
in
fiscal
years
and
despite
having
forecasted
losses

Denn
Senshi
Porygon
incident
See

Pok
mon
episodes
removed
from
rotation
In
the
evening
of
December
the
Pokemon
franchise
was
hit
by
a
crisis
related
to
the
broadcast
of
the
anime
s
th
episode
Denn
Senshi
Porygon
Computer
Warrior
Porygon


It
was
watched
by
approximately


million
households

In
the
episode
the
cast
is
transported
into
a
virtual
world
accompanied
by
a
Porygon
a
digital
human
made
Pokemon

While
flying
through
cyberspace
they
are
attacked
by
an
anti
virus
program
which
mistakes
them
for
viruses
shooting
vaccine
missiles
at
the
group
resulting
in
explosions
of
bright
rapidly
swapping
red
and
blue
flashes

The
intense
stimuli
brought
about
by
the
episode
triggered
a
variety
of
adverse
health
effects
in
more
than
viewers
primarily
irritated
eyes
headaches
dizziness
and
nausea

A
small
part
suffered
a
photosensitive
epileptic
seizure
manifested
in
loss
of
conscious
and
or
convulsions

Hundreds
g
of
children
were
brought
to
hospitals
although
a
part
of
them
had
recovered
enough
upon
arrival
and
did
not
need
to
be
hospitalized

No
one
died

Broadcasting
of
Pokemon
was
halted
and
new
guidelines
were
implemented
to
help
prevent
similar
events
from
happening

With
the
show
on
hiatus
ShoPro
and
OLM
worked
on
a
feature
Pokemon
film

By
the
time
the
incident
occurred
its
script
was
already
written
and
the
movie
was
in
the
storyboard
stage

In
mid
January
the
staff
resumed
creating
new
episodes

The
anime
series
returned
on
April


The
film
titled
Pocket
Monsters
the
Movie
Mewtwo
Strikes
Back
Pok
mon
The
First
Movie
premiered
on
July
and
became
the
fourth
highest
grossing
film
of
the
year
in
Japan

Ultimately
the
incident
did
not
damage
the
Pokemon
franchise
it
in
fact
grew
further
during
and
after
the
anime
s
hiatus

While
video
rental
tapes
were
removed
from
shelves
all
other
Pokemon
products
continued
to
be
sold
as
usual
and
customer
demand
for
them
remained
high

Helping
matters
was
a
general
understanding
among
businesses
that
the
anime
was
not
canceled
but
rather
suspended
and
many
executives
correctly
expected
the
show
to
be
resumed
after
precautions
had
been
taken

Supermarkets
and
other
distribution
outlets
responded
calmly
to
the
crisis
and
did
not
remove
Pokemon
products
from
their
sales
floors

International
expansion
North
America
When
we
started
this
project
in
Japan
one
of
the
first
things
I
was
told
was
that
this
kind
of
thing
would
never
appeal
to
American
audiences

They
said
Because
the
characters
are
in
a
very
Japanese
style
you
cannot
sell
them
to
Americans


So
from
the
very
beginning
I
never
thought
there
would
be
an
English
version

Now
it
s
just
as
popular
in
the
United
States
as
in
Japan
and
I
realized
that
we
shouldn
t
always
believe
the
opinions
of
conservative
marketers

Shigeru
Miyamoto
August
Possibly
the
first
person
to
show
interest
in
a
North
American
launch
of
Pokemon
was
Minoru
Arakawa
founder
and
then
president
of
Nintendo
of
America
NoA


Arakawa
visited
Japan
to
participate
in
Shoshinkai
held
November


It
was
around
this
time
when
he
first
played
one
of
the
three
Pokemon
titles

He
thought
the
games
were
promising
but
Nintendo
of
Japan
NoJ
had
no
plans
at
the
time
to
release
them
elsewhere

He
returned
to
America
with
a
few
cartridges
and
tested
the
game
on
his
employees
they
did
not
believe
it
would
work
in
the
US

At
the
time
role
playing
games
RPGs
were
not
very
popular
outside
Japan
and
NoA
executives
believed
that
American
children
did
not
have
the
attention
span
for
such
a
complex
title

Americans
were
said
to
be
more
interested
in
sport
and
action
oriented
games
preferably
with
realistic
graphics

Japanese
people
by
contrast
were
alleged
to
care
more
about
characters
and
plot

Up
to
that
point
few
Japanese
properties
had
been
successfully
mainstreamed
in
the
US
and
if
they
were
it
was
alleged
to
be
on
account
of
having
been
properly
Americanized
Mighty
Morphin
Power
Rangers
was
considered
a
prime
example
of
this

Visually
Pokemon
was
believed
to
be
too
kawaii
or
cute

It
was
assumed
that
Pokemon
could
not
succeed
on
cute
alone
it
must
also
be
cool

In
an
effort
to
enhance
the
franchise
s
coolness
NoA
considered
a
graphical
redesign
and
contracted
a
few
external
artists
to
create
some
test
designs
for
the
American
market

The
mockups
they
proposed
included
graffiti
style
drawings
beefed
up
and
more
muscular
looking
Pokemon
and
a
new
Pikachu
that
looked
like
a
tiger
with
huge
breasts


Arakawa
concluded
that
it
didn
t
work
and
by
that
time
the
anime
had
begun
its
production
in
Japan
leading
NoA
to
conclude
it
was
too
late
for
a
graphical
revamp
anyway

Of
pivotal
importance
to
Pokemon
s
global
expansion
was
Alfred
R

Kahn
CEO
of
US
based
Kids
Entertainment
NoA
s
licensing
agent
since


Convinced
of
the
franchise
s
potential
Kahn
agreed
to
invest
an
undisclosed
sum
in
return
for
both
the
anime
and
licensing
rights

Pokemon
became
one
of
the
first
Japanese
media
franchises
in
which
both
the
localization
of
the
anime
and
the
licensing
of
merchandise
was
handled
by
a
single
company
as
well
as
a
non
Japanese
company

Kahn
suggested
to
use
the
short
version
of
the
name
Pok
mon
adding
an
acute
accent
over
the
e
to
assist
with
pronunciation
and
give
it
a
little
flair


NoJ
president
Hiroshi
Yamauchi
officially
approved
the
project
in
late
November
and
subsequently
announced
it
at
Space
World


However
three
weeks
later
the
Denn
Senshi
Porygon
incident
happened
which
Kubo
felt
made
even
more
people
resistant
to
the
idea
of
an
overseas
introduction

Market
research
turned
back
negative
American
kids
reportedly
did
not
like
Pok
mon

Arakawa
ignored
the
study
and
convinced
of
the
franchise
s
potential
allocated
an
enormous
budget
to
Pok
mon
s
launch

The
exact
amount
was
not
disclosed
but
was
reportedly
equal
to
or
more
than
million
c



million
in
approximately
the
same
amount
as
the
launch
budget
of
the
Nintendo
Entertainment
System
in


Arakawa
admitted
that
it
was
quite
a
bit
of
money
but
NoA
had
been
doing
well
for
several
years
so
we
had
a
lot
of
money
to
spare


He
opined
that
if
Pok
mon
would
be
as
successful
in
the
US
as
it
had
been
in
Japan
an
investment
of
would
turn
into


NoA
and
Kids
proceeded
to
devise
a
strategy
on
how
to
localize
Pok
mon
for
the
United
States

Arakawa
appointed
Gail
Tilden
to
lead
the
project
prompting
her
to
leave
her
position
at
Nintendo
Power
magazine

Tilden
said
that
they
decided
to
make
an
all
out
effort
to
repeat
the
phenomenon
in
the
Western
world


In
two
press
releases
NoA
self
described
Pok
mon
s
marketing
campaign
as
aggressive


The
localization
of
the
Pok
mon
anime
was
done
by
Kids
and
directed
by
Norman
J

Grossfeld

Grossfeld
strongly
believed
that
the
anime
should
be
Americanized

At
NATPE
he
asked
ShoPro
for
a
kind
of
carte
blanche
to
let
me
change
the
show
as
I
think
would
work
for
this
market
to
which
ShoPro
agreed

However
no
national
TV
station
was
interested
in
buying
the
anime
or
financing
its
localization

Kahn
then
decided
to
self
finance
Pok
mon
s
production
costs
despite
realizing
this
could
very
well
bring
down
Kids
if
the
show
would
fail

According
to
Kahn
they
spend
a
fortune
on
the
localization

To
have
it
broadcast
in
syndication
Kids
offered
the
show
for
free
to
local
TV
stations
across
the
country
in
exchange
for
a
portion
of
the
advertising
revenue

NoA
assisted
persuading
dozens
of
stations
to
carry
the
series
by
offering
to
buy
some
of
their
advertisement
space
spending
a
total
of
million
c



million
in


Despite
all
this
most
broadcasters
were
still
reluctant
to
carry
Pok
mon
with
Grossfeld
experiencing
difficulties
getting
through
their
preconceived
notions
or
their
snobbery
for
Western
produced
animation
over
something
from
Asia


At
the
time
anime
had
not
yet
found
mainstream
popularity
in
the
West

Contemporary
news
reports
cited
Sailor
Moon
VI
as
an
example
of
an
anime
that
had
failed
to
catch
on
with
American
youth

h
Still
with
NoA
s
help
Kids
ultimately
succeeded
in
contracting
broadcasters
for
Pok
mon
reaching
about
to
percent
of
television
households

However
many
broadcasters
gave
it
off
peak
time
slots
with
starting
times
like
or


Prior
to
the
late
s
this
was
the
case
for
many
anime
in
the
US

Grossfeld
came
up
with
the
advertising
slogan
Gotta
catch
em
all
as
the
English
equivalent
to
the
Japanese
Pokemon
GETTO
daze
Get
the
Pok
mon


The
phrase
miraculously
managed
to
gain
approval
by
the
Federal
Communications
Commission
FCC
which
normally
prohibits
the
use
of
injunctions
in
ads
directed
at
children
e
g

You
must
buy
this


While
the
tagline
does
sound
commanding
the
FCC
reasoned
that
the
act
of
catching
is
at
the
core
of
Pok
mon
s
play

Therefore
the
phrase
was
allowed

The
series
theme
song
was
written
by
John
Loeffler
and
John
Siegler
and
performed
by
Jason
Paige

In
commissioning
the
track
Grossfeld
specifically
requested
the
song
s
chorus
to
be
written
around
the
Gotta
catch
em
all
phrase
firmly
embedding
the
slogan
into
the
theme

While
NoA
and
Kids
were
allowed
a
fair
degree
of
liberty
in
their
localization
of
Pok
mon
the
Japanese
copyright
council
headed
by
Ishihara
had
the
last
say
over
it

All
decisions
regarding
adjustments
and
promotion
had
to
gain
final
approval
of
the
Japan
side

This
included
all
of
the
merchandise
for
which
a
two
step
system
was
created

All
aspiring
licensees
in
North
America
were
to
send
their
merchandise
proposals
to
Kids

Staff
of
both
Kids
and
NoA
then
made
a
pre
selection
and
send
the
approved
proposals
to
Japan
where
the
council
made
the
final
decision

Many
submissions
were
bounced
at
the
US
stage
and
thus
never
got
sent
to
Japan

Tilden
noted
that
processing
all
license
applications
and
mailing
all
approved
prototypes
and
their
documentation
to
Japan
was
a
lot
of
work

Arakawa
did
consider
streamlining
the
process
by
moving
someone
from
Japan
to
the
US
but
no
person
could
be
found
who
was
as
competent
as
Ishihara

The
Pok
mon
anime
was
first
broadcast
on
September


Pok
mon
Red
Version
and
Blue
Version
were
released
three
weeks
later
on
September


To
localize
the
card
game
Nintendo
contracted
Wizards
of
the
Coast
the
creator
of
Magic
The
Gathering

The
Pok
mon
Trading
Card
Game
was
officially
launched
nationwide
on
January
although
pre
sold
in
select
stores
in
December

Coinciding
with
the
North
American
launch
of
Pok
mon
was
the
release
of
the
Game
Boy
Color
on
November


Other
regions
The
American
version
of
the
Pok
mon
anime
started
broadcasting
in
Australia
and
New
Zealand
on
September


Red
and
Blue
were
subsequently
released
there
on
October


Various
territories
in
Asia
followed
the
anime
series
debuted
in
Hong
Kong
on
November
in
Taiwan
on
November
in
Shanghai
on
November
in
Beijing
on
January
and
in
South
Korea
on
July


Outside
North
America
Kids
distributed
the
anime
in
cooperation
with
Brian
Lacey
of
Lacey
Entertainment

The
series
was
presented
at
MIP
TV
in
Cannes
France
from
April


Broadcasters
were
initially
not
interested
due
to
its
Japanese
origins
and
preferred
to
wait
and
see
how
the
anime
would
fare
in
the
US

After
its
American
success
Lacey
received
inquiries
about
the
series
throughout
from
multiple
international
broadcasters

Lacey
noted
that
in
Europe
this
was
a
stark
contrast
compared
to
previous
years
I
was
trying
to
sell
this
sort
of
stuff
for
years
and
buyers
would
tell
me
they
were
moving
away
from
Japanese
animation
shows
he
said

In
October
the
franchise
was
launched
in
the
European
key
markets
of
Germany
the
United
Kingdom
France
and
Spain

The
anime
started
broadcasting
in
Denmark
Norway
and
Sweden
in
December


In
broadcasting
rights
for
the
first
season
were
secured
by
TV
stations
in
South
Africa
Russia
Iceland
and
Finland

In
Israel
the

debuted
in

For
unclear
reasons
Red

Blue
were
not
officially
released
there

Thriving
only
on
the
strength
of
the
TV
series
The
First
Movie
the
cards
and
imported
video
games
the
Israeli
Pok
mon
still
became
a
success

By
the
end
of
Pok

games
had
been
released
in
countries
the

Pok
mania
In
North
America
the
debuting
Pok
mon
franchise
quickly
rose
to
success

Red
and
Blue
sold
copies
in
its
first
month

By
December
the
Pok
mon
anime
had
become
the
highest
rated
syndicated
children
s
show
during
the
weekdays

This
attracted
the
attention
of
two
media
companies
Warner
Bros

co
owner
of
The
WB
channel
and
Saban
Entertainment
Fox
Family
Worldwide
owners
of
the
Fox
Kids
channel

A
bidding
war
ensued
between
the
parties
which
was
won
by
Warner
Bros

On
February
Pok
mon
launched
on
the
Kids
WB
national
television
block

The
debut
episode
became
the
most
watched
premiere
in
Kids
WB
s
history

In
European
countries
the
anime
received
similar
levels
of
success

For
example
in
Germany
a
highly
competitive
kids
market
Pok
mon
was
purchased
by
RTL


The
show
s
popularity
bolstered
the
entire
program
block
more
than
tripling
its
viewers

Andrea
Lang
RTL
s
editor
of
cartoons
and
children
s
programs
said
We
were
speechless

We
ve
never
had
a
comparable
success


By
March
half
a
year
before
Pok
mon
s
overseas
launch
million
Pok
mon
cards
had
been
produced

By
March
the
total
number
of
cards
shipped
reached
million

By
March
this
figure
would
grow
further
to


billion
cards
manufactured
in
both
Japanese
and
American
factories

By
April
there
was
a
general
consensus
in
the
US
that
Pok
mon
had
become
a
phenomenon
and
the
newest
children
s
fad

VII
By
some
the
fad
was
referred
to
as
Pok
mania
VIII
including
journalists
of
Time
and
USA
Today

In
the
US
severe
scarcity
occurred
of
Pok
mon
goods
especially
Pok
mon
cards
causing
companies
to
miss
profits

A
Milwaukee
Journal
Sentinel
article
published
on
August
cited
a
Toys
R
Us
manager
as
saying
that
a
supply
of
booster
packs
would
last
hours

The
CEO
of
one
card
distributor
stated
that
they
were
thousands
of
boxes
behind
on
orders

In
the
same
article
a
Wizards
spokeswoman
stated
that
more
employees
and
printers
had
been
hired
to
increase
card
production

However
near
the
end
of
the
month
a
different
Wizards
spokeswoman
told
The
Washington
Post
that
they
had
exhausted
most
of
the
card
printing
capacity
of
the
United
States


Similarly
USA
Today
reported
in
November
that
factories
making
Hasbro
s
Pok
mon
toys
had
expanded
production
by
times
but
demand
still
exceeded
supply

In
Europe
scarcity
of
Pok
mon
merchandise
also
occurred

In
part
due
to
the
Pok
mon
craze
Nintendo
saw
a
increase
in
profits
in
compared
to
the
previous
year
reaching
a
six
year
high

The
Pok
mon
franchise
accounted
for
over
of
Nintendo
s
revenue
that
year

Pok
mon
s
popularity
also
caused
a
sharp
increase
in
sales
of
the
Game
Boy
line

The
financial
windfalls
came
at
a
time
when
Nintendo
lost
dominance
in
the
home
console
market
with
the
Nintendo
being
outsold
by
Sony
s
PlayStation

The
global
success
of
Pok
mon
compensated
this
loss
somewhat

IX
Buckingham
Sefton
Green
went
even
further
writing
in
while
Nintendo
is
now
among
Japan
s
most
profitable
corporations
it
could
be
argued
that
the
company
would
have
struggled
to
survive
without
Pok
mon


Kids
initially
a
little
known
firm
expanded
thirty
times
in
revenues
and
was
named
the
fastest
growing
company
in
America
in
the
September
issue
of
Fortune
magazine

Many
businesses
that
timely
obtained
a
Pok
mon
license
reaped
considerable
profits

In
the
summer
of
a
massive
run
on
stocks
of
publicly
traded
Pok
mon
licensees
caused
their
value
to
increase
dramatically

However
by
November
most
investors
were
shorting
their
shares

Realizing
that
Pok
mon
was
a
fad
that
would
peak
and
fall
at
some
point
investors
were
bearish
about
its
prospects

Pok

The
First
Movie
premiered
in
North
America
on
November
and
in
Europe
the
following
year

Despite
being
negatively
received
by
many
Western
critics
it
became
one
of
the
most
successful
Japanese
animated
films
of
all
time

In
the
United
States
November
was
estimated
to
have
been
the
peak
of
Pok

Supporting
the

was
a
promotional
action
with
Burger
King
one
of
the
largest
in
the
history
of
the
fast

industry

The
success
of
the
promotion
resulted
in
supply
issues
restaurants
often
ran
out
of

they
would

Dockery
noted
that

both
a
marketing
perspective
and
really
a
legal
perspective
it
would
not
be
to

s
advantage
to
keep
pushing
that
slogan


By
the
relationship
between
Pok
mon
USA
PUSA
and
Wizards
of
the
Coast
had
deteriorated

That
year
at
least
seven
high
profile
employees
were
poached
from
Wizards
by
PUSA
Wizard
s
former
art
director
senior
graphic
designer
business
manager
events
marketing
director
project
management
director
and
two
vice
presidents

All
employees
had
signed
NDAs

In
March
PUSA
told
Wizards
that
their
contract
would
not
be
renewed
and
that
Wizards
would
not
be
distributing
the
new
Ruby
Sapphire
card
set

Later
Wizards
was
also
prohibited
from
releasing
the
sets
Jamboree
and
Legendary
Collection
II

Notably
Jamboree
was
the
first
set
containing
cards
designed
by
Wizards
themselves

As
considerable
time
and
money
was
invested
into
creating
them
Wizards
was
upset
when
they
were
barred
from
putting
them
out

On
October
the
day
after
their
agreement
expired
Wizards
filed
suit
against
Pok
mon
USA
alleging
that
the
defendant
had
seized
their
intellectual
property
and
trade
secrets
and
illegally
tried
to
gain
advantage
over
them
in
the
competitive
trading
card
market

The
case
was
settled
out
of
court

Jamboree
and
Legendary
Collection
II
have
remained
unreleased

In
October
Kids
Entertainment
signed
a
new
contract
with
PUSA
continuing
to
serve
as
Pok
mon
s
exclusive
licensing
agent
and
anime
localizer

On
December
it
was
announced
that
the
agreement
would
not
be
renewed
and
would
expire
on
December
with
PUSA
moving
all
licensing
in
house

The
localization
of
the
anime
would
be
done
by
PUSA
in
cooperation
with
TAJ
Productions

PUSA
proceeded
to
replace
almost
all
of
the
original
English
voice
actors
who
were
still
under
contract
with
Kids

This
decision
raised
the
ire
of
fans
and
the
actors
themselves


According
to
Stuart
Zagnit
who
voiced
Professor
Oak
the
recasting
was
done
to
cut
back
on
costs

In
March
Pok

UK
was
established
in
London
as
a
British
representative
of
The

Following

Pok
mon
Diamond
and
Pearl
were
released
for
the
Nintendo
DS
on
September
in
Japan
and
on
April
in
North
America

A
third
version
Pok
mon
Platinum
was
released
on
September
in
Japan
and
on
March
in
North
America

They
form
the
fourth
generation
Generation
IV
in
the
Pok
mon
video
game
series

Diamond
and
Pearl
were
designed
based
on
the
DS
s
various
features
such
as
its
Wi
Fi
capabilities
and
slot
for
Game
Boy
Advance
cartridge

Pok
mon
president
Tsunekazu
Ishihara
dubbed
the
games
as
the
ultimate
Pok
mon
titles
because
they
allowed
the
player
to
trade
and
battle
Pok
mon
including
every
Pok
mon
from
previous
iterations
globally
through
WiFi
as
opposed
to
previously
only
able
to
do
so
locally
and
with
fewer
Pok
mon

The
games
characters
are
D
and
the
environments
are
rendered
in
D
and
it
is
considerably
difficult
to
differentiate
them
because
Game
Freak
designed
them
this
way
to
innovate
the
graphics
while
also
retaining
the
traditional
game
style
and
feel

In
Platinum
the
developers
focused
on
changing
the
most
essential
elements
from
Diamond
and
Pearl
to
maintain
continuity
with
the
previous
games

Director
Junichi
Masuda
stated
that
since
they
designed
Diamond
and
Pearl
as
the
ultimate
Pok
mon
titles
it
was
only
necessary
to
make
Platinum
even
stronger
than
them

They
approached
this
by
designing
the
Origin
Forme
for
the
legendary
Pok
mon
Giratina
ensuring
that
the
design
would
appear
significantly
different
from
its
regular
form
in
Diamond
and
Pearl
and
to
express
the
games
core
antimatter
and
Distortion
World
concepts

The
title
Platinum
was
chosen
to
reflect
a
precious
material
that
shines
and
is
different
from
diamond
and
pearl
and
their
associations
of
love
and
happiness
respectively

Pok
mon
HeartGold
and
SoulSilver
were
released
on
September
in
Japan
and
on
March
in
North
America
as
part
of
Generation
IV

They
are
remakes
of
Gold
and
Silver
aiming
to
balance
familiarity
for
the
original
games
players
and
new
content
for
newcomers

The
titles
reflected
the
theme
of
the
bond
between
trainers
and
their
Pok
mon

The
developers
faithfully
recreated
the
original
story
and
added
elements
from
the
Generation
IV
games
and
Yellow
the
latter
of
which
was
released
concurrently
with
Gold
and

merged

Company
International
TPCi


This
subsidiary
of
The
Pok
mon
Company
TPC
has
since
managed
the
Pok
mon
franchise
outside
of
Asia

In
Generation
V
Pok
mon
Black
and
White
were
released
on
September
in
Japan
for
the
DS
and
on
March
in
North
America

The
games
feature
enhanced
visual
effects
and
increased
use
of
D
graphics

The
developers
excluded
old
Pok
mon
and
strategies
while
introducing
over
new
Pok
mon
to
evoke
a
sense
of
novelty
and
to
provide
new
players
a
more
leveled
playing
field
against
old
players

The
games
seek
to
attract
both
new
players
and
returning
players
through
its
detailed
walkthrough
and
the
addition
of
C
Gear
a
real
time
communication
tool
to
improve
the
trade
and
battle
experiences
respectively

The
games
were
followed
by
Pok
mon
Black
and
White
which
were
released
on
June
in
Japan
and
on
October
in
North
America

The
games
were
developed
for
the
DS
rather
than
the
more
powerful
Nintendo
DS
to
maintain
continuity
with
the
game
world
in
Black
and
White
and
they
were
presented
from
a
different
perspective
in
the
storyline

Since
the
games
are
their
first
sequels
director
Masuda
explained
that
they
have
strived
to
find
a
fine
balance
to
appeal
to
both
newcomers
and
returning
players
by
implementing
introductory
explanations
and
by
placing
a
Pok
mon
Center
in
the
first
in
game
city
they
were
able
to
further
this
approach
by
providing
newcomers
with
a
detailed
walkthrough
and
also
returning
players
with
new
updates

During
development
phase
director
Takao
Unno
revealed
that
they
had
experimented
with
a
player
multiplayer
experience
via
their
communication
feature
Entralink
drawing
from
their
vision
of
players
sharing
the
same
space
same
time
and
same
game
but
this
feature
was
never
implemented
due
to
technical
limitations

D
Generation
VI
VII
Pok
mon
Go
In
Generation
VI
Pok
mon
X
and
Y
were
released
worldwide
for
the
DS
on
October
and
they
are
the
first
games
to
be
released
in
this
way

The
developers
focused
on
the
themes
of
beauty
bond
and
evolution
and
it
is
based
on
these
themes
that
they
created
the
games
core
mechanic
where
Pok
mon
could
achieve
a
higher
form
of
evolution
by
strengthening
their
bonds
with
trainers
however
to
maintain
game
balance
they
limited
this
feature
to
a
special
temporary
phenomenon

The
games
shift
to
fully
D
graphics
allowed
the
player
to
freely
manipulate
the
camera
angles
although
due
to
technical
limitations
objects
far
away
are
rendered
in
lower
polygon
models
and
producer
Hitoshi
Yamagami
addressed
to
D
players
that
Game
Freak
developers
are
also
big
fans
of
D
graphics



So
there
are
some
elements
in
there
that
I
Yamagami
think
fans
of
D
will
appreciate
as
well

When
asked
about
the
Horde
battle
and
Sky
battle
types
he
stated
that
Horde
battles
are
to
supplant
the
roles
of
really
strong
pokemon
sic
to
help
the
player
more
easily
progress
through
the
games
and
also
to
add
more
excitement
to
the
battles

Pok
mon
Omega
Ruby
and
Alpha
Sapphire
were
released
worldwide
for
the
DS
on
November
and
on
November
in
Europe
as
part
of
Generation
VI

They
are
remakes
of
Ruby
and
Sapphire

The
developers
adopted
X
and
Y
s
core
game
mechanic
and
added
enhanced
D
graphics

According
to
director
Masuda
they
reviewed
the
original
mechanic
and
concept
and
expressed
them
using
modern
hardware
such
as
replacing
the
original
Pok
Gear
feature
for
the
enhanced
versions
BuzzNav
and
DexNav
to
more
effectively
provide
information
enabled
by
the
games
hardware
capabilities

They
seek
to
explore
the
concept
of
Pok
mon
coexisting
with
humans
and
nature
revisiting
the
concept
behind
original
games
setting
which
translated
to
richness
or
abundance
in
nature
and
bonds
between
people
and
nature
in
Japanese

To
appeal
to
the
newer
audience
in
X
and
Y
the
developers
decided
to
connect
the
story
with
X
and
Y
by
further
exploring
their
core
mechanic

In
Generation
VII
Pok
mon
Sun
and
Moon
were
released
worldwide
for
the
DS
on
November
and
on
November
in
Europe

The
developers
chose
Hawaii
for
inspiration
due
to
its
distinctive
warm
sunlight
and
clear
moonlight
and
unique
biomes
that
helped
support
the
games
regional
Pok
mon
variance
concept

Ohmori
said
as
director
he
aimed
to
focus
on
the
concept
of
Pok
mon
as
these
living
creatures
and
really
focus
on
them
being
alive

Having
the
release
date
on
the
th
anniversary
of
Pok
mon
in
mind
he
treated
this
project
as
a
celebration
of
that
life
and
to
really
express
this
respect
for
life

As
he
contemplated
about
life
and
its
origins
Ohmori
considered
the
significance
of
the
Sun
enabling
life
with
its
light
and
the
Moon
s
impact
on
certain
species
reproduction

He
explained
how
the
Sun
the
Moon
and
the
Earth
work
together
to
influence
one
another
and
life
as
a
result
grows
and
flourishes
based
on
this
relationship

Ohmori
stated
that
with
the
innovation
to
D
in
X
and
Y
the
designers
decided
to
examine
more
minor
aspects
concerning
with
the
Pok
mon
themselves
such
as
their
motions
such
as
when
they
designed
the
games
first
starter
Pok
mon
to
capitalize
on
its
owl
like
characteristics
with
its
head
twists
round
and
round

With
the
DS
technologies
the
developers
are
able
to
design
the
characters
to
be
more
expressive
as
themselves
including
different
facial
expressions
and
reactions

In
addition
to
portraying
Pok
mon
harmoniously
coexisting
with
people
and
vice
versa
in
the
games
the
developers
replaced
the
traditional
Gym
mechanic
with
Island
Trials
deepening
the
players
connection
with
the
story
and
their
Pok
mon

The
enhanced
versions
Pok

Ultra
Sun
and
Ultra
Moon
were
released
worldwide
on
November


The
games
added
an
alternate
storyline
and
additional

Pok

and
other

Developer
Shigeki
Morimoto
revealed
that
they
were
developed
by
the
younger
staff
members
and
veterans
so
the
more
veterans
can
prioritized
on
developing
more
important
titles
and
the
developers
considered
them
to
be
their
culmination

In
the

franchise
spawned
a
second
worldwide
fad
with
the
release
of
Pok

a
mobile
augmented

game

The
app
originated
as
a
Google

Pok

The
prank
was
conceived
by
Tsunekazu
Ishihara
and
Satoru
Iwata

On
Ishihara
s
initiation
the
hoax
was
turned
into
an
actual
video
game
developed
by
Niantic

Ishihara
was
a
fan
of
Niantic
s
previous
transreality
game
Ingress
and
saw
the
game
s
concept
as
a
perfect
match
for
Pok

Through
in

purchases
the
game
generated
more
than
million

the
end
of
July
with
App

reporting
that
Pok

had
generated
around

beating
every

set

The

Yellow
the

seek
to
introduce
newcomers
and
a
new
generation
of
players
particularly
Pok

Go
players
to
the

in

Generation
VIII
debuted
with
the
release
of
Pok
mon
Sword
and
Shield
on
November
for
the
Switch

Director
Shigeru
Ohmori
stated
that
they
designed
the
games
based
on
what
they
believed
of
the
biggest
Pok
mon
theme
of
becoming
being
the
greatest
or
strongest
which
was
expressed
in
the
games
Dynamax
Gigantamax
Pok
mon
core
mechanic
and
the
games
increasingly
powerful
software
and
hardware
capabilities

Ohmori
further
revealed
that
through
developing
the
Let
s
Go
games
as
research
projects
for
the
Switch
they
were
able
to
gain
valuable
experiences
and
knowledge
to
develop
Sword
and
Shield

He
noted
that
they
took
advantage
of
the
Switch
s
high
resolution
and
TV
connectivity
to
implement
the
games
gigantic
size
core
Pok
mon
mechanic

They
envisioned
the
games
setting
to
be
a
wide
open
space
that
is
different
from
the
traditional
route
systems
and
is
constantly
changing
where
the
player
can
meet
and
explore
with
other
players

Many
pre
existing
Pok
mon
are
not
available
in
Sword
and
Shield

This
Dexit
as
it
was
called
led
to
fan
backlash

Sword
and
Shield
were
the
first
Pok
mon
games
to
receive
DLC
expansions
Part
The
Isle
of
Armor
and
Part

Crown

they
were
released
on
June
and
October
respectively

They
include
additional
storylines
places
Pok
mon
characters
and
other
features

In
the
COVID
pandemic
broke
out

The
resulting
widespread
ennui
and
excessive
leisure
time
inspired
a
resurgence
in
popularity
and
interest
of
Pok
mon
cards
which
was
further
popularized
by
various
YouTubers
and
other
influencers
such
as
Logan
Paul

The
craze
resulted
in
severe
supply
shortages
and
customers
inappropriate
and
obsessive
behavior
raised
safety
concerns
in
many
retail
outlets

Pok
mon
cards
values
skyrocketed
prompting
collectors
to
submit
cards
and
overwhelm
card
grading
agencies

The
Pok
mon
Company
responded
by
reprinting
impacted
products
at
maximum
capacity
to
ensure
price
stabilization
and
general
accessibility

Remakes
of
Diamond
and
Pearl
Pok
mon
Brilliant
Diamond
and
Shining
Pearl
were
released
on
November
for
the

as
part
of
Generation

They
are
the
first
core
series
games
to
be
developed
by
a
third
party
developer
ILCA
rather
than
Game
Freak

The
developers
revealed
that
the
games
would
not
assume
the
anticipated
style
of
the
Let
s
Go
Games
and
feature
traditional
game
mechanics

Pok
mon
intends
to
celebrate
their
th
anniversary
with
the
release
of
the
remakes
by
revisiting
old
games
and
mechanics
which
they
faithfully
reproduced
with
enhanced
D
graphics

Pok
mon
Legends
Arceus
was
released
on
January
for
the
Switch
as
a
prequel
to
Diamond
and
Pearl

It
is
part
of
Generation
VIII

The
game
represents
a
new
approach
for
the
Pok
mon
video
game
series
as
it
transitions
from
traditional
RPG
mechanics
to
add
real
time
elements
in
their
games

Unlike
traditional
Pok
mon
games
the
player
can
catch
Pok
mon
by
throwing
a
Pok
Ball
in
real
time
rather
than
triggering
a
battle
however
they
can
still
choose
the
latter
to
weaken
it
for
capture

Many
in
game
aspects
particularly
its
landscape
heavily
resemble
those
of
The
Legend
of

as

and
it
also
departed
from
the
traditional
gym
mechanics
and
the

In
and
Pok
mon
was
an
unprecedented
ubiquitous
fad
in
the
Western
world

Time
magazine
described
it
as
a
multimedia
and
interactive
barrage
like
no
other
before
it


The
franchise
primarily
aimed
at
children
elicited
mixed
responses
from
parents
and
teachers
some
of
them
critical

Yano
even
claimed
that
the
reactions
at
one
point
constituted
a
moral
panic

The
bulk
of
the
criticism
on
Pok
mon
was
directed
at
the
trading
cards
in
particular
the
booster
packs
sealed
packages
of
f
randomly
inserted
cards
that
were
sold
separately
from
the
main
sets

The
cards
are
of
varying
scarcity
the
most
valuable
being
the
holofoil
cards
also
called
holographic
or
foil
cards
in
which
the
illustrations
of
the
Pok
mon
have
a
shiny
overlay
effect

The
rare
cards
can
only
be
found
in
booster
packs
and
the
rarest
ones
are
very
infrequently
included

Tobin
notes
that
rarity
in
this
case
is
artificially
created
and
effectively
a
form
of
gambling
in
which
children
need
to
repeatedly
purchase
booster
packs
to
get
more
rare
cards

Broug
re
described
a
cynicism
among
adults
that
corporations
could
apparently
out
of
thin
air
ascribe
value
to
cards
which
they
saw
as
valueless
thereby
deceiving
vulnerable
young
consumers
and
garnering
excessive
profits


As
the
franchise
s
popularity
grew
children
began
taking
their
Pok
mon
cards
to
school
for
trading
and
playing

Soon
the
cards
were
alleged
to
be
disrupting
learning
poisoning
playground
friendships
and
causing
such
distraction
that
some
children
forget
their
homework
tune
out
in
class
and
even
miss
school
buses
as
they
scramble
to
acquire
one
more
card


The
cards
were
turning
the
playground
into
a
black
market
with
card
swaps
sometimes
inciting
conflicts

Certain
children
engaged
in
aggressive
trading
tricking
other
often
younger
kids
into
unfair
deals
forcing
teachers
to
arbitrate

XI
Some
parents
expressed
their
concerns
about
the
craze
but
feared
that
their
children
would
be
ostracized
if
they
were
to
deny
them
Pok
mon
products

In
the
US
the
Pok
mon
cards
ended
up
almost
universally
banned
from
school
grounds

Similar
bans
occurred
in
Canada
Australia
New
Zealand
and
European
countries

In
September
US
based
law
firm
Milberg
filed
a
class
action
lawsuit
against
Nintendo
of
America
Wizards
of
the
Coast
and
Kids

The
suit
claimed
that
the
booster
packs
constitute
a
form
of
lottery
and
promote
gambling
in
kids

Susan
Estrich
noted
that
similar
lawsuits
had
been
filed
against
trading
card
makers
in
the
US
without
success

The
Pok
mon
card
suit
is
not
known
to
have
gone
to
court
and
is
believed
to
have
been
settled

j
The
Pok
mon
anime
series
was
criticized
by
some
as
cheap
Japanese
animation
that
is
violent
and
has
little
educational
value


Michelle
Orecklin
of
Time
dismissed
the
TV
series
as
less
a
cartoon
than
a
half
hour
exercise
in
Pok
mon
product
placement


Allison
wrote
that
even
those
within
Pok
mon
s
US
marketing
team
agreed
that
the
anime
s
visuals

Pok
mon
The
First
Movie
premiered
in
the
United
States
on
November
and
in
European
countries
in
February


While
a
huge
box
office
success
the
film
was
received
negatively
by
several
Western
film
critics

The
Guardian
decried
it
as
a
contemptuously
cheap
animated
cash
in
on
the
monster
kids
craze


The
American
adult
animated
series
South
Park
satirized
Pok
mon
in
the
episode
Chinpokomon
aired
on
November


In
the
episode
the
titular
media
franchise
is
portrayed
as
a
low
quality
line
of
products
that
is
part
of
an
evil
plan
by
the
Japanese
government
to
invade
the
US

South
Park
co
creator
Matt
Stone
commented
that
at
the
time
Pok
mon
was
scary
huge


Kohler
wrote
that
Pok
mon
was
considered
ruthlessly
commercial
and
that
it
program
med
children
to
be
consumers
of
anything
and
everything
Pok
mon


CNN
quoted
child
psychiatrist
John
Lochridge
as
worrying
that
Pok
mon
s
creators
and
marketers
deliberately
set
out
to
create
a
fantasy
world
so
compelling
that
children
would
quickly
become
obsessed


He
believed
that
kids
were
being
brainwashed
and
said
I
have
had
parents
tell
me
that
they
cannot
get
their
kids
to
do
anything
except
Pok
mon
so
this
stuff
seems
to
really
capture
their
minds
in
a
way


These
concerns
were
countered
by
psychologist
William
Damon
who
told
Newsweek
that
obsessing
is
in
fact
a
normal
part
of
a
child
s
neurological
development

It
should
concern
parents
only
when
the
obsession
gets
dangerous
or
excessive

An
op
ed
in
the
New
Zealander
newspaper
The
Dominion
Post
claimed
that
the
anti
Pok
mon
sentiment
was
particularly
American
The
backlash
which
seems
largely
confined
to
the
United
States
may
be
no
more
than
the
sound
of
the
world
s
leading
cultural
imperialist
gagging
on
a
taste
of
its
own
medicine


As
Pok
mania
built
Western
media
started
reporting
on
several
crimes
associated
with
Pok
mon

These
included
violence
including
two
reported
stabbings
burglaries
robberies
some
at
knifepoint
and
shoplifting

Almost
all
these
incidents
were
connected
to
the
Pok
mon
cards
and
the
individuals
involved
were
almost
always
underage

In
the
US
the
incidents
peaked
in
November


In
England
Pok
mon
related
delinquency
reached
a
head
in
April


High
prices
on
the
grey
market
were
a
motive
behind
some
of
the
crimes
posing
a
great
temptation
for
older
kids
and
bullies
to
take
advantage
of
weaker
children


At
specialty
shops
and
online
auctions
a
rare
Pok
mon
card
could
be
bought
and
sold
for
or
more
c

in


Aside
from
the
negative
reactions
many
media
also
cited
alleged
beneficial
effects
of
Pok
mon

It
was
noted
that
the
video
games
and
the
cards
require
children
to
read
memorize
calculate
and
plan
out
a
strategy

Both
encourage
socialization
and
trading
Pok
mon
requires
negotiating
skills

Stephanie
Strom
wrote
in
The
New
York
Times
that
the
Pok
mon
anime
taught
children
traditional
Japanese
values
responsibility
empathy
cooperation
obedience
respect
for
elders
humility


Anne
Allison
interviewed
various
American
parents
during
Pok
mania

She
found
that
while
most
of
them
were
utterly
mystified
about
Pok
mon
few
were
overly
worried
about
it
instead
meeting
the
craze
with
befuddled
acceptance


Allison
also
notes
that
the
Columbine
High
School
massacre
occurred
during
Pok
mania
on
April
causing
violent
television
music
and
games
to
be
scrutinized

Compared
to
these
media
she
notes
Pok
mon
is
in
fact
rather
tame

In
contrast
Pok
mon
received
far
less
criticism
in
its
native
country
of
Japan

Yano
attributes
this
to
cultural
differences
which
includes
greater
acceptance
of
exuberant
consumerism
to
buy
is
to
be
a
good
citizen
less
focus
on
media
influence
instead
Japan
s
educational
system
bullying
and
dysfunctional
families
are
more
often
the
target
of
attention
less
separation
between
child
and
adulthood
what
is
suitable
for
adults
is
not
necessarily
considered
unsuitable
for
kids
Pok
mon
being
permeated
with
kawaisa
cuteness
a
hallmark
of
Japanese
culture
Japan
s
core
religions
Buddhism
and
Shinto
are
less
moralizing
in
nature

However
Oliver
Burkeman
wrote
in
The
Guardian
that
the
Pok
mon
cards
were
also
banned
from
some
Japanese
schools

After
World
War
II
Japan
experienced
a
period
of
unprecedented
growth
and
became
well
known
in
the
Western
world
for
its
consumer
products
such
as
radios
e
g

Panasonic
Toshiba
cars
e
g

Toyota
Mitsubishi
and
Sony
s
Walkman

From
onwards
its
economy
stagnated
causing
the
country
to
lose
its
status
as
an
economic
superpower

However
during
the
s
and
s
Japan
re
emerged
as
a
source
of
cool
cultural
goods
embraced
by
a
growing
international
audience
interested
in
Japanese
culture

XII
Nintendo
Sega
and
Sony
launched
several
popular
video
game
consoles
and
franchises

In
terms
of
children
s
properties
the
success
of
Mighty
Morphin
Power
Rangers
changed
perceptions
on
the
viability
of
such
Japanese
imports
in
the
West

The
Tamagotchi
fad
centered
around
a
portable
digital
pet
device
was
said
to
have
paved
the
way
for
Pok
mon


Anne
Allison
wrote
that
before
the
s
Japan
figured
little
in
the
face
of
the
worldwide
hegemony
of
Euro
American
cultural
industries
in
particular
that
of
the
US

Hollywood
has
been
hostile
to
imports
she
wrote
and
foreignness
has
largely
been
and
been
seen
as
an
impediment
to
mass
popularization
in
the
United
States


The
surprise
success
of
Pok
mon
was
an
undeniable
breakthrough
in
the
homeland
of
Disney
that
changed
preexisting
assumptions
about
the
US
marketplace
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
constantly
resisted
for
deviating
from
them


Pok
mon
was
a
welcomed
boon
to
Japan
s
faltering
economy
and
positively
influenced
the
country
s
soft
power

Kamo
interviewed
various
American
children
and
found
that
kids
who
thought
Pok
mon
was
cool
were
more
likely
to
believe
that
Japan
was
a
cool
nation

Allison
gave
a
similar
finding
all
the
children
she
interviewed
knew
where
Pok
mon
originated
and
many
said
that
as
a
result
of
Pok
mon
and
other
cool
Japanese
goods
they
had
developed
an
interest
in
Japan

A
number
said
that
they
now
wanted
to
study
Japanese
and
travel
there
one
day


Kohler
wrote
Japanese
are
proud
of
Pok
mon
the
most
successful
export
of
Japanese
popular
culture
ever


Although
Iwabuchi
questioned
to
what
extent
Pok
mon
really
is
Japanese
and
to
what
extent
it
is
simply
a
good
property
with
universal
appeal

He
noted
that
Japanese
nationalist
commentators
celebrated
Pok
mon
s
global
success
and
retrospectively
attributed
this
to
its
Japanese
cultural
power
while
ignoring
the
localization
of
Pok
mon
overseas
as
well
as
decades
of
increasing
cooperation
and
cultural
exchange
between
countries
globalization


In
the
th
century
anime
found
niche
popularity
in
North
America
and
Europe
in
series
Astro
Boy
Kimba
the
White
Lion
Speed
Racer
and
films
Akira
Ghost

The
Pok
mon
TV
series
and
films
marked
a
breakthrough
for
anime
contributing
to
its
growing
worldwide
success
at
the
turn
of
the
st
century

XIV
For
some
children
Pok
mon
was
their
introduction
to
Japanimation
serving
as
a
gateway
to
other
anime
manga
and
Japanese
culture
in
general

Pok
mon
The
First
Movie
became
one
of
the
most
successful
Japanese
animated
films
in
history

After
Princess
Mononoke
Pok
mon
The
First
Movie
became
the
second
anime
film
to
open
at
mainstream
cinemas
in
the
West
as
opposed
to
the
usual
art
house
venues

Pioneering
anime
importer
John
Ledford
noted
that
Pok
mon
underscored
the
commercial
potential
of
anime
thus
making
it
interesting
from
a
business
perspective

In
the
field
of
video
games
the
main
Pok
mon
series
became
the
standard
within
the
monster
taming
game
genre
a
subtype
of
RPGs

While
not
the
first
to
use
this
concept
the
Pok
mon
games
became
so
synonymous
with
it
that
later
titles
involving
catching
and
training
monsters
of
any
genre
were
inevitably
compared
to
Pok
mon

Examples
of
this
include
Dragon
Warrior
Monsters
XV
Robopon
Sun
and
Star
Spectrobes
XVI
Invizimals
XVII
Monster
Crown
XVIII
and
Palworld


XIX
The
success
of
Pok
mon
encouraged
companies
to
look
for
other
popular
Japanese
properties
that
might
be
localized
for
Western
markets

The
importing
of
at
least
three
similar
franchises
were
confirmed
by
business
executives
to
have
been
partly
inspired
by
Pok
mon
Yu
Gi
Oh
Digimon
and
Monster
Rancher

The
import
of
Cardcaptor
Sakura
as
Cardcaptors
might
also
have
been
prompted
by
Pok
mon

From
the
original
Base
Set
to
the
Neo
Destiny
sets
the
booster
packs
contained

After
that
and
throughout
the
third
generation
EX
sets
the
booster
packs
contained
cards

From
the
fourth
generation
Diamond
and
Pearl
sets
onwards
the
packs
contained
cards

Since
the
seventh
generation
Sun
and
Moon
sets
the
packs
have
again
contained
cards



A
definitive
number
could
not
be
established

The
Fire
and
Disaster
Management
Agency
announced
that
as
of
December
a
total
of
people
had
been
taken
to
hospitals
in
direct
relationship
to
the
Pokemon
episode

Of
these
people
were
actually
hospitalized

However
different
figures
have
been
stated
by
different
sources

According
to
Hatakeyama
Kubo
approximately
children
were
taken
to
hospitals
of
which
were
hospitalized

It
has
been
reported
that
due
to
the
incident
catching
the
country
off
guard
different
methods
of
surveying
were
used
throughout
Japan
and
these
methods
were
not
always
accurate



However
Sailor
Moon
did
gain
a
cult
following
at
the
time

After
being
pulled
from
syndication
in
spring
due
to
low
ratings
it
was
broadcast
again
on
USA
Network
from
June
to
March


The
anime
subsequently
had
a
successful
run
on
Cartoon
Network
s
Toonami
block
from
June
to
July
a
timeframe
that
overlapped
Pok
mania



Shogakukan
kept
this
condition
until


As
of
update
the
last
animated
Pok
mon
feature
is
Pokemon
Coco
released
in
Japan
on
December


It
was
released
worldwide
excluding
Japan
Korea
and
China
as
Pok
mon
the
Movie
Secrets
of
the
Jungle
on
October


Between
and
a
total
of
anime
films
were
released



In
her
book
Millennial
Monsters
Anne
Allison
mentions
the
card
suit
and
writes
within
parentheses
that
it
was
eventually
settled
out
of
court


However
she
does
not
cite
a

for
this

But
a
New
Wave
of
Japanese
Monsters
Threatens

But
Pokemon
was
different

Pokemon
monsters
famously
do
not
die
they
simply
suffer
a
cute
fainting
fit

And
it
s
this
emphasis
on
non
violent
problem
solving
and
group
action
which
also
informs
the
new
shows

It
s
certainly
hard
to
make
charges
of
violence
stick
Pok
mon
fights
are
ceremonial
and
impeccably
polite
in
a
uniquely
Japanese
way
and
the
monsters
never
die
anyway
they
just
faint
before
rejuvenating
themselves
at
special

hospitals

Ishihara

was
fond
of
card
games
and
used
that

to
advise
on
how
to

To
be

things
like
the
Pokemon
types
the
link
cable
battles
and
the
Pokedex
were
all
added
later
in

While
feared
and
envied
in
the
West
Japan
s
success
in
exporting
cultural
products
led
to
the
emergence
in
the
s
of
a
chauvinistic
self
praising
discourse
in
Japan

Flush
with
nationalistic
pride
Japanese
social
commentators
suddenly
found
a
specifically
Japanese
fragrance
in
these
previously
culturally
odorless
products

It
is
important
to
locate
the
global
popularity
of
Pok
mon
and
of
Japanese
animation
and
computer
games
in
general
within
a
wider
picture
of
the
increasing
interconnectedness
of
transnational
media
industries
and

an
interconnectedness
that
in
turn
reflects
larger
processes
of
