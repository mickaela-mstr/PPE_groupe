Urban
legend
v
t
e
Urban
legends
sometimes
modern
legend
urban
myth
or
simply
legend
is
a
genre
of
folklore
concerning
stories
about
an
unusual
usually
scary
or
humorous
event
that
many
people
believe
to
be
true
but
largely
are
not

These
legends
can
be
entertaining
but
often
concern
mysterious
peril
or
troubling
events
such
as
disappearances
and
strange
objects
or
entities

Urban
legends
may
confirm
moral
standards
reflect
prejudices
or
be
a
way
to
make
sense
of
societal
anxieties

In
the
past
urban
legends
were
most
often
circulated
orally
at
gatherings
and
around
the
campfire
for
instance

Now
they
can
be
spread
by
any
media
including
newspapers
mobile
news
apps
e
mail
and
most
often
social
media

Some
urban
legends
have
passed
through
the
years
decades
with
only
minor
changes
in
where
the
time
period
takes
place

Generic
urban
legends
are
often
altered
to
suit
regional
variations
but
the
lesson
or
moral
generally
remains
the
same

Origin
and
structure
edit
The
term
urban
legend
as
used
by
folklorists
has
appeared
in
print
since
at
least
when
it
was
used
by
Richard
Dorson

Jan
Harold
Brunvand
professor
of
English
at
the
University
of
Utah
introduced
the
term
to
the
general
public
in
a
series
of
popular
books
published
beginning
in


Brunvand
used
his
collection
of
legends
The
Vanishing
Hitchhiker
American
Urban
Legends
Their
Meanings
to
make
two
points
first
that
legends
and
folklore
do
not
occur
exclusively
in
so
called
primitive
or
traditional
societies
and
second
that
one
could
learn
much
about
urban
and
modern
culture
by
studying
such
tales

Many
urban
legends
are
framed
as
complete
stories
with
plot
and
characters

The
compelling
appeal
of
a
typical
urban
legend
is
its
elements
of
mystery
horror
fear
or
humor

Often
they
serve
as
cautionary
tales

Some
urban
legends
are
morality
tales
that
depict
someone
acting
in
a
disagreeable
manner
only
to
wind
up
in
trouble
hurt
or
dead

Urban
legends
will
often
try
to
invoke
a
feeling
of
disgust
in
the
reader
which
tends
to
make
these
stories
more
memorable
and
potent

Elements
of
shock
value
can
be
found
in
almost
every
form
of
urban
legend
and
are
partially
what
makes
these
tales
so
impactful

An
urban
legend
may
include
elements
of
the
supernatural
or
paranormal

Propagation
and
belief
edit
As
Jan
Brunvand
points
out
antecedent
legends
including
some
of
the
motifs
themes
and
symbolism
of
the
urtexts
can
readily
be
identified

Cases
that
may
have
been
at
least
partially
inspired
by
real
events
include
The
Death
Car
traced
by
Richard
Dorson
to
Michigan
United
States
the
Solid
Cement
Cadillac
and
the
possible
origin
of
The
Hook
in
the
series
of
Lovers
Lane
murders
in
Texarkana
Texas
United
States

The
urban
legend
that
Coca
Cola
developed
the
drink
Fanta
to
sell
in
Nazi
Germany
without
public
backlash
originated
as
the
actual
tale
of
German
Max
Keith
who
invented
the
drink
and
ran
Coca
Cola
s
operations
in
Germany
during
World
War
II

The
narrator
of
an
urban
legend
may
claim
it
happened
to
a
friend
or
to
a
friend
of
a
friend
which
serves
to
personalize
authenticate
and
enhance
the
power
of
the
narrative
while
distancing
the
teller
from
the
tall
tale

Many
urban
legends
depict
horrific
crimes
contaminated
foods
or
other
situations
that
would
potentially
affect
many
people

Anyone
believing
such
stories
might
feel
compelled
to
warn
loved
ones

On
occasion
news
organizations
school
officials
and
even
police
departments
have
issued
warnings
concerning
the
latest
threat

According
to
the
Lights
Out
rumor
street
gang
members
would
drive
without
headlights
until
a
compassionate
motorist
responded
with
the
traditional
flashing
of
headlights
whereupon
a
prospective
new
gang
member
would
have
to
murder
the
citizen
as
a
requirement
of
initiation

A
fax
retelling
this
legend
received
at
the
Nassau
County
Florida
fire
department
was
forwarded
to
police
and
from
there
to
all
city
departments

The
Minister
of
Defence
for
Canada
was
taken
in
by
it
also
he
forwarded
an
urgent
security
warning
to
all
Ontario
Members
of
Parliament

Urban
legends
typically
include
common
elements
the
tale
is
retold
on
behalf
of
the
original
witness
or
participant
dire
warnings
are
often
given
for
those
who
might
not
heed
the
advice
or
lesson
contained
therein
a
typical
element
of
many
e
mail
phishing
scams
and
the
tale
is
often
touted
as
something
a
friend
told
me
the
friend
being
identified
by
first
name
only
or
not
identified
at
all

Such
legends
seem
to
be
believable
and
even
provocative
as
some
readers
are
led
in
turn
to
pass
them
on
including
on
social
media
platforms
that
instantly
reach
millions
worldwide

Many
are
essentially
extended
jokes
told
as
if
they
were
true
events

Persistent
urban
legends
do
often
maintain
a
degree
of
plausibility
as
in
the
story
a
serial
killer
deliberately
hiding
in
the
back
seat
of
a
car

Another
such
example
since
the
s
has
been
the
recurring
rumor
that
the
Procter
Gamble
Company
was
associated
with
Satan
worshippers
because
of
details
within
its
th
century
trademark

The
legend
interrupted
the
company
s
business
to
the
point
that
it
stopped
using
the
trademark

Relation
to
mythology
edit
The
earliest
term
by
which
these
narratives
were
known
urban
belief
tales
highlights
what
was
then
thought
of
as
a
key
property
their
tellers
regarded
the
stories
as
true
accounts
and
the
device
of
the
FOAF
acronym
for
Friend
of
a
Friend
invented
by
English
writer
and
folklorist
Rodney
Dale
in
was
a
spurious
but
significant
effort
at
authentication

The
coinage
leads
in
turn
to
the
terms
FOAFlore
and
FOAFtale


While
at
least
one
classic
legend
the
Death
Car
has
been
shown
to
have
some
basis
in
fact
folklorists
have
an
interest
in
debunking
those
narratives
only
to
the
degree
that
establishing
non
factuality
warrants
the
assumption
that
there
must
be
some
other
reason
why
the
tales
are
told
re
told
and
believed

As
in
the
case
of
myth
the
narratives
are
believed
because
they
construct
and
reinforce
the
worldview
of
the
group
within
which
they
are
told
or
because
they
provide
us
with
coherent
and
convincing
explanations
of
complex
events


Social
scientists
have
started
to
draw
on
urban
legends
in
order
to
help
explain
complex
socio
psychological
beliefs
such
as
attitudes
to
crime
childcare
fast
food
SUVs
and
other
family
choices

The
authors
make
an
explicit
connection
between
urban
legends
and
popular
folklore
such
as
Grimm
s
Fairy
Tales
where
similar
themes
and
motifs
arise

For
that
reason
it
is
characteristic
of
groups
within
which
a
given
narrative
circulates
to
vehemently
reject
claims
or
demonstrations
of
non
factuality
an
example
would
be
the
expressions
of
outrage
by
police
officers
who
are
told
that
adulteration
of
Halloween
treats
by
strangers
the
subject
of
periodic
moral
panics
occurs
extremely
rarely
if
at
all

Documentation
edit
The
Internet
has
made
it
easier
both
to
spread
and
to
debunk
urban
legends

For
instance
the
Usenet
newsgroup
alt
folklore
urban
and
several
other
websites
most
notably
snopes
com
focus
on
discussing
tracking
and
analyzing
urban
legends

The
United
States
Department
of
Energy
had
a
now
discontinued
service
called
Hoaxbusters
that
dealt
with
computer
distributed
hoaxes
and
legends

The
most
notable
such
hoaxes
are
known
as
creepypastas
which
are
typically
horror
stories
written
anonymously

Although
most
are
regarded
as
obviously
false
some
such
as
the
Slender
Man
have
gained
a
following
of
people
that
do
believe
in
them

Television
shows
such
as
Urban
Legends
Beyond
Belief
Fact
or
Fiction
and
later
Mostly
True
Stories
Urban
Legends
Revealed
feature
re
enactments
of
urban
legends
detailing
the
accounts
of
the
tales
and
typically
later
in
an
episode
revealing
any
factual
basis
they
may
have

The
Discovery
Channel
TV
show
MythBusters
tried
to
prove
or
disprove
several
urban
legends
by
attempting
to
reproduce
them
using
the
scientific
method

The
film
Urban
Legend
featured
students
discussing
popular
urban
legends
while
at
the
same
time
falling
victim
to
killings
re
enacting
them

The
film
The
Blair
Witch
Project
purposefully
positioned
itself
as
an
urban
legend
to
gain
viral
hype
and
succeeded
in
fooling
many
that
it
was
based
on
a
real
disappearance

The
lack
of
widespread
social
media
and
search
engines
helped
it
proliferate
in
the
months
leading
up
to
its
release

Between
and
The
Guardian
newspaper
Weekend
section
published
the
illustrated
Urban
Myths
column
by
Phil
Healey
and
Rick
Glanvill
with
content
taken
from
a
series
of
four
books
Urban
Myths
The
Return
of
Urban
Myths
Urban
Myths
Unplugged
and
Now
That
s
What
I
Call
Urban
Myths

The
comics
anthology
the
Big
Book
of
Urban
Legends
written
by
Robert
Boyd
Jan
Harold
Brunvand
and
Robert
Loren
Fleming
featured
urban
legends
displayed
as
comics

citation
needed
The
British
writer
Tony
Barrell
has
explored
urban
legends
in
a
long
running
column
in
The
Sunday
Times

These
include
the
story
that
Orson
Welles
began
work
on
a
Batman
movie
in
the
s
which
was
to
feature
James
Cagney
as
the
Riddler
and
Marlene
Dietrich
as
Catwoman
the
persistent
rumour
that
the
rock
singer
Courtney
Love
is
the
granddaughter
of
Marlon
Brando
and
the
idea
that
a
famous
s
poster
of
Farrah
Fawcett
contains
a
subliminal
sexual
message
concealed
in
the
actress
s
hair

Genres
edit
Crime
edit
As
with
traditional
urban
legends
many
internet
rumors
are
about
crimes
or
crime
waves
either
fictional
or
based
on
real
events
that
have
been
largely
exaggerated

Such
stories
can
be
problematic
both
because
they
purport
to
be
relevant
modern
news
and
because
they
do
not
follow
the
typical
patterns
of
urban
legends

Medicine
edit
Some
legends
are
medical
folklore
such
as
the
claim
that
eating
watermelon
seeds
will
result
in
a
watermelon
growing
in
the
stomach
or
that
going
outdoors
just
after
showering
will
result
in
catching
a
cold

Many
old
wives
tales
have
grown
around
the
identification
of
ailments
real
and
imagined
and
the
recommended
remedies
rituals
and
home
grown
medical
treatments
to
treat
them

citation
needed
Internet
edit
Internet
urban
legends
are
those
spread
through
the
internet
as
through
Usenet
or
email
or
more
recently
through
other
social
media

They
can
also
be
linked
to
viral
online
content

Some
take
the
form
of
chain
letters
and
spread
by
e
mail
directing
the
reader
to
share
them
or
to
meet
a
terrible
fate
and
following
a
recognizable
outline
of
hook
threat
and
finally
request

Paranormal
edit
Paranormal
urban
legend
stories
usually
involve
someone
encountering
something
supernatural
such
as
a
cryptid
for
instance
Bigfoot
or
Mothman
legendary
creatures
for
which
evidence
is
lacking
but
which
have
legions
of
believers

Research
shows
that
people
experiencing
sudden
or
surprising
events
such
as
a
Bigfoot
sighting
may
significantly
overestimate
the
duration
of
the
event

Marketing
edit
Companies
have
been
accused
of
hiding
secret
messages
behind
their
logos
or
packaging
as
in
the
case
of
the
old
Procter
Gamble
symbol
supposedly
an
occult
figure
that
gave
panache
to
the
brand

If
the
thirteen
stars
in
the
symbol
were
connected
a
certain
way
it
would
show
three
sixes
in
a
row
or
looked
at
the
curls
at
the
bottom
they
form
the
inverted
s

Similarly
a
video
of
a
Christian
woman
exposing
Monster
Energy
for
using
the
Hebrew
letter
vav
forming
the
letter
M
to
disguise
the
number
went
viral
on
Facebook
