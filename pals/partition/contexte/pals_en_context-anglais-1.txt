Urban
legend
Urban
legends
sometimes
modern
legend
urban
myth
or
simply
legend
is
a
genre
of
folklore
concerning
stories
about
an
unusual
usually
These
legends
can
be
entertaining
but
often
concern
mysterious
peril
or
troubling
events
such
as
disappearances
and
strange
objects
or
entities

Urban
legends
may
confirm
moral
standards
reflect
prejudices
or
be
a
way
to
make
sense
of
societal
anxieties

In
the
past
urban
legends
were
most
often
circulated
orally
at
gatherings
and
around
the
campfire
for
instance

Now
they
can
be
spread
by
any
media
including
newspapers
mobile
news
apps
e
mail
and
most
often
social
media

Some
urban
legends
have
passed
through
the
years
decades
with
only
minor
changes
in
where
the
time
period
takes
place

Generic
urban
legends
are
often
altered
to
suit
regional
variations
but
the
lesson
or
moral
generally
remains
the
same

The
term
urban
legend
as
used
by
folklorists
has
appeared
in
print
since
at
least
when
it
was
used
by
Richard
Dorson

Jan
Harold
the
term
to
the
general
public
in
a
series
of
popular
books
published
beginning
in


Brunvand
used
his
collection
of
legends
The
Vanishing
Hitchhiker
American
Urban
Legends
Their
Meanings
to
make
two
points
first
that
legends
and
folklore
do
not
occur
exclusively
in
so
called
primitive
or
traditional
societies
and
Many
urban
legends
are
framed
as
complete
stories
with
plot
and
characters

The
compelling
appeal
of
a
typical
urban
legend
is
its
elements
of
mystery
horror
fear
or
humor

Often
they
serve
as
cautionary
tales

Some
urban
legends
are
morality
tales
that
depict
someone
acting
in
a
disagreeable
manner
only
to
wind
up
in
trouble
Urban
legends
will
often
try
to
invoke
a
feeling
of
disgust
in
the
reader
which
tends
to
make
these
stories
more
memorable
and
potent

Elements
of
shock
value
can
be
found
in
almost
every
form
of
urban
legend
and
are
partially
what
makes
these
tales
so
impactful

An
urban
legend
may
include
elements
of
the
supernatural
or
paranormal

As
Jan
Brunvand
points
out
antecedent
legends
including
some
of
the
motifs
themes
and
symbolism
of
the
urtexts
can
readily
be
possible
origin
of
The
Hook
in
the
series
of
Lovers
Lane
murders
in
Texarkana
Texas
United
States

The
urban
legend
that
Coca
Cola
developed
the
drink
Fanta
to
sell
in
Nazi
Germany
The
narrator
of
an
urban
legend
may
claim
it
happened
to
a
friend
or
to
a
friend
of
a
friend
which
serves
to
personalize
authenticate
and
enhance
the
power
of
the
narrative
while
distancing
the
teller
from
the
tall
tale

Many
urban
legends
depict
horrific
crimes
contaminated
foods
or
other
situations
that
would
potentially
affect
new
gang
member
would
have
to
murder
the
citizen
as
a
requirement
of
initiation

A
fax
retelling
this
legend
received
at
the
Nassau
County
Florida
fire
department
was
forwarded
to
police
and
from
Urban
legends
typically
include
common
elements
the
tale
is
retold
on
behalf
of
the
original
witness
or
participant
dire
warnings
are
often
identified
by
first
name
only
or
not
identified
at
all

Such
legends
seem
to
be
believable
and
even
provocative
as
some
readers
are
led
in
turn
to
pass
them
on
including
on
social
media
platforms
that
Persistent
urban
legends
do
often
maintain
a
degree
of
plausibility
as
in
the
story
a
serial
killer
deliberately
hiding
in
the
back
seat
of
a
because
of
details
within
its
th
century
trademark

The
legend
interrupted
the
company
s
business
to
the
point
that
it
stopped
using
the
trademark

at
authentication

The
coinage
leads
in
turn
to
the
terms
FOAFlore
and
FOAFtale


While
at
least
one
classic
legend
the
Death
Car
has
been
shown
to
have
some
basis
in
fact
Social
scientists
have
started
to
draw
on
urban
legends
in
order
to
help
explain
complex
socio
psychological
beliefs
such
as
attitudes
to
crime
childcare
fast
food
SUVs
and
other
family
choices

The
authors
make
an
explicit
connection
between
urban
legends
and
popular
folklore
such
as
Grimm
s
Fairy
Tales
where
similar
themes
and
motifs
The
Internet
has
made
it
easier
both
to
spread
and
to
debunk
urban
legends

For
instance
the
Usenet
newsgroup
alt
folklore
urban
and
several
other
websites
most
notably
snopes
com
focus
on
discussing
tracking
and
analyzing
urban
legends

The
United
States
Department
of
Energy
had
a
now
discontinued
service
called
Hoaxbusters
that
dealt
with
computer
distributed
hoaxes
and
legends

The
most
notable
such
hoaxes
are
known
as
creepypastas
which
are
typically
horror
stories
written
anonymously

Although
most
Television
shows
such
as
Urban
Legends
Beyond
Belief
Fact
or
Fiction
and
later
Mostly
True
Stories
Urban
Legends
Revealed
feature
re
enactments
of
urban
legends
detailing
the
accounts
of
the
tales
and
typically
later
in
an
episode
revealing
any
factual
basis
they
may
have

The
Discovery
Channel
TV
show
MythBusters
tried
to
prove
or
disprove
several
urban
legends
by
attempting
to
reproduce
them
using
the
scientific
method

The
film
Urban
Legend
featured
students
discussing
popular
urban
legends
while
at
the
same
time
falling
victim
to
killings
re
enacting
them

The
film
The
Blair
Witch
Project
purposefully
positioned
itself
as
an
urban
legend
to
gain
viral
hype
and
succeeded
in
fooling
many
that
it
was
based
on
a
real
disappearance
