Legend
Urban
Legend
was
a
teen
horror
movie
set
at
the
fictional
Pendleton
University
where
a
rash
of
murders
are
being
committed
years
after
the
campus
was
the
site
of
a
massacre

The
bizarre
murders
all
resemble
different
urban
legends

Early
in
the
movie
Natalie
Alicia
Witt
and
Brenda
Rebecca
Gayheart
talk
about
the
legend
of
the
Stanley
Hall
massacre
and
dare
one
another
to
stand
in
the
doorway
under
the
arch
on
the
Urban

Frat
party
pn
Hospital
today
known
as
Cumberland
House
served
as
the
fraternity
house
in
Urban
Legend
where
a
Halloween
party
is
held

Urban
Legend
was
released
only
two
years
after
the
first
of
the
Scream
trilogy
films
and
received
much
negative
criticism
when
the
two
were
and
find
themselves
at
the
center
of
a
series
of
bizarre
murders

Like
its
counterpart
Urban
Legend
did
not
hesitate
to
poke
fun
at
itself
Just
prior
to
his
death
Damon
Joshua
Jackson
turns
on
the
radio
in
the
car
At
the
end
of
the
film
a
group
of
students
sit
around
talking
about
the
murders
and
debate
whether
or
not
they
are
an
urban
legend

One
of
the
students
jokingly
says
that
they
bet
Brenda
was
the
girl
from
the
Noxzema
