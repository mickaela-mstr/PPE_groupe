Tom
Hardy
s
once
derided
Kray
Twins
film
Legend
is
having
its
day
in
the
sun
on
Netflix
Legend
now
sat
at
the
top
spot
on
Netflix
in
the
UK
famously
wedged
a
two
star
Guardian
review
between
Tom
Hardy
s
Kray
twins
on
its
Legend
isn
t
a
good
movie

Structurally
it
s
drab
and
conventional
an
elliptical
chronology
of
Kray
moments
loosely
knitted
together
by
the
this
in
interviews
to
be
fair
in
a
Wired
video
he
described
himself
as
a
bourgeois
posh
middle
class
twat
but
Legend
isn
t
simply
a
case
of
Hardy
falling
back
into
the
working
class
rhythms
of
his
youth

Hardy
cultivated
consciously
or
not
a
rough
n
rugged
loveable
bad
boy
image
Legend
being
the
arguable
apex

Seven
years
on
with
Legend
enjoying
something
of
a
resurgence
vis
a
vis
Netflix
you
d
better
believe
there
s
only
one
reason
people
Legend
is
now
streaming
on
Netflix
UK
