An
Overview
of
Master
Legend
position
as
we
descend
into
our
all
night
tour
of
Fist
City
and
it
s
most
famous
resident
MASTER
LEGEND
The
article
The
Legend
of
Master
Legend
written
by
Joshuah
Bearman
and
appearing
in
the
January
edition
of
Rolling
Stone
was
my
and
very
different
e
mails

One
was
from
someone
telling
me
what
a
great
awesome
guy
Master
Legend
was
and
that
I
should
get
in
contact
with
him

A
second
e
mail
told
me
that
Master
Legend
was
a
nutjob
and
they
were
sick
of
writers
using
him
as
a
representative
of
the
RLSH
repeatedly
during
my
course
of
writing
about
RLSH

PRO
LEGEND
Tales
of
Comic
Book
Bravado
and
Crimefighting
Something
that
appeals
to
some
RLSH
about
Master
Legend
is
that
he
is
very
dynamic
and
energetic

He
is
often
documented
running
jumping
wild
action
packed
and
never
a
snoozefest

Some
of
them
are
fantastic
and
we
must
take
them
at
Master
Legend
s
word
since
the
only
witnesses
are
Master
Legend
himself
and
the
claimed
league
of
frightened
criminals
who
have
had
the
misfortune
of
it

This
guy
known
as
Big
Red
has
been
terrorizing
my
homeless
friends
but
now
it
s
time
to
meet
the
Legend

This
guy
has
tried
to
evade
me
because
he
knows
of
the
whispered
tales
behind
shuttered
doors
of
Master
Legend

He
has
a
few
punks
that
do
crack
friends
so
I
got
Brimstone
to
come
along
for
been
running
his
mouth
out
in
the
streets
saying
he
can
kick
Master
Legend
s
ass

I
tell
you
this
he
will
need
more
Cheerios
then
the
universe
has

work
together
we
can

Legend

June
MySpace
blog
It
s
a
good
story
I
see
why
people
would
like
it

An
evildoer
is
threatening
the
homeless
Master
Legend
shows
up
and
scares
him
off
then
parts
with
some
good
advice

If
Big
Red
was
hassling
my
homeless
kick
his
ass
too

Big
Red
if
you
re
reading
this
Fist
City

Master
Legend
s
energy
and
his
war
stories
are
contagious
and
has
won
him
RLSH
and
non
RLSH
fans
alike

Acting
as
a
Media
Ambassador
Besides
the
Rolling
Stone
article
mentioned
Master
Legend
has
attracted
media
attention
from
around
the
world
and
for
many
some
kind
and
strangely
has
even
had
talks
about
his
own
cooking
show
Some
RLSH
say
this
media
attention
is
not
just
good
for
Master
Legend
but
good
for
RLSH
in
general

Not
only
that
but
Master
Legend
runs
his
own
RLSH
forum
leading
a
platoon
at
the
Master
Legend
Army
and
recently
began
his
own
internet
radio
entry
The
Master
Legend
Show

Can
Shred
on
Guitar
One
of
America
s
great
exports
besides
comic
book
superheroes
is
rock
n
roll
and
Master
Legend
likes
to
shred
on
the
guitar
as
evidenced
by
video
showing
him
performing
with
the
band
Alias
Punch
as
well
as
his
own
musical
projects

Master
Legend
tells
me
his
favorite
guitar
players
are
Randy
California
Spirit
also
played
with
Jimmy
Hendrix
Recognition
From
Local
Law
Enforcement
In
The
Legend
of
Master
Legend
Joshuah
Bearman
reports
that
he
got
in
touch
with
a
local
police
Sergeant
who
spoke
favorably
of
Master
Legend

The
Sergeant
who
s
in
charge
of
vice
investigations
took
a
chance
and
tracked
Master
Legend
down

Based
on
the
neighborhood
he
figured
Master
Legend
might
be
a
good
local
contact

And
sure
enough
the
Sergeant
tells
me
I
start
getting
calls
from
Master
Legend
with
information

And
it
checks
out

Master
Legend
has
helped
put
away
a
few
criminals

Additionally
a
photo
on
MySpace
shows
Master
Legend
receiving
a
certificate
of
recognition
from
a
police
officer

ALSO
ADDED
RLSHs
tell
me
that
Master
Legend
helped
Florida
residents
in
the
aftermath
of
Hurricane
Charly
He
helped
cut
apart
trees
on
people
out
of
their
houses
who
were
trapped

ANTI
LEGEND
Tales
of
Comic
Book
Bravado
and
Crimefighting
The
very
thing
that
appeals
to
some
people
about
Master
Legend
is
what
others
use
as
a
criticism
his
storytelling

Many
of
his
claims
have
no
For
example
in
his
article
Joshuah
Bearman
writes
about
how
Master
legend
and
Justice
Force
a
pre
Team
Justice
had
a
mission
to
put
the
stomp
on
a
child
molester
and
his
gang
of
crackheads

Master
Legend
has
many
more
florid
tales
of
adventure
some
plausible
like
retrieving
a
friend
s
stolen
money
others
quite
bidding

In
another
blog
entry
Master
Legend
himself
describes
a
confrontation
he
has
in
an
alleyway
with
three
criminals
he
encounters
while
give
a
then
take
off
my
helmet
and
bash
him
in
the
head
with
it
by
this
time
they
hear
the
Legend
yell
as
I
go
into
Fist
City
mode

The
one
guy
s
head
is
bleeding
and
he
staggers
off
as
the
other
two
are
He
goes
on
to
say
that
he
flees
the
scene
when
someone
comes
across
it
and
says
they
are
calling
the
cops

Master
Legend
says
call
them
and
gives
the
person
his
card
before
heading
to
a
pizza
joint
and
ordering
up
the
good
work

So
Master
Legend
triumphs
over
three
armed
street
hoods
using
his
WWII
helmet
and
habanero
pepper
he
has
tucked
in
his
utility
belt

Do
I
have
Claims
of
Metaphysical
and
Religious
Powers
Master
Legend
has
claimed
to
have
various
metaphysical
and
voodoo
based
powers

In
January
Master
Legend
posted
a
message
that
he
was
the
archangel
Metatron

It
first
appeared
at
the
Heroes
Network
which
led
Anti
Homosexual
Comments
Master
Legend
has
received
some
controversy
from
statements
he
s
made
regarding
homosexuals

For
instance
on
March
Atavistik
a
RLSH
California
meet
up
for
San
Francisco
s
Gay
Pride
Fest

Master
Legend
responded
to
the
thread
Allegations
of
Alcohol
Abuse
By
this
I
m
not
talking
about
the
fact
the
Master
Legend
drinks
in
the
comfort
of
Legend
Tower

Many
people
of
all
professions
drink
police
officers
doctors
ditch
diggers
even
RLSH
bloggers

The
allegations
I
am
talking
about
are
Master
Legend
drinking
and
then
going
on
patrol
or
driving
the
Justice
Van
