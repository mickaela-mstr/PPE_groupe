urban
legends
have
always
been
whispered
to
us

From
a
young
age
we
have
been
told
stories
babysitter
and
hundreds
of
other
stories
that
make
our
skin
crawl

Urban
legends
surround
us
and
they
can
be
anything
from
tales
told
on
the
school
bus
to
internet
stories

But
why
much
The
term
urban
legend
has
been
popular
since
the
s
when
Jan
Harold
Brunvand
published
his
collection
of
urban
legends
and
their
meanings

When
discussing
the
story
of
the
vanishing
hitchhiker
Harold
wrote
that
the
legend
had
evolved
from
older
European
stories
about
travelers
riding
horseback

With
and
wide
spreading
by
word
of
mouth
to
ears
all
around

Urban
legends
typically
grow
popular
through
storytelling

The
speaker
usually
claims
that
such
things
happened
to
a
friend
Because
why
would
a
friend
lie
The
peculiarities
and
suspense
of
an
urban
legend
are
what
makes
them
spread

The
more
shocking
yet
realistic
the
story
the
more
we
want
to
share
it

Sometimes
urban
legends
are
told
to
extend
caution
and
sometimes
most
times
they
are
simply
good
stories

Nowadays
instant
communication
has
made
it
easier
for
urban
legends
to
spread

For
a
long
time
urban
legend
email
chains
were
popular
and
now
such
tales
are
told
on
social
media
with
a
their
feeds

What
makes
urban
legends
so
captivating
is
that
they
contain
elements
from
everyday
life
such
as
walking
through
the
possibility
that
ordinary
things
could
expose
us
to
the
terrors
these
legends
speak
of

As
time
passes
urban
legends
shift
retelling
a
modernized
version
of
the
story
to
newer
audiences
making
urban
legends
everlasting

Some
stories
we
take
more
seriously
than
others
because
apart
from
entertainment
urban
legends
allow
us
to
spread
awareness
and
preach
caution
about
the
dangers
hidden
in
everyday
life

But
there
have
been
times
when
urban
legends
have
been
taken
too
seriously

In
two
girls
attempted
to
brutally
murder
their
best
friend
because
of
the
urban
legend
of
the
Slender
Man

The
first
time
the
name
touched
screens
was
in
when
two
It
is
important
to
be
cautious
when
spreading
stories
especially
among
children

Because
urban
legends
like
this
one
can
quickly
unfold
into
more
elaborate
creative
stories
our
not
susceptible
to
becoming
violent
because
of
a
story
urban
legends
can
trigger
deep
dark
fears
impacting
us
deeply
and
oftentimes
making
us
paranoid

Most
people
have
been
impacted
by
urban
legends
in
one
way
or
another
whether
that
be
hearing
a
story
and
sharing
it
with
a
friend
or
stumbling
upon
a
Creepypasta
and
not
being
able
to
sleep
in
the
dark
for
days

Urban
legends
are
not
typical
scary
stories
they
are
spread
with
the
notion
that
they
are
true
and
that
they
are
something
we
should
beware
of

Urban
legends
must
be
spread
with
warning
as
they
can
unravel
more
than
we
know

Urban
legends
can
form
innocently
sometimes
with
the
simple
intention
of
amusing
friends
and
sometimes
with
the
intention
of
evoking
harmless
fear

But
as
humans
we
have
a
knack
for
taking
scary
stories
and
legends
too
seriously

Do
not
believe
everything
you
hear
and
remember
to
spread
stories

Creepypasta
