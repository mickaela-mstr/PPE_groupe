Rural
legends

Examples
informative
and
useful
to
come
up
with
a
list
and
or
discuss
what
JB
has
called
rural
legends

These
would
be
similar
to
the
well
known
term
urban
legends
but
they
would
be
much
more
common
in
rural
areas
and
deal
with
the
outdoors
wildlife
hunting
and
fishing
farming
more
important
A
rural
legend
would
be
a
sub
class
of
urban
legends
according
the
the
Wikipedia
article
on
urban
legends

Despite
its
name
a
typical
urban
legend
does
not
necessarily
originate
in
an
urban
setting

The
term
is
simply
used
to
differentiate
modern
legend
from
traditional
folklore
in
preindustrial
times

For
this
reason
sociologists
and
folklorists
prefer
the
term
contemporary
legend

Urban
and
rural
legends
are
not
the
same
as
myths
but
they
are
related

Once
again
from
the
Wikipedia
coinage
leads
in
turn
to
the
terms
FOAFlore
and
FOAFtale


While
at
least
one
classic
legend
the
Death
Car
has
been
shown
to
have
some
basis
in
fact
folklorists
as
such
are
interested
in
debunking

Ralph
that
is
a
good
one



I
hope
it
was
true
The
legends
I
have
heard
from
around
here
are
the
same
ones
you
always
hear
Hal
and
JB
nailed
it

The
legend
of
the
introduced
insatiable
omnipotent
Canadian
Wolf
has
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
tales
ever
told

The
gist
being
recognize
or
have
ever
recognized
international
borders
If
you
believe
this
legend
then
you
believe
that
wolves
in
Idaho
did
not
historically
intermingle
with
wolves
in
Canada

Ever

August
Changing
the
subject
from
wolves
there
is
legend
that
the
grazing
of
the
rangelands
has
been
neatly
effectively
replaced
by
grazing

Ralph
did
you
mean
to
say
there
is
legend
that
the
grazing
of
the
rangelands
by
buffalo
has
been

effectively
replaced
by
Please
note
my
addition
to
the
original
post

For
some
help
about
the
nature
of
urban
and
so
rural
legends
the
Wikipedia
article
about
urban
legends
is
useful
