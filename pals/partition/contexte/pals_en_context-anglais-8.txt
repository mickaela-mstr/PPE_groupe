This

leading

is
linked
to
several
urban
legends
but
one
of
the
most
prominent
is
the
Japanese
kuchisake
onna
Slit
Mouthed
Woman
legend
where
a
vengeful
female
spirit
appears
with
a
disfigured
face
and
asks
potential
victims
if
they
find
her
beautiful

Depending
on
their
answer
she
either
kills
them
or

them

The

urban
legend
plays
on
the
broader
concept
of

The

This
movie
wasn
t
based
on
an
urban
legend
per
se
but
it
used
the
idea
of
urban
legends
and
folklore
to
scare
viewers

Also
The
filmmakers
created
and
disseminated
a
fictional
urban
legend
of
their
own
to
promote
the
film
of
course

Early
internet
culture
helped
to
make
their
fictional
legend
seem
real
the
filmmakers
created
a
website
that
presented
the
Blair
Witch
story
as
genuine
folklore
complete
with
how
quaint
to
imagine
this
in
modern

smartly
mimicked
the
way
urban
legends
spread
in
the
modern
age
using
the
internet
as
a
new
medium
for
word
of
mouth

The
legend
in
the
movie
was
designed
to
feel
like
an
authentic
ancient
myth
and
the
film
cleverly
presents
it
as
Mike

into
the
woods
near
Burkittsville
Maryland
in
to
make
a
documentary
about
the
Blair
Witch
legend

Witch
Project
the
Blair
Witch
is
a
vengeful
spirit
tied
to
the
town
of
Burkittsville
formerly
called
Blair


The
legend
spans
centuries
beginning
with
the
story
of
Elly
Kedward
a
woman
accused
of
witchcraft
to
vanish
and
the
remaining
villagers
abandoned
Blair
convinced
that
the
area
was
cursed

The
legend
suggests
that
Kedward
s
spirit
known
as
the
Blair
Witch
haunted
the
woods
around
Burkittsville
causing
mysterious
disappearances
and
deaths
over
the
years

The
legend
goes
further
citing
the
abduction
of
a
group
of
children
in
the
s
by
a

fake
documentary
style
movie
and
it
even
fooled

Finally
the
horror
film
Urban
Legend
illustrates
exactly
why
urban
legends
are
excellent
fodder
for
a
scary
movie

Set
on
a
college
campus
a
series
of
gruesome
student
murders
start
happening
and
they
seem
to
reflect
commonly
known
urban
legends

Indeed
the
killer
in
the
film
uses
these
legends
as
inspiration
for
creative
killings
and
the
plot
heavily
relies
on
the
audience
recognizing
these
myths

Among
the
common
urban
legends
depicted
are

The
film
helps
perpetuate
these
urban

fears
and
that
of
course
makes
it
easier
to
build
a
franchise
of
sequels
But
