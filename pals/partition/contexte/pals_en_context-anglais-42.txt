In
nearly
every
The
Legend
of
Zelda
video
game
we
explore
a
vast
landscape
usually
called
Hyrule
and
yet
no
two
Hyrules
are
ever
documentation
of
this
magical
land

In
the
instruction
manual
for
The
Legend
of
Zelda
it
indicates
that
this
game
takes
place
in
a
little
kingdom
in
the
land
of
Hyrule

As
we
discover
in
the
direct
sequel
the
vast
landscape
we
traversed
in
the
first
game

Clearly
we
are
to
believe
that
Hyrule
as
we
knew
it
in
The
Legend
of
Zelda
is
but
one
tiny
piece
of
a
grand
land

actually
takes
place
within
the
same
vague
area
of
Hyrule
seen
in
The
Legend
of
Zelda

In
each
Zelda
video
game
we
are
provided
with
two
important
documents
a
legend
regarding
the
history
preceding
the
story
of
the
game
usually
entitled
Story
and
a
rough
map
of
the
geography
that
Link
will
Take
for
instance
the
original
The
Legend
of
Zelda
in
the
instruction
manual
we
are
presented
with
a
highly
detailed
clay
The
Legend
of
Zelda
s
Hyrule
Are
we
then
to
believe
that
The
Legend
of
Zelda
s
blocky
clay
map
of
Hyrule
is
more
accurate
than
Ocarina
s
merely
because
it
better
matches
exist
as
a
landscape

We
must
then
assume
that
Hyrule
as
depicted
in
The
Legend
of
Zelda
is
an
impression
only

If
we
take
both
the
instruction
manual
map
and
in
game
landscape
as
impressionistic
for
The
Legend
of
Zelda
why
then
should
we
take
any
other
representation
of
Hyrule
any
more
literally
The
majority
of
the
Zelda
games
take
place
in
the
region
I
term
Southern
Hyrule
