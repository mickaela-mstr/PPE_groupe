A
legend
is
a
genre
of
folklore
that
consists
of
a
narrative
featuring
human
actions
believed
or
perceived
to
have
taken
place
in
human
history

Narratives
in
this
genre
may
demonstrate
human
values
and
possess
certain
qualities
that
give
the
tale
verisimilitude

Legend
for
its
active
and
passive
participants
may
include
miracles

Legends
may
be
transformed
over
time
to
keep
them
fresh
and
vital

Many
legends
operate
within
the
realm
of
uncertainty
never
being
entirely
believed
by
the
participants
but
also
never
being
resolutely
doubted

Legends
are
sometimes
distinguished
from
myths
in
that
they
concern
human
beings
as
the
main
characters
and
do
not
necessarily

myths
generally
do

A

the
concern
with
human
beings
is
the
long
list
of
legendary
creatures
leaving
no
resolute
doubt
that
legends
are
historically
grounded

A
modern
folklorist
s
professional
definition
of

was
proposed
by
Timothy

in

Legend
is
a
loanword
from
Old
French
that
entered
English
usage
c



The
Old
French
noun
legende
derives
from
the
Medieval
Latin
introduced
in
the
s
meaning
a
collection
or
corpus
of
legends

This
word
changed
to
legendry
and
legendary
became
the
adjectival
form

acknowledged
in
John
Foxe
s
Actes
and
Monuments
was
fictitious

Thus
legend
gained
its
modern
connotations
of
undocumented
and
spurious
which
distinguish
it
from
the
meaning
of
chronicle

In
Jacob
Grimm
described
the
fairy
tale
as
poetic

Questions
of
categorising
legends
in
hopes
of
compiling

based
series
of

on
the
line
of
the
Aarne
Thompson
folktale
index
provoked
a
search
for
a
questions
operative
in
examining
folk
tales
Friedrich
Ranke
de
in
characterised
the
folk
legend
as
a
popular
narrative
with
an
objectively
untrue
imaginary
content
a
dismissive
position
that
was
Compared
to
the
highly
structured
folktale
legend
is
comparatively
amorphous
Helmut
de
Boor
noted
in


The
narrative
content
of
legend
is
in
realistic
mode
rather
than
the
wry
irony
of
folktale
Wilhelm
Heiske
remarked
on
the
similarity
of
motifs
in
legend
and
folktale
and
concluded
that
in
spite
of
its
realistic
mode
legend
is
not
more
historical
than
folktale

In
Einleitung
in
der
Geschichtswissenschaft
Ernst
Bernheim
asserted
that
a
legend
is
simply
a
longstanding
rumour

Gordon
Allport
credited
the
staying
power
of
some
rumours
to
the
persistent
cultural
state
of
mind
that
they
embody
and
capsulise
thus
Urban
legends
are
a
feature
of
rumour

When
Willian
Hugh
Jansen
suggested
that
legends
that
disappear
quickly
were
short
term
legends
and
the
persistent
ones
be
termed
long
term
legends
the
distinction
between
legend
and
rumour
was
effectively
obliterated
Tangherlini
concluded

legendary

Because
saints
lives
are
often
included
in
many
miracle
stories
legend
in
a
wider
sense
came
to
refer
to
any
story
that
