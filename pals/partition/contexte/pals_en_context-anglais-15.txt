Beloved
by
generations
of
readers
Washington
Irving
s
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollow
ranks
among
the
classics
of
American
literature

The
Story
Legend
possesses
elements
of
a
thriller
but
at
the
heart
of
the
tale
is
a
love
triangle
set
in
Sleepy
Hollow
on
the
shore
of
the
Hudson
Irving
s
inspirations
Irving
wrote
Legend
while
living
in
England

Some
scholars
suggest
Irving
s
tale
may
have
been
inspired
by
folk
stories
he
heard
during
shabby
gentlemanly
old
fellow
some
years
earlier

These
layers
of
authorship
remind
readers
of
the
essential
nature
of
a
legend
a
story
told
and
retold
by
tradition
and
no
longer
verifiable

Critical
Success
Legend
formed
part
of

Geoffrey
Crayon

Irving
and
published
in
installments
in
and
Sunnyside
make
improvements
to
the
property
and
help
his
family
members
financially

Legend
has
never
been
out
of
print
since
it
first
was
published

Irving
wrote
many
other
works
but
arguably
Legend
remains
the
most
popular
perhaps
because
fans
of
the
story
love
to
be
a
bit
frightened
