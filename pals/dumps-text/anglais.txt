You
know
The
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollow
from
the
countless
movies
cartoons
and
other
adaptations

The
tale
of
Rip
Van
Winkle
is
thoroughly
ingrained
in
American
culture

But
how
about
the
man
behind
the
stories
As
it
turns
out
Washington
Irving
s
life
was
just
as
interesting
as
the
books
he
wrote

Here
are
things
you
might
not
know
about
America
s
first
international
best
selling
author



Irving
was
the
last
of
children
eight
of
whom
lived
into
adulthood

His
older
brothers
often
supported
him
as
he
pursued
his
writing
interests
and
he
started
the
literary
magazine
Salmagundi
with
his
brother
William



He
was
named
after
George
Washington

Irving
was
born
in
the
same
year
the
American
Revolution
came
to
an
end

He
was
named
after
the
war
hero
and
attended
Washington
s
inauguration
when
he
was
years
old

In
fact
historians
think
that
Irving
s
account
of
Washington
s
swearing
in
created
the
now
challenged
story
that
Washington
added
So
help
me
God
to
his
oath
of
office



In
yellow
fever
had
reached
epidemic
proportions
in
New
York
with
over
deaths

Fear
of
the
disease
drove
the
family
to
send
Irving
to
stay
with
a
friend
in
Tarrytown

It
was
here
that
he
would
have
gotten
to
know
Sleepy
Hollow
which
was
to
become
the
setting
of
course
of
his
most
famous
story
The
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollow



As
a
reporter
for
his
brother
Peter
s
newspaper
The
Morning
Chronicle
Irving
covered
Aaron
Burr
s
treason
trial

He
described
the
courtroom
meeting
of
Burr
and
his
adversary
General
James
Wilkinson
saying
Burr
turned
his
head
looked
him
full
in
the
face
with
one
of
his
piercing
regards
swept
his
eye
over
his
whole
person
from
head
to
foot
as
if
to
scan
his
dimensions
then
coolly
resumed
his
former
position



He
was
engaged
to
Matilda
Hoffman
in
but
she
died
of
tuberculosis
before
they
were
wed

Irving
was
devastated
and
never
married

Years
later
he
wrote
to
a
friend
about
her
death
saying
For
years
I
could
not
talk
on
the
subject
of
this
hopeless
regret
I
could
not
even
mention
her
name
but
her
image
was
continually
before
me
and
I
dreamt
of
her
incessantly



Irving
not
only
coined
the
word
Gotham
as
a
nickname
for
New
York
City
he
also
helped
establish
the
use
of
knickerbocker
as
a
name
for
New
Yorkers

Gotham
was
the
name
of
the
city
lampooned
in
stories
is
his
literary
magazine

Knickerbocker
was
adapted
from
his
book
A
History
of
New
York
From
the
Beginning
of
the
World
to
the
End
of
the
Dutch
Dynasty
by
Diederich
Knickerbocker

Irving
was
also
the
origin
of
the
phrase
the
almighty
dollar
having
written
in
The
Creole
Village
The
almighty
dollar
that
great
object
of
universal
devotion
throughout
our
land
seems
to
have
no
genuine
devotees
in
these
peculiar
villages
and
unless
some
of
its
missionaries
penetrate
there
and
erect
banking
houses
and
other
pious
shrines
there
is
no
knowing
how
long
the
inhabitants
may
remain
in
their
present
state
of
contented
poverty



It
wouldn
t
be
a
very
merry
Christmas
without
Irving

In
a
time
when
Christmas
wasn
t
widely
celebrated
Irving
helped
create
the
modern
image
of
Santa
Claus
in
A
History
of
New
York

He
wrote
about
a
man
who
dreamt
that
the
good
St

Nicholas
came
riding
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
in
that
self
same
wagon
wherein
he
brings
his
yearly
presents
to
children

He
continued
to
foster
the
Christmas
tradition
in
The
Sketch
Book
of
Geoffrey
Crayon
Gent

with
stories
like
Christmas
Eve
which
describes
the
then
little
known
tradition
of
hanging
mistletoe



Irving
also
had
a
hand
in
inventing
the
myth
that
people
in
the
Middle
Ages
thought
the
world
was
flat

In
Irving
s
book
A
History
of
the
Life
and
Voyages
of
Christopher
Columbus
he
fictionalizes
the
meeting
of
the
Spanish
commission
that
examines
Columbus
expedition
plan
with
members
of
the
committee
raising
objections
to
the
idea
that
world
was
round

Readers
accepted
Irving
s
version
as
truth
but
in
reality
the
educated
class
would
have
long
accepted
the
idea
of
a
round
earth



He
bought
his
riverside
home
Sunnyside
in
for
and
he
died
of
a
heart
attack
in
his
bedroom
in


The
home
was
quite
the
tourist
attraction
with
Oliver
Wendell
Holmes
Sr

writing
that
Sunnyside
was
next
to
Mount
Vernon
the
best
known
and
most
cherished
of
all
the
dwellings
in
our
land



In
Irving
was
the
first
author
to
be
featured
on
the
Famous
Americans
series
stamps

Other
authors
included
in
the
series
were
James
Fenimore
Cooper
Ralph
Waldo
Emerson
Louisa
May
Alcott
and
Samuel
Clemens

We
all
know
that
the
Slender
Man
is
nothing
more
than
a
pure
urban
legend
created
online
in
on
an
Internet
forum

However
since
then
it
has
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own
even
being
connected
with
several
attempted
murders
as
well
as
a
spate
of
suicides
and
a
possible
mass
suicide
attempt

While
nobody
is
arguing
that
the
Slender
Man
is
real
at
least
in
the
physical
sense
the
belief
in
him
by
some
has
made
the
consequences
of
the
legend
very
real
for
some

Here
are
ten
very
unsettling
points
about
the
legend
and
reality
of
the
Slender
Man

Unlike
many
other
legends
and
myths
the
origins
of
the
Slender
Man
can
be
traced
to
the
exact
date
of
its
creation

At
some
point
on
June
the
Internet
forum
Something
Awful
unleashed
two
photographs

They
were
created
by
user
Victor
Surge
whose
real
name
was
eventually
revealed
to
be
Eric
Knudsen


He
had
created
them
in
response
to
a
challenge
by
the
forum
s
admin
to
create
paranormal
images
that
might
make
people
believe
they
were
genuine

The
first
picture
dating
from
showed
a
group
of
children
looking
upset
and
frightened

In
the
background
is
a
discreet
extraordinarily
tall
faceless
man

The
caption
read
We
didn
t
want
to
go
we
didn
t
want
to
kill
them
but
its
persistent
silence
and
outstretched
arms
horrified
us
and
comforted
us
at
the
same
time
That
quote
was
attributed
to
the
unknown
photographer
who
was
presumed
dead

The
second
picture
was
dated
three
years
later
in


It
showed
children
looking
altogether
happier
while
playing
in
a
park

Discreetly
though
the
same
tall
figure
can
be
seen
lurking
in
the
background

The
caption
informed
those
who
viewed
the
picture
that
it
was
one
of
two
recovered
photographs
from
the
Stirling
City
Library
blaze

It
also
stated
that
the
photo
was
taken
the
day
which
fourteen
children
vanished
and
even
referenced
Slender
Man

This
time
the
photographer
was
named
as
Mary
Thomas
who
had
been
missing
since
June


These
two
pictures
not
only
gave
birth
to
the
Slender
Man
legends
but
they
also
captivated
thousands
upon
thousands
of
people
almost
immediately

Although
Knudsen
was
responsible
for
the
Slender
Man
s
creation
it
would
be
the
many
followers
of
Creepypasta
who
would
truly
bring
him
to
life

As
more
and
more
people
became
aware
of
Slender
Man
and
added
their
own
details
and
little
pieces
of
the
backstory
the
legend
grew

He
was
often
depicted
with
a
white
featureless
face
and
was
slim
abnormally
tall
and
often
with
tentacles
coming
from
his
back

He
also
became
associated
with
abandoned
buildings
often
in
the
wilderness
or
the
woods

Some
details
added
later
even
claimed
that
the
Slender
Man
could
teleport
from
one
place
to
another

Those
who
were
interested
in
the
Slender
Man
even
agreed
signs
that
he
was
near
and
watching
you

Such
signs
as
sudden
paranoia
nosebleeds
and
intense
nightmares

In
fact
this
creation
of
a
legend
by
the
audience
themselves
is
the
subject
of
our
next
point

How
this
growth
can
be
monitored
and
studied
by
those
who
study
myths
and
folklore
of
the
past

Many
who
study
legends
folklore
and
mythology
have
looked
at
the
Slender
Man
legends
as
a
way
of
being
able
to
document
its
growth
and
reach

And
in
doing
so
they
look
to
understand
how
legends
of
the
past
might
have
developed
and
grown
in
a
similar
way

For
example
there
is
a
collective
element
to
the
growth
of
the
Slender
Man
legend
as
we
examined
above

What
s
more
slight
details
change
depending
on
who
is
telling
the
tale
or
who
the
audience
might
be

Indeed
the
more
accounts
that
were
retold
of
the
Slender
Man
online
as
opposed
to
orally
in
this
case
the
more
the
legend
and
the
backstory
grew

The
Slender
Man
legend
had
very
quickly
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own
much
like
myths
and
folklore
of
the
past

However
several
years
after
his
creation
the
Slender
Man
became
real
in
a
much
grittier
way

On
May
the
Slender
Man
or
at
least
the
consequences
of
the
legend
spilled
over
into
the
real
world
in
a
very
dramatic
way

On
the
morning
in

two
year
old
girls
Anissa
Weier
and
Morgan
Geyser
attempted
to
murder
their
friend
Payton
Leutner
by
stabbing
her
multiple
times
in

being
left
for
dead
she
eventually
stumbled
out
and
was
discovered
by
a
passing
cyclist

The
girls
were
arrested
a
short
time
later

When
questioned
Weier
claimed
they
had
launched
the
attack
in
order
to
please
the
Slender
Man

What
s
more
they
also
believed
they
knew
where
the
Slender
Man
lived
an
old
house
in
the
Nicolet
National
Forest
a
location
they
were
on
their
way
to
when
they
were
arrested

For
all
intents
and
purposes
it
could
be
argued
that
for
the
attackers
and
their
victim
alike
the
Slender
Man
or
the
consequences
of
him
were
very
real

Incidentally
Weier
was
released
from
a
mental
health
facility
in

summer
of

Following
the
attempted
murder
of
Payton
Leutner
several
copycat
cases
occurred
all
with
various
connections
to
the
Slender
Man
legends

For
example
only
weeks
later
in
June
in
Hamilton
County
Ohio
a
year
old
girl
attacked
her
mother
with
a
knife

In
the
investigation
that
followed
it
was
discovered
that
she
had
an
obsession
with
the
Slender
Man

Several
months
after
that
in
September
in
Port
Richey
Florida
a
year
old
girl
set
fire
to
her
family
home

According
to
reports
she
was
inspired
by
the
Slender
Man
to
do
so

Incidentally
all
of
those
inside
escaped
the
burning
building
and
the
young
girl
was
arrested
the
following
morning

Even
the
murders
of
two
police
officers
and
a
member
of
the
public
in
Las
Vegas
in
the
summer
of
followed
by
the
suicide
of
the
alleged
killer
and
his
wife
was
connected
to
the
Slender
Man
after
neighbors
told
the
media
that
he
would
often
dress
up
as
the
Internet
legend
and
parade
around
his
house
and
yard

In
the
summer
of
The
New
York
Times
published
an
article
detailing
the
suicides
of
multiple
young
people
between
the
ages
of
and
who
had
committed
suicide
on
the
Pine
Ridge
Reservation
in
South
Dakota
in
the
previous
six
months
alone

What
is
particularly
interesting
about
this
wave
of
suicides
is
that
the
article
also
claimed
that
several
officials
with
knowledge
of
the
cases
said
that
at
least
one
of
the
youths
who
committed
suicide
was
influenced
by
Slender
Man

What
is
further
interesting
about
the
alleged
connections
to
the
Slender
Man
legends
and
these
tragic
deaths
are
legends
of
the
reservation
itself

They
speak
of
a
spirit
named
the
Tall
Man
or
Walking
Sam

What
this
spirit
did
was
to
encourage
those
he
chose
to
visit
to
take
their
own
lives

It
is
perhaps
a
coincidence
that
there
are
similarities
between
the
legends
of
the
Slender
Man
and
these
Native
American
legends

However
the
coming
together
of
them
within
this
reservation
s
community
very
well
might
have
resulted
in
tragic
consequences

A
particularly
grim
account
tells
of
a
narrowly
aborted
mass
suicide
at
the
same
reservation
mentioned
above

According
to
the
story
multiple
teenagers
suddenly
set
out
to
a
specific
spot
in
the
woods
and
started
preparing
ropes
by
tying
them
to
the
branches
of
the
trees

They
were
clearly
planning
on
committing
suicide
hanging
themselves
together
as
a
group

The
local
pastor
on
the
reservation
John
Two
Bulls
heard
of
the
morose
plans
and
immediately
set
out
to
the
location

He
fortunately
managed
to
halt
the
proceedings
and
seemingly
bring
the
group
out
of
whatever
mass
trance
they
appeared
to
have
been
in

Rumblings
from
the
reservation
claimed
that
the
cause
of
the
attempted
mass
suicide
was
a
result
of
the
visitation
of
Walking
Sam

Given
the
publicity
that
the
Slender
Man
was
receiving
at
this
stage
it
is
perhaps
easy
to
understand
how
some
in
the
media
connected
the
legend
of
the
suicide
spirit
and
this
new
urban
legend

Account

Paranormal
author
and
researcher
Nick
Redfern
relayed
a
particularly
intriguing
account
that
was
told
to
him

The
witness
who
he
gave
the
name
Lacy
would
claim
to
have
had
several
real
life
encounters
with
the
Slender
Man
although
not
physical
encounters

She
would
claim
that
she
had
been
researching
the
Slender
Man
for
several
months

Then
one
evening
her
laptop
which
was
on
sleep
mode
suddenly
switched
on
of
its
own
accord

To
her
shock
an
image
of
a
faceless
creature
was
on
the
screen

Within
a
few
seconds
it
was
gone

She
told
herself
she
must
have
imagined
it

However
two
nights
later
the
laptop
once
more
switched
on
of
its
own
accord

When
it
did
the
face
appeared
again
only
this
time
it
was
much
clearer

Things
went
quiet
for
several
weeks
and
Lacy
had
almost
forgotten
the
incidents

That
was
until
her
laptop
came
on
again

This
time
a
strange
voice
came
from
the
device
stating
we
are
friends

It
was
at
this
point
that
Lacy
shut
the
laptop
down
and
ceased
her
research
into
the
Slender
Man
legends

It
is
easy
and
perhaps
right
to
suggest
that
what
Lacy
experienced
at
best
were
hallucinations
brought
on
by
her
intense
interest
in
and
subconscious
fear
of
the
Slender
Man
legends

It
is
interesting
to
note
once
more
though
that
the
fine
line
in
a
person
believing
in
a
legend
suddenly
making
it
real
is
indeed
delicate
in
the
extreme

Intense
Internet
Debate
What
If

Man
Was
Real
What
If
Slender
Man
Was
Real
Watch
this
video
on
YouTube
As
we
might
imagine
a
fierce
debate
ensued
following
the
attempting
stabbing
and
the
copycat
cases
that
followed

And
while
it
concentrated
on
the
Slender
Man
at
first
it
soon
moved
on
to
the
Internet
and
the
influence
it
has
on
children
in
general

For
example
in
the
Waukesha
School
District
where
the
attempted
murder
of
Payton
Leutner
took
place
Creepypasta
Wiki
was
blocked

For
their
part
the
administrators
of
the
website
claimed
that
the
stabbing
was
an
isolated
incident

They
also
claimed
their
website
was
a
literary
one
and
not
one
that
condoned
murder

Ultimately
it
was
reasoned
that
all
manner
of
films
TV
programs
and
video
games
that
children
had
access
to
did
not
result
in
such
atrocious
attacks

In
short
the
problem
was
with
the
attackers
themselves
as
opposed
to
the
apparent
catalyst

Although
the
debate
originally
had
momentum
the
more
it
went
on
the
less
sway
it
had

There
is
little
doubt
that
the
Slender
Man
is
the
Boogeyman
of
the
modern
age

If
you
talk
to
anyone
in
the
western
world
under
the
age
of
it
is
almost
certain
they
will
know
who
the
Slender
Man
is

They
might
not
know
the
history
or
even
how
they
heard
of
him
but
the
fact
is
they
know

And
although
they
understand
at
least
for
the
most
part
that
he
is
nothing
more
than
an
urban
legend
he
is
without
a
doubt
in
their
collective
subconscious

There
are
certainly
very
definite
similarities
between
the
Slender
Man
and
the
Boogeyman

Both
are
on
the
prowl
for
children
for
example
and
both
have
grim
abodes
in
out
of
the
way
locations
often
in
the
woods

Of
course
where
the
legend
of
the
Slender
Man
goes
from
here
remains
to
be
seen

Perhaps
he
will
still
be
spoken
in
hundreds
of
years
by
spooked
youngsters
around
the
world
as
much
as
he
is
today

The
Legend
of
Arsene
Wenger
If
Arsene
Wenger
s
career
was
a
kung
fu
movie
we
would
be
in
the
part
where
the
search
is
on
for
the
villain
who
poisoned
Arsene
s
rice

Taking
cues
from
the
charismatic
Frenchman
all
eyes
would
be
on
the
usual
suspects
the
media
referees
disloyal
players
Roy
Keane
Sam
Allardyce
and
the
most
obvious
targets
those
pin
stripe
suited
figures
throwing
around
Scrooge
McDuck
money
for
fun

But
this
film
s
twist
is
that
Arsene
may
have
stubbornly
poisoned
his
own
rice

Without
question
Arsene
Wenger
s
footballing
philosophy
is
the
stuff
of
legends
the
kind
of
stuff
that
inevitably
leads
to
statues
and
shops
with
corny
names

It
is
a
presence
in
football
that
can
t
quite
be
contextualized
and
fully
appreciated
until
you
run
down
a
laundry
list
of
coaches
and
realize
how
few
have
recognizable
philosophies
capable
of
lining
up
with
the
world
s
great
isms
communism
socialism
capitalism
Barcelonaism

But
as
with
all
great
isms
there
s
a
downside
and
Wengerism
is
no
exception
to
this
time
tested
rule

As
a
great
man
who
I
may
have
made
up
once
said
Shifting
landscapes
wait
for
no
philosophy

Back
in
Wengerism
took
the
world
by
surprise
and
by
world
of
course
I
mean
England

Arsene
was
a
career
coach
with
multiple
successes
under
his
belt
but
his
body
of
work
didn
t
quite
resonate
on
a
global
scale
until
he
replicated
his
successes
at
Arsenal
transforming
the
club
and
English
football
along
the
way

His
philosophy
was
built
by
tapping
into
a
continental
pool
of
players
that
had
yet
to
be
realized
or
trusted
by
his
peers
in
England

Add
the
Japanese
inspired
modifications
to
the
traditional
English
training
regimen
and
some
good
old
fashioned
outside
the
box
thinking
and
the
insightful
Arsene
was
well
on
his
way
to
transforming
an
English
league
that
in
many
ways
was
in
desperate
need
of
modernization

Wengerism
quickly
became
easily
identifiable

Movement
pace
obscene
technical
ability
disregard
for
passports
and
a
dedication
to
healthy
living
collectively
became
Arsene
s
ayahuasca
an
Amazonian
psychedelic
drug
thought
to
transform
how
you
view
the
world


Over
his
first
few
years
England
stood
transfixed
as
if
in
a
drug
induced
state

The
world
inhaled

And
then
inhaled
again

I
certainly
did

Multiple
times

Few
could
outrun
Wenger
s
newest
disciples
an
amalgamation
of
good
old
fashioned
Englishmen
seemingly
random
foreigners
and
a
superhero
Dutchman
who
was
scared
of
flying

The
trophies
were
immediate
and
people
soon
began
lining
up
around
the
corner
to
devour
the
teachings
on
tap
at
Highbury

Suddenly
a
Frenchman
was
the
philosopher
king
of
English
football

He
was
The
Professor
the
robed
noble
Frenchman
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
pitch
with
his
Coke
bottle
glasses
telling
the
world
that
the
era
of
English
football
as
we
knew
it
was
over

Fini

Mesmerized
slightly
disoriented
fans
and
media
types
weren
t
the
only
ones
to
succumb
to
Wengerism

Arsene
susceptible
to
the
trappings
of
success
just
like
previous
purveyors
of
transformative
thought
also
bought
into
Wengerism

And
that
s
where
the
trouble
begins

No
philosophy
not
even
the
most
transformative
should
go
unchallenged
forever

Looking
at
the
human
record
there
are
countless
examples
of
what
happens
when
individuals
develop
philosophies
that
successfully
end
up
radically
transforming
thought
and
or
behavior

Often
these
typically
charismatic
figures
peak
which
is
then
followed
by
a
slow
procession
into
a
delusional
state
characterized
by
a
fierce
bond
to
the
glory
days
and
a
perpetual
belief
that
a
formula
that
was
once
all
the
rage
will
be
so
again

It
s
just
a
matter
of
time
isn
t
it
That
s
the
worrying
and
poisonous
component
of
success

Sure
it
s
not
an
absolute
it
doesn
t
cripple
everyone

But
Arsene
s
steadfast
reliance
on
a
philosophy
that
initially
brought
success
just
might
be
the
very
poison
that
leads
to
his
demise

Said
another
way
Arsene
may
have
unknowingly
betrayed
himself

Arsene
transformed
football
by
keeping
his
mind
open
to
new
approaches
and
angles

He
absorbed
what
leagues
and
cultures
had
to
offer
and
hit
the
English
scene
at
the
right
time
with
the
right
recipe

But
since
then
one
way
to
view
Arsene
s
stance
is
that
he
has
stood
still
staunch
in
his
belief
that
his
philosophy
is
the
end

The
irony
is
that
this
highly
cerebral
being
may
have
reached
a
point
of
success
only
to
discard
the
one
thing
that
brought
him
success
an
open
mind

All
philosophies
must
evolve
and
like
all
hardened
souls
who
have
doubled
down
on
their
philosophies
as
gospel
after
initial
successes
learn
being
right
and
successful
at
a
specific
point
in
time
doesn
t
make
you
right
for
eternity
or
right
under
all
conditions

The
Arsenal
philosophy
worked
with
a
certain
set
of
players
at
a
certain
point
in
time
in
a
certain
market
almost
to
perfection

But
unfortunately
for
Arsenal
we
no
longer
live
in
that
world

Arsene
no
longer
has
the
jump
on
foreign
markets

No
longer
are
there
remote
corners
of
the
globe

Globalization
has
arrived
and
what
was
once
Wenger
s
Coca
Cola
formula
is
now
public
knowledge

Now
the
race
for
continental
talent
the
talent
necessary
to
execute
football
The
Arsenal
Way
can
be
purchased
by
anyone
with
access
to
mines
oil
or
vast
resources
of
chicken

No
longer
is
Arsene
s
spell
alone
enough
to
draw
players
who
can
now
express
themselves
at
much
higher
salaries
elsewhere

Yet
for
some
reason
we
still
reflexively
talk
about
sexy
football
at
Arsenal

Why
If
we
are
being
honest
sexy
football
hasn
t
been
around
for
some
time

All
you
need
to
do
is
look
at
the
style
that
was
on
display
at
Highbury
a
decade
ago
which
admittedly
is
a
high
standard
for
any
team
to
see
how
the
latest
versions
of
the
team
are
much
closer
to
Inconvincible
than
Invincible

Check
your
bowl
Arsene
may
have
poisoned
your
rice
too

We
re
all
wondering
how
this
movie
ends

Does
Arsene
take
his
own
life
by
continuing
to
eat
his
poisoned
rice
or
is
there
another
twist
a
twist
where
the
director
reveals
that
Arsene
has
actually
mastered
skills
taught
at
competing
monasteries
and
defeats
Manchester
City
in
the
final
fight
scene
using
Qatar
style
At
first
glance
changing
Arsene
may
be
as
difficult
a
task
as
convincing
Chairman
Mao
to
accept
capitalism
or
convincing
Richard
Dawkins
to
accept
Jesus
as
his
savior

But
regardless
of
what
he
decides
the
landscape
around
him
will
continue
to
change

That
is
inevitable

It
is
also
likely
we
will
inevitably
learn
that
training
young
players
to
compete
The
Arsenal
Way
only
to
break
through
and
find
out
that
other
teams
have
already
explored
the
world
and
brought
in
experienced
players
already
capable
of
playing
The
Arsenal
Way
while
selling
farm
raised
Arsenal
Way
players
to
these
same
clubs
is
a
suspect
formula
and
one
that
looks
to
be
unsustainable

Arsene
has
a
strong
commendable
philosophy
but
if
he
wants
to
continue
being
a
savior
and
avoid
end
of
career
buffoonery
and
caricature
he
must
learn
to
proactively
introduce
experienced
serious
talent
into
his
team
or
risk
losing
the
reputation
that
he
has
spent
his
life
rightfully
developing

I
wish
it
didn
t
work
that
way

It
isn
t
fair

But
it
is
and
today
reputations
are
easier
than
ever
to
build

They
are
also
notoriously
easy
to
dismantle
bastardize
and
destroy

But
it
isn
t
all
doom
and
gloom

If
you
are
wearing
your
prescription
rose
tinted
glasses
the
potentially
good
news
is
that
Arsene
already
knows
all
of
this

It
has
now
come
out
that
back
when
Arsenal
was
in
desperate
need
for
a
goalkeeper
they
bid
million
for
Liverpool
s
Pepe
Reina

They
seemingly
made
bids
for
Borussia
Dortmund
playmaker
Mario
G
tze
Lyon
playmaker
Yoann
Gourcuff
Rennes
holding
midfielder
Yann
M
Vila
and
maybe
even
Lille
hotshot
Eden
Hazard

Each
of
these
bids
and
these
are
only
some
of
the
ones
that
have
surfaced
would
have
broken
Arsenal
s
record
transfer
fee

These
bids
suggest
one
important
thing
Arsene
knows
and
he
s
now
willing
to
spend
well
beyond
what
he
has
spent
in
the
past

Whether
he
s
willing
to
spend
enough
is
another
question

So
the
potentially
good
news
for
Arsenal
fans
is
that
Arsene
s
poisoned
rice
may
not
kill
him
but
rather
might
have
strengthened
his
immunity
and
expanded
his
powers

He
may
just
be
waiting
for
the
right
moment
in
the
movie
to
maintain
the
appropriate
level
of
suspense

If
this
is
the
case
this
kung
fu
movie
may
have
one
last
hilarious
unexpected
turn

In
the
meantime
keep
your
eye
on
your
rice

debated
photo
from
may
be

the
legend
of

dates
back

invasion
of

birth
of
a
legend
When
the
Romans
first
came
to
northern
Scotland
in
the
first
century
A
D

they
found
the
Highlands
occupied
by
fierce
tattoo
covered
tribes
they
called
the
Picts
or
painted
people

From
the
carved
standing
stones
still
found
in
the
region
around
Loch
Ness
it
is
clear
the
Picts
were
fascinated
by
animals
and
careful
to
render
them
with
great
fidelity

All
the
animals
depicted
on
the
Pictish
stones
are
lifelike
and
easily
recognizable
all
but
one

The
exception
is
a
strange
beast
with
an
elongated
beak
or
muzzle
a
head
locket
or
spout
and
flippers
instead
of
feet

Described
by
some
scholars
as
a
swimming
elephant
the
Pictish
beast
is
the
earliest
known
evidence
for
an
idea
that
has
held
sway
in
the
Scottish
Highlands
for
at
least
years
that
Loch
Ness
is
home
to
a
mysterious
aquatic
animal

In
Scottish
folklore
large
animals
have
been
associated
with
many
bodies
of
water
from
small
streams
to
the
largest
lakes
often
labeled
Loch
na
Beistie
on
old
maps

These
water
horses
or
water
kelpies
are
said
to
have
magical
powers
and
malevolent
intentions

According
to
one
version
of
the
legend
the
water
horse
lures
small
children
into
the
water
by
offering
them
rides
on
its
back

Once
the
children
are
aboard
their
hands
become
stuck
to
the
beast
and
they
are
dragged
to
a
watery
death
their
livers
washing
ashore
the
following
day

The
earliest
written
reference
linking
such
creatures
to
Loch
Ness
is
in
the
biography
of
Saint
Columba
the
man
credited
with
introducing
Christianity
to
Scotland

In
A
D

according
to
this
account
Columba
was
on
his
way
to
visit
a
Pictish
king
when
he
stopped
along
the
shore
of
Loch
Ness

Seeing
a
large
beast
about
to
attack
a
man
who
was
swimming
in
the
lake
Columba
raised
his
hand
invoking
the
name
of
God
and
commanding
the
monster
to
go
back
with
all
speed

The
beast
complied
and
the
swimmer
was
saved

of
Loch

The
Loch
Ness
Monster
has
been
headline
news
all
over
the
world
for
more
than
years

Daily
Mail
When
Nicholas
Witchell
a
future
BBC
correspondent
researched
the
history
of
the
legend
for
his
book
The
Loch
Ness
Story
he
found
about
a
dozen
pre
th
century
references
to
large
animals
in
Loch
Ness
gradually
shifting
in
character
from
these
clearly
mythical
accounts
to
something
more
like
eyewitness
descriptions

a
th
century
sensation
The
modern
legend
of
Loch
Ness
dates
from
when
a
new
road
was
completed
along
the
shore
offering
the
first
clear
views
of
the
loch
from
the
northern
side

One
April
afternoon
a
local
couple
was
driving
home
along
this
road
when
they
spotted
an
enormous
animal
rolling
and
plunging
on
the
surface

Their
account
was
written
up
by
a
correspondent
for
the
Inverness
Courier
whose
editor
used
the
word
monster
to
describe
the
animal

The
Loch
Ness
Monster
has
been
a
media
phenomenon
ever
since

Public
interest
built
gradually
during
the
spring
of
then
picked
up
sharply
after
a
couple
reported
seeing
one
of
the
creatures
on
land
lumbering
across
the
shore
road

By
October
several
London
newspapers
had
sent
correspondents
to
Scotland
and
radio
programs
were
being
interrupted
to
bring
listeners
the
latest
news
from
the
loch

A
British
circus
offered
a
reward
of
for
the
capture
of
the
beast

Hundreds
of
boy
scouts
and
outdoorsmen
arrived
some
venturing
out
in
small
boats
others
setting
up
deck
chairs
and
waiting
expectantly
for
the
monster
to
appear

The
excitement
over
the
monster
reached
a
fever
pitch
in
December
when
the
London
Daily
Mail
hired
an
actor
film
director
and
big
game
hunter
named
Marmaduke
Wetherell
to
track
down
the
beast

After
only
a
few
days
at
the
loch
Wetherell
reported
finding
the
fresh
footprints
of
a
large
four
toed
animal

He
estimated
it
to
be
feet
long

With
great
fanfare
Wetherell
made
plaster
casts
of
the
footprints
and
just
before
Christmas
sent
them
off
to
the
Natural
History
Museum
in
London
for
analysis

While
the
world
waited
for
the
museum
zoologists
to
return
from
holiday
legions
of
monster
hunters
descended
on
Loch
Ness
filling
the
local
hotels

Inverness
was
floodlit
for
the
occasion
and
traffic
jammed
the
shoreline
roads
in
both
directions

Marmaduke
Wetherell
Big

ABC
News
The
bubble
burst
in
early
January
when
museum
zoologists
announced
that
the
footprints
were
those
of
a
hippopotamus

They
had
been
made
with
a
stuffed
hippo
foot
the
base
of
an
umbrella
stand
or
ashtray

It
wasn
t
clear
whether
Wetherell
was
the
perpetrator
of
the
hoax
or
its
gullible
victim

Either
way
the
incident
tainted
the
image
of
the
Loch
Ness
Monster
and
discouraged
serious
investigation
of
the
phenomenon

For
the
next
three
decades
most
scientists
scornfully
dismissed
reports
of
strange
animals
in
the
loch

Those
sightings
that
weren
t
outright
hoaxes
they
said
were
the
result
of
optical
illusions
caused
by
boat
wakes
wind
slicks
floating
logs
otters
ducks
or
swimming
deer

Saw
Something
They
Did
Nevertheless
eyewitnesses
continued
to
come
forward
with
accounts
of
their
sightings
more
than
of
them
according
to
Witchell
s
estimate

Most
of
the
witnesses
described
a
large
creature
with
one
or
more
humps
protruding
above
the
surface
like
the
hull
of
an
upturned
boat

Others
reported
seeing
a
long
neck
or
flippers

What
was
most
remarkable
however
was
that
many
of
the
eyewitnesses
were
sober
level
headed
people
lawyers
and
priests
scientists
and
school
teachers
policemen
and
fishermen
even
a
Nobel
Prize
winner

In
the
s
a
local
doctor
named
Constance
Whyte
began
collecting
these
eyewitness
accounts
along
with
sketches
of
what
the
people
had
seen
finally
publishing
them
in
as
a
book
entitled
More
Than
a
Legend

Noting
that
many
of
her
friends
had
been
subjected
to
ridicule
and
contempt
Whyte
said
her
goal
in
writing
the
book
was
the
vindication
of
many
people
of
integrity
who
had
reported
honestly
what
they
had
seen
in
Loch
Ness

Whyte

inspired
a
new
generation
of

including
Tim
Dinsdale
who
on
his
first
visit
to
the

took
an
intriguing
film
of
something
moving
across

and
promptly
gave
up

devote

keeping
a

on
the

from

But
perhaps
the
most
important
effect
of
Whyte
s
book
was
to
turn
the
tide
of
public
opinion

Long
dismissed

fodder
for

press
reports
Nessie
was
finally
considered
a
subject
worthy
of
serious
scientific
investigation

In
the
span
of
a
decade
beginning
in
four
separate
expeditions
were
launched
first
by
the
BBC
then
by
three
respected
British
universities
Oxford
Cambridge
and
the
University
of
Birmingham

Rather
than
scanning
the
surface
with
binoculars
and
cameras
as
the
amateur
investigators
had
these
expeditions
came
equipped
with
sonar
a
military
technology
that
used
sound
to
search
the
underwater
environment

Though
the
expeditions
found
nothing
conclusive
in
each
case
the
sonar
operators
detected
large
moving
underwater
objects
they
could
not
explain

The
use
of
technology
to
search
the
loch
reached
a
new
level
in
the
s
when
a
series
of
expeditions
was
sponsored
by
the
Boston
based
Academy
of
Applied
Science
whose
members
included
many
technically
skilled
people
with
ties
to
MIT

The
Academy
s
approach
was
to
set
a
trap
for
the
monster
by
combining
sonar
and
underwater
photography
for
the
first
time

Under
the
leadership
of
Robert
Rines
a
lawyer
trained
in
physics
the
team
pointed
a
sophisticated
form
of
sonar
called
side
scan
sonar
out
into
Loch
Ness
from
a
point
near
the
shore

Nearby
they
placed
an
underwater
camera
taking
pictures
every
seconds
as
a
strobe
light
illuminated
the
depths
with
a
bright
flash

The
system
paid
off
one
night
in


At
the
same
moment
the
sonar
was
registering
a
large
moving
object
the
underwater
camera
was
taking
pictures
of
an
object
that
looked
after
development
and
computer
enhancement
like
the
flippers
of
an
aquatic
creature

Rines
discovery
won
the
support
of
two
reputable
scientists
Harold
Doc
Edgerton
the
legendary
MIT
scientist
who
had
invented
side
scan
sonar
and
strobe
photography
and
Sir
Peter
Scott
one
of
Britain
s
most
respected
naturalists

With
Edgerton
and
Scott
behind
him
Rines
was
given
an
opportunity
to
present
his
evidence
at
a
hearing
at
the
House
of
Commons
in
London

Never
had
the
possibility
of
the
Loch
Ness
Monster
been
taken
so
seriously

Almost
immediately
however
critics
began
to
raise
questions
about
the
evidence

Could
the
suggestive
sonar
traces
be
the
result
of
human
error
Had
the
flipper
photos
been
altered
to
improve
their
appearance
Just
as
damaging
to
Rines
case
was
Peter
Scott
s
bold
pronouncement
about
the
identity
of
the
creature

Based
on
the
flipper
photos
and
the
eyewitness
sightings
Scott
concluded
that
Nessie
was
a
plesiosaur
an
ancient
reptile
that
was
thought
to
have
gone
extinct
along
with
the
dinosaurs
some
million
years
ago

The
idea
was
just
too
far
fetched
for
professional
zoologists
to
take
seriously

This
painting
by
Sir
Peter

a
respected
British
naturalist
helped
create
the
popular
image
of

an
ancient
reptile

Although
zoologists
have
yet
to
conduct
the
full
scale
investigation
Rines
hoped
to
trigger
the
loch
continues
to
yield
intriguing
sonar
hits

In
an
expedition
called
Operation
Deep
Scan
used
a
flotilla
of
sonar
equipped
boats
to
sweep
the
loch
with
a
curtain
of
sound
the
operation
yielded
three
underwater
targets
that
could
not
be
explained

In
the
early
s
the
BBC
s
Nicholas
Witchell
helped
organize
Project
Urquhart
the
first
extensive
study
of
the
loch
s
biology
and
geology

Although
they
weren
t
looking
for
monsters
the
expedition
s
sonar
operators
detected
a
large
moving
underwater
target
and
followed
it
for
several
minutes
before
losing
it

And
during
the
expedition
featured
in
NOVA
s
Loch
Ness
film
Rines
and
his
longtime
colleague
Charles
Wyckoff
detected
yet
another
puzzling
underwater
target

According
to
the
expedition
s
sonar
expert
marine
biologist
Arne
Carr
it
was
a
moving
target
appeared
to
be
biological
in
nature
and
was
about
feet

Famous
Photo
Falsified
In
the
years
since
the
birth
of
the
modern
legend
dozens
of
people
have
come
forward
with
photographs
purporting
to
show
the
monster

Most
were
quickly
dismissed
as
either
outright
frauds
or
images
of
ordinary
objects
mistaken
for
monsters

But
one
photo
stood
above
the
rest

Taken
in
it
shows
what
appears
to
be
the
slender
neck
of
an
animal
rising
from
the
surface
of
the
water

From
the
moment
it
was
published
in
the
London
Daily
Mail
it
became
the
very
image
of
the
Loch
Ness
Monster
and
for
many
the
strongest
evidence
that
Nessie
actually
exists

The
surgeon
s
photo
published
in
became
the
very
image
of
the
Loch
Ness
Monster

Fortean
Pictures
Library
One
reason
the
photograph
had
such
an
impact
on
the
Loch
Ness
legend
was
that
it
came
from
such
a
credible
source

The
photo
was
sold
to
the
Daily
Mail
by
a
London
physician
named
R

Kenneth
Wilson
who
said
he
had
taken
the
picture
when
he
noticed
a
commotion
in
the
water
as
he
was
driving
up
from
London
to
photograph
birds
with
a
friend
near
Inverness

Few
believed
that
such
a
respected
doctor
could
be
party
to
a
deception

R

Kenneth
Wilson
The
credibility
of
the
surgeon
s
photo
hinged
on
its
source
a
respected
London
doctor
named
R

Kenneth
Wilson

Fortean
Pictures
Library
But
in
years
after
the
photo
was
first
published
newspapers
around
the
world
reported
the
claim
that
the
surgeon
s
photo
was
a
fake
part
of
an
elaborate
plot
to
dupe
the
Daily
Mail

The
man
behind
the
story
was
a
former
English
art
teacher
named
Alastair
Boyd
who
had
become
an
avid
student
of
Loch
Ness
lore
after
he
and
his
wife
had
had
their
own
sighting
of
a
large
animal
in
the
loch
in


Years
later
a
friend
of
Boyd
s
named
David
Martin
discovered
an
old
newspaper
clipping
in
which
Ian
Wetherell
the
son
of
Marmaduke
Wetherell
of
hippo
foot
fame
claimed
the
surgeon
s
photo
was
a
hoax

The
article
had
attracted
little
attention
when
it
was
published
in
but
two
details
caught
Boyd
s
eye

First
Wetherell
said
the
plot
had
involved
a
man
named
Maurice
Chambers
the
very
same
man
that
Dr

Wilson
said
he
had
driven
up
from
London
to
visit
in


Second
Wetherell
mentioned
that
the
surgeon
s
photograph
included
the
scenery
of
Loch
Ness
in
the
background

In
fact
the
familiar
Nessie
photo
includes
only
the
protruding
neck
and
the
water
around
it

Boyd
knew
that
the
original
photo
had
included
a
bit
of
the
far
shoreline
in
the
background
because
he
had
rediscovered
the
uncropped
version
in
the
late
s

But
that
full
photo
had
been
published
only
once
in


So
how
could
Wetherell
have
known
this
detail
Either
he
had
a
very
long
memory
or
he
took
the
picture
Boyd
says

surgeon
s
photo
uncropped
The
full
uncropped
surgeon
s
photo
published
only
once
in
was
rediscovered
by
Boyd
more
than
years
later

Fortean
Pictures
Library
Ian
Wetherell
had
died
by
the
time
Boyd
and
Martin
read
the
article
but
they
were
able
to
track
down
his
step
brother
Christian
Spurling
in
the
south
of
England

Spurling
and
near
death
confessed

Unhappy
with
the
way
he
was
treated
by
the
Daily
Mail
after
the
hippo
foot
fiasco
Duke
Wetherell
had
set
out
to
get
his
revenge
enlisting
his
son
and
step
son
in
the
plot

First
Spurling
built
a
model
monster
by
grafting
a
head
and
neck
onto
the
conning
tower
of
a
toy
submarine

Then
Wetherell
and
his
son
Ian
drove
up
to
the
loch
and
staged
the
photograph
taking
care
to
include
the
actual
Loch
Ness
scenery
in
the
background

Finally
to
conceal
his
own
role
in
the
hoax
Wetherell
persuaded
Dr

Wilson
through
their
common
friend
Chambers
to
have
the
photo
developed
and
sell
it
to
the
Daily
Mail
as
his
own

The
plot
worked
better
than
any
of
them
could
have
imagined

Not
everyone
accepts
the
Spurling
story

American
journalist
Richard
Smith
for
example
notes
that
toy
experts
question
whether
the
toy
submarines
of
the
s
could
have
performed
as
described
and
he
wonders
why
Boyd
waited
until
after
Spurling
s
death
to
reveal
his
confession

But
in
the
aftermath
of
Boyd
s
bombshell
most
people
now
believe
the
surgeon
s
photo
was
yet
another
Loch
Ness
hoax

The
year
old
stepson
of
Marmaduke
Wetherell
told
Boyd
he
made
the
monster
in
the
picture
by
grafting
a
plastic
wood
neck
to
a
toy
submarine

WGBH
Educational
Foundation
Does
that
finally
disprove
the
monster
s
existence
Not
at
all
says
Boyd

One
of
the
great
ironies
of
the
Loch
Ness
story
is
that
the
man
who
brought
down
the
most
famous
piece
of
evidence
remains
a
firm
believer
in
Nessie

I
am
so
convinced
of
the
reality
of
these
creatures
that
I
would
actually
stake
my
life
on
their
existence
he
told
NOVA

I
trust
my
eyesight




I
used
to
make
my
living
teaching
people
how
to
observe
and
I
know
that
the
thing
I
saw
was
not
a
log
or
an
otter
or
a
wave
or
anything
like
that

It
was
a
large
animal

It
came
heaving
out
of
the
water
something
like
a
whale

I
mean
the
part
that
was
actually
on
the
surface
when
it
stopped
rolling
through
was
at
least
feet
long

It
was
totally
extraordinary

It
s
the
most
amazing
thing
I
ve
ever
seen
in
my
life
and
if
I
could
afford
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
looking
for
another
glimpse
of
it
I
would

The
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollow
Washington
Irving
Historic
Hudson
Valley
Presents
Beloved
by
generations
of
readers
Washington
Irving
s
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollow
ranks
among
the
classics
of
American
literature

Although
it
is
one
of
Irving
s
shortest
works
it
has
had
a
long
life
since
it
first
was
published
in


For
nearly
years
the
story
has
captured
the
imagination
of
both
children
and
adults

The
characters
setting
and
events
come
alive
through
Irving
s
descriptions
and
artists
of
all
types
have
used
the
story
for
source
material

From
shortly
after
the
story
s
first
publication
until
today
the
story
has
inspired
creative
works
illustrations
paintings
sculpture
music
films
television
shows
even
advertising

The
Story
Legend
possesses
elements
of
a
thriller
but
at
the
heart
of
the
tale
is
a
love
triangle
set
in
Sleepy
Hollow
on
the
shore
of
the
Hudson
River
at
the
turn
of
the
th
century

Ichabod
Crane
an
itinerant
schoolteacher
falls
for
Katrina
Van
Tassel
the
pretty
daughter
of
a
prosperous
local
family

Ichabod
s
gangling
appearance
and
odd
habits
as
well
as
his
obvious
attraction
to
Katrina
make
him
an
easy
target
for
Katrina
s
other
suitor
Brom
Bones
the
swaggering
village
blade
in
Irving
s
description

Tension
builds
between
Brom
and
Ichabod
until
one
dark
autumn
night
when
Ichabod
riding
along
a
lonely
wooded
road
finds
himself
with
a
ghostly
headless
companion

Overwhelmed
by
fear
and
all
the
spooky
tales
he
has
heard
Ichabod
flees
hoping
to
reach
the
security
of
the
nearby
bridge
and
churchyard

The
horseman
gives
chase
and
just
as
Ichabod
reaches
safety
the
horseman
throws
what
appears
to
be
his
head
at
the
schoolteacher

The
next
day
Ichabod
cannot
be
found
but
the
villagers
discover
his
horse
and
the
remains
of
a
pumpkin
leaving
the
reader
to
speculate
as
to
what
happened

Was
Ichabod
s
encounter
with
a
true
ghost
Or
was
he
the
victim
of
a
cruel
prank
Irving
s
inspirations
Irving
wrote
Legend
while
living
in
England

Some
scholars
suggest
Irving
s
tale
may
have
been
inspired
by
folk
stories
he
heard
during
his
time
abroad

German
English
and
Scandinavian
folktales
involving
a
headless
rider
chasing
hapless
travelers
have
been
told
for
many
generations

Irving
may
have
heard
or
read
versions
of
these
tales
and
reimagined
his
own
iteration
in
the
Hudson
River
Valley
setting
he
knew
so
well

The
author
incorporated
many
local
names
and
details
adding
an
air
of
authenticity
to
his
telling

He
also
claimed
that
the
original
text
was
found
among
the
papers
of
the
late
Diedrich
Knickerbocker
who
in
turn
heard
the
tale
recounted
by
a
pleasant
shabby
gentlemanly
old
fellow
some
years
earlier

These
layers
of
authorship
remind
readers
of
the
essential
nature
of
a
legend
a
story
told
and
retold
by
tradition
and
no
longer
verifiable

Critical
Success
Legend
formed
part
of
The
Sketch
Book
of
Geoffrey
Crayon
a
set
of
stories
written
by
Irving
and
published
in
installments
in
and


Very
quickly
readers
latched
on
to
Irving
s
work

Good
reviews
from
Irving
s
influential
literary
friends
helped
but
critics
outside
his
circle
raved
too

English
critics
were
favorably
impressed
that
an
American
author
could
write
so
well
and
Irving
delighted
in
having
upended
English
literary
prejudices

Multiple
reprints
and
editions
followed
in
England
and
in
the
United
States
as
well
as
foreign
language
translations

The
early
literary
success
of
The
Sketch
Book
helped
Irving
to
build
his
career
as
a
writer
and
eventually
enabled
him
to
purchase
Sunnyside
make
improvements
to
the
property
and
help
his
family
members
financially

Legend
has
never
been
out
of
print
since
it
first
was
published

Irving
wrote
many
other
works
but
arguably
Legend
remains
the
most
popular
perhaps
because
fans
of
the
story
love
to
be
a
bit
frightened
imagining
themselves
in
Ichabod
s
saddle
fleeing
for
their
lives
from
a
headless
phantom

A
Part
of
Popular
Culture
Irving
makes
no
mention
of
Halloween
in
his
tale
rather
he
set
the
climax
in
the
evening
of
a
fine
autumnal
day

The
ghostly
and
frightening
elements
of
the
tale
however
mean
it
is
now
closely
associated
with
the
holiday

The
link
is
strengthened
by
artists
who
have
shown
the
horseman
carrying
a
scary
jack
o
lantern
as
a
head
embellishing
what
Irving
only
suggests
that
the
horseman
s
head
was
actually
a
pumpkin

Thanks
to
the
wide
readership
of
Irving
s
story
now
combined
with
the
number
of
people
who
know
one
of
the
many
children
s
editions
comic
books
animated
cartoons
films
or
television
shows
inspired
by
the
tale
the
characters
are
well
known
and
easily
identified

They
have
been
appropriated
and
reimagined
and
as
a
result
have
become
even
further
embedded
in
American
popular
culture

Through
new
vehicles
and
representations
Irving
s
tale
keeps
audiences
amused
captivated
and
terrified
after
nearly
two
centuries

Why
Are
Arthurian
Legends
So
Popular
Source
It
is
wholly
possible
that
you
have
come
across
an
adaptation
of
Arthurian
legend
at
some
point
in
your
life

After
all
there
have
been
so
many
interpretations
across
varying
genres
and
media
that
an
entire
Wikipedia
page
has
been
dedicated
to
listing
them
all

One
of
the
most
well
known
works
includes
Sir
Thomas
Malory
s
Le
Morte
d
Arthur

It
has
been
deemed
the
most
extensive
and
culturally
important
work
based
on
Arthurian
legends

This
is
because
it
goes
in
depth
into
the
histories
of
many
characters
notably
the
more
prominent
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
and
Arthur
himself

Le
Morte
d
Arthur
has
inspired
other
great
works
such
as
T
H

White
s
The
Once
and
Future
King

Arthurian
legends
have
also
been
often
referenced
in
parodies
such
as
Monty
Python
and
the
third
Shrek
movie

With
all
these
different
retellings
of
Arthurian
legend
it
becomes
clear
that
they
are
widely
celebrated
even
within
pop
culture

That
leads
us
to
the
question
why
are
Arthurian
legends
so
popular
in
the
first
place
The
general
storyline
of
Arthurian
legends
goes
something
like
this
Arthur
guided
by
the
eccentric
wizard
Merlin
obtains
the
legendary
sword
Excalibur
and
becomes
King
of
Camelot

In
some
versions
he
acquires
the
sword
from
the
Lady
of
the
Lake

In
others
he
retrieves
the
sword
from
its
immovable
place
in
stone

He
then
held
court
in
Camelot
and
was
aided
by
the
many
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
his
rule
peaceful
and
prosperous

Eventually
King
Arthur
and
the
Knights
set
off
on
a
quest
to
find
the
immortality
granting
Holy
Grail

While
they
are
away
Lancelot
one
of
the
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
engages
in
adultery
with
Queen
Guinevere

An
enraged
King
Arthur
starts
a
civil
war
upon
receiving
word
of
the
affair

However
King
Arthur
s
rule
was
ultimately
brought
to
an
end
when
he
was
betrayed
by
the
Camelot
s
regent
Mordred
who
sought
to
seize
the
throne
for
himself

The
resulting
battle
ended
with
both
King
Arthur
and
Mordred
meeting
their
demise

After
his
death
King
Arthur
was
sent
on
a
boat
to
Avalon
where
he
is
presumed
to
remain
until
today

It
is
said
that
someday
when
Great
Britain
is
in
dire
need
King
Arthur
will
return
to
save
his
people

It
is
likely
that
Arthurian
legends
are
popular
due
to
its
character
archetypes
and
storytelling

Arthurian
legends
feature
characters
that
possess
distinct
personalities
or
capabilities
yet
still
leave
a
lot
of
room
open
for
interpretation

This
is
especially
the
case
for
characters
who
are
fan
favourites
including
Merlin
Morgan
le
Fay
and
Lancelot

There
are
retellings
centred
around
these
specific
characters

For
instance
BBC
s
Merlin
series
and
French
drama
Lancelot
du
Lac

Many
characters
in
Arthurian
legends
represent
beloved
archetypes
commonly
found
in
literature

As
an
example
King
Arthur
expectedly
falls
under
the
Hero
archetype

This
is
evident
through
his
tremendous
courage
and
dignity
making
him
the
perfect
example
of
chivalry

He
is
able
to
triumph
in
multiple
challenges
throughout
his
life
and
manages
to
ensure
peace
while
he
remains
King

Archetypes
can
also
be
easily
assigned
to
other
characters
in
Arthurian
legend

An
example
would
be
Merlin
who
falls
under
the
Mentor
archetype

Equipped
with
knowledge
and
magical
abilities
Merlin
acted
as
an
advisor
to
Arthur
as
he
was
growing
up
hence
becoming
a
great
influence
to
Arthur

The
Hero
and
Mentor
archetypes
as
well
as
styles
of
character
have
been
replicated
in
famous
works
for
example
Aragorn
and
Gandalf
respectively
from
J
R
R

Tolkien
s
Lord
of
the
Rings
trilogy

Character
tropes
are
still
commonly
used
in
the
realms
of
fiction
and
literature

They
are
viewed
as
incredibly
important
as
they
are
able
to
depict
particular
aspects
of
human
nature
and
life
thus
constructing
a
sense
of
familiarity
for
readers
or
the
audiences
of
a
variety
of
media

Another
reason
attributing
to
the
perseverance
of
archetypes
include
linking
the
current
text
to
established
identities
in
other
past
works
therefore
adding
supplementary
meaning
to
the
text

Consequently
it
is
not
exceptional
to
discover
that
numerous
characters
and
plots
resemble
or
overlap
with
that
of
Arthurian
legends
which
have
served
as
models
or
inspiration
for
later
works

Furthermore
Arthurian
legends
may
be
well
received
due
to
the
mystery
involved

There
is
no
definite
storyline
as
Arthurian
legends
are
pieced
together
from
a
number
of
different
sources

There
is
no
confirmation
on
which
version
is
the
original
adding
to
the
intrigue
revolving
around
the
tales

Arthur
s
birth
and
life
have
even
become
a
point
of
research
for
historians
while
some
scholars
claim
that
he
is
a
Celtic
deity
others
assume
that
he
was
a
real
person
of
Romano
Briton
origins

However
it
is
not
only
Arthur
that
is
subjected
to
such
ambiguity

The
characters
and
settings
surrounding
him
also
vary
in
terms
of
their
history
and
moral
alignment

Take
Morgan
le
Fay
for
example

She
is
portrayed
as
an
evil
sorceress
in
some
versions
but
is
shown
as
a
benevolent
healer
who
laid
Arthur
to
rest
at
Avalon

As
Arthurian
legends
are
known
to
end
on
a
cliffhanger
hence
Arthur
is
known
as
the
Once
and
Future
King
it
is
generally
agreed
upon
that
the
period
of
time
in
which
he
presumably
ruled
the
Golden
Age
has
passed
while
the
true
question
of
when
will
he
be
back
is
left
unanswered

The
obscurity
of
the
source
material
gives
artists
and
creators
the
freedom
to
come
up
with
their
own
versions
of
the
characters
and
the
story
based
on
their
own
takes
and
perspectives

The
temptations
of
filling
in
plot
holes
or
exploring
different
parts
of
Arthurian
legends
may
prove
to
be
too
alluring
to
withstand
for
storytellers

Apart
from
fiction
it
is
perhaps
because
we
know
so
much
yet
so
little
of
Arthurian
legends
that
academic
research
on
the
very
subject
is
still
carried
out
today

As
curator
Dr
ap
Huw
mentions
the
appeal
of
Arthur
is
that
he
was
or
is
whoever
you
want
him
to
be

Sure
Arthurian
legends
may
be
popular
but
at
the
possible
expense
of
angering
Arthurian
scholars
and
fans
are
the
legends
actually
important
The
answer
to
this
is
subjective
and
depends
on
the
audience
s
opinions

Still
it
cannot
be
denied
that
the
legends
are
classics
that
illustrate
an
important
piece
of
history
no
matter
Arthur
s
status
as
real
or
fiction

Like
fairytales
they
are
a
snapshot
of
how
and
what
people
s
beliefs
were
like
at
the
time

Arthurian
legends
have
also
been
proved
to
withstand
the
test
of
time
from
mediaeval
to
the
modern
era

As
mentioned
they
have
been
revamped
a
great
number
of
times
in
the
form
of
official
published
works
to
writings
across
fanfiction
sites
although
essentially
all
Arthur
retellings
are
fanfiction
of
sorts

It
has
become
a
cultural
work
of
considerable
significance
and
its
enduring
popularity
demonstrates
that
the
legends
are
still
fully
capable
of
attracting
a
sizable
audience
old
young
and
anywhere
in
between

The
many
adaptations
of
Arthurian
legends
in
the
fantasy
genre
like
C
S

Lewis
The
Chronicles
of
Narnia
and
even
George
Lucas
Star
Wars
undoubtedly
attest
to
the
legends
influence

Not
only
have
they
been
featured
heavily
in
fiction
and
academia
aspects
of
it
namely
Excalibur
and
mediaeval
armour
have
also
made
circles
in
the
fashion
world
as
seen
in
the
form
of
Italian
designer
Alberta
Ferretti
s
limited
edition
collection
inspired
by
King
Arthur

There
are
also
those
who
have
dedicated
their
time
and
effort
to
uncovering
the
real
life
counterparts
of
the
settings
in
which
Arthurian
legends
take
place

In
particular
it
has
been
widely
hypothesised
that
Avalon
could
in
actuality
be
Glastonbury
or
Isle
of
Man
though
the
lack
of
substantial
evidence
points
Avalon
to
be
a
myth
derived
from
early
Celtic
tales

The
story
of
King
Arthur
dives
into
romance
and
chivalry

Historian
Michael
Woods
suggests
that
King
Arthur
s
times
was
a
golden
age
of
lost
innocence
hence
forging
a
strong
connection
with
people
who
long
for
a
sense
of
dignity
and
justice
that
seem
to
only
exist
in
myth

The
diverse
interpretations
of
Arthurian
legends
also
bring
to
light
different
aspects
of
the
tale
such
as
the
contrasting
portrayals
of
Morgan
le
Fay
and
how
it
possesses
links
to
misogyny
and
the
storyteller
s
perspectives

What
do
you
think
of
when
it
comes
to
Arthurian
legends
Is
it
the
memorable
characters
the
beautiful
settings
or
the
weighty
symbolism
Do
you
have
any
theories
of
when
King
Arthur
will
rise
again
Arthurian
legends
can
mean
many
things
to
many
different
people

They
evolve
according
to
its
audience
and
their
expectations
as
well
as
understanding
of
the
stories

Even
so
it
is
evident
that
Arthurian
legends
remain
compelling
in
the
minds
of
the
people

As
the
BBC
reports
Romantics
may
hope
that
one
day
Arthur
will
return
to
rescue
his
people

But
if
he
lives
on
through
his
legend
the
ancient
monarch
it
would
appear
has
never
really
gone
away

An
Overview
of

gentlemen
By

airways
would
like
you
to
buckle
your
safety
belts
and
make
sure
your
seats
are
in
an
upright
locked
position
as
we
descend
into
our

and

s

MASTER
LEGEND
The
article
The
Legend
of
Master
Legend
written
by
Joshuah
Bearman
and
appearing
in
the
January
edition
of
Rolling
Stone
was
my
and
many
other
people
s
introduction
to
the
concept
of
real
life
superheroes

Reading
about
that
fascinating
idea
led
me
to
seeking
out
my
local
RLSH
the
Watchman
and
talking
with
him
led
me
to
forming
the
idea
that
I
would
like
to
write
a
book
on
this
subject

After
setting
up
a
MySpace
page
for
the
book
I
shortly
received
two
very
different
e
mails

One
was
from
someone
telling
me
what
a
great
awesome
guy
Master
Legend
was
and
that
I
should
get
in
contact
with
him

A
second
e
mail
told
me
that
Master
Legend
was
a
nutjob
and
they
were
sick
of
writers
using
him
as
a
representative
of
the
RLSH
community

And
so
it
has
gone
ever
since

I
have
seen
a
large
amount
of
debate
online
and
heard
many
people
s
opinions
on
the
phone
and
in
person

Because
of
this
amount
of
controversy
I
have
put
off
writing
about
the
man
here
on
my
blog
but
I
feel
the
time
is
now
to
have
a
thorough
discussion
about
him

My
goal
is
to
provide
as
fair
of
a
representative
of
views
supporting
or
criticizing
him

In
this
first
part
I
will
be
presenting
an
overview
of
pro
and
anti
statements
I
have
seen
repeatedly
during
my
course
of
writing
about
RLSH

PRO
LEGEND
Tales
of
Comic
Book
Bravado
and
Crimefighting
Something
that
appeals
to
some
RLSH
about
Master
Legend
is
that
he
is
very
dynamic
and
energetic

He
is
often
documented
running
jumping
and
doing
things
like
hitting
the
wall
of
his
garage
with
a
giant
metal
fist

He
makes
comic
book
exclamations
like
By
the
Gods
He
threatens
to
give
evil
doers
an
all
night
tour
of
Fist
City
His
stories
are
wild
action
packed
and
never
a
snoozefest

Some
of
them
are
fantastic
and
we
must
take
them
at
Master
Legend
s
word
since
the
only
witnesses
are
Master
Legend
himself
and
the
claimed
league
of
frightened
criminals
who
have
had
the
misfortune
of
crossing
paths
with
him

Here
s
a
recent
blog
post
There
has
been
an
evil
doer
in
my
town
and
you
know
I
won
t
allow
it

This
guy
known
as
Big
Red
has
been
terrorizing
my
homeless
friends
but
now
it
s
time
to
meet
the
Legend

This
guy
has
tried
to
evade
me
because
he
knows
of
the
whispered
tales
behind
shuttered
doors
of
Master
Legend

He
has
a
few
punks
that
do
crack
friends
so
I
got
Brimstone
to
come
along
for
mission
attack

I
knew
where
he
would
be
and
right
on
time

He
has
been
running
his
mouth
out
in
the
streets
saying
he
can
kick
Master
Legend
s
ass

I
tell
you
this
he
will
need
more
Cheerios
then
the
universe
has

So
yesterday
fellow
Team
Justice
member
Brimstone
and
I
made
a
quick
approach
in
the
Justice
Van

We
caught
him
hassling
my
friends
red
handed
so
I
told
him
so
you
want
to
kick
my
ass
here
s
your
chance
I
threw
off
my
shirt
and
slipped
on
my
fighting
gloves
and
said
alright
boy
you
can
run
your
mouth
but
can
you
run
your
fist
Sorry
to
say
the
big
lug
ran
for
it

He
got
on
his
bike
and
zoomed
away
faster
than
I
ever
saw
him
go
before
ha
ha
ha

It
just
goes
to
show
you
my
friends
that
the
bully
is
really
a
sissy
inside

It
is
up
to
us
all
to
stand
against
evil
and
destroy
it

I
know
if
we
all
work
together
we
can

It
s
a
good
story
I
see
why
people
would
like
it

An
evildoer
is
threatening
the
homeless
Master
Legend
shows
up
and
scares
him
off
then
parts
with
some
good
advice

If
Big
Red
was
hassling
my
homeless
friends
I
d
load
up
the
Justice
Van
with
Brimstone
and
go
threaten
to
kick
his
ass
too

Big
Red
if
you
re
reading
this
Fist
City

Master
Legend
s
energy
and
his
war
stories
are
contagious
and
has
won
him
RLSH
and
non
RLSH
fans
alike

Work
with
Team
Justice
Something
that
has
been
well
documented
are
the
things
he
does
with
Team
Justice
which
made
RLSH
history
by
becoming
the
first
RLSH
non
profit
group

Along
with
his
fellow
team
members
Superhero
Lady
Hero
Symbiote
Ace
Diamond
Brimstone
and
others
he
has
delivered
food
and
supplies
to
Florida
s
large
homeless
population

He
very
sensibly
has
handed
out
socks
to
the
homeless

That
may
seem
like
a
very
minor
thing
but
if
you
are
homeless
in
a
climate
like
Florida
s
clean
socks
aren
t
just
a
matter
of
being
more
comfortable
they
can
literally
be
a
life
saver
preventing
fatal
disease

He
has
participated
in
Christmas
time
toy
drives
charity
events
and
helped
distribute
flyers
of
missing
children

These
missions
are
well
documented
with
photos
and
video
which
you
can
see

Acting
as
a
Media
Ambassador
Besides
the
Rolling
Stone
article
mentioned
Master
Legend
has
attracted
media
attention
from
around
the
world
and
for
many
documentarians
flying
to
Florida
is
at
the
top
of
the
list

I
know
for
a
fact
he
has
been
visited
by
two
documentary
film
makers
in
the
last
two
months
and
receives
a
steady
stream
of
visiting
journalists
authors
documentary
film
makers
and
photographers

I
have
heard
rumors
that
he
has
had
interest
from
HBO
about
developing
a
show
of
some
kind
and
strangely
has
even
had
talks
about
his
own
cooking
show
Some
RLSH
say
this
media
attention
is
not
just
good
for
Master
Legend
but
good
for
RLSH
in
general

Not
only
that
but
Master
Legend
runs
his
own
RLSH
forum
leading
a
platoon
at
the
Master
Legend
Army
and
recently
began
his
own
internet
radio
entry
The
Master
Legend
Show

Can
Shred
on
Guitar
One
of
America
s
great
exports
besides
comic
book
superheroes
is
rock
n
roll
and
Master
Legend
likes
to
shred
on
the
guitar
as
evidenced
by
video
showing
him
performing
with
the
band
Alias
Punch
as
well
as
his
own
musical
projects

Master
Legend
tells
me
his
favorite
guitar
players
are
Randy
California
Spirit
also
played
with
Jimmy
Hendrix
Eric
Lifeson
Rush
and
Jeff
Beck
The
Yardbirds


It
stands
to
follow
that
Americans
like
superheroes
and
they
like
rock
n
roll
so
a
rock
n
roll
superhero
who
fights
crime
and
can
do
a
guitar
solo
is
going
to
impress
a
certain
amount
of
people

Recognition
From
Local
Law
Enforcement
In
The
Legend
of
Master
Legend
Joshuah
Bearman
reports
that
he
got
in
touch
with
a
local
police
Sergeant
who
spoke
favorably
of
Master
Legend

The
Sergeant
who
s
in
charge
of
vice
investigations
took
a
chance
and
tracked
Master
Legend
down

Based
on
the
neighborhood
he
figured
Master
Legend
might
be
a
good
local
contact

And
sure
enough
the
Sergeant
tells
me
I
start
getting
calls
from
Master
Legend
with
information

And
it
checks
out

Master
Legend
has
helped
put
away
a
few
criminals

Additionally
a
photo
on
MySpace
shows
Master
Legend
receiving
a
certificate
of
recognition
from
a
police
officer

ALSO
ADDED
RLSHs
tell
me
that
Master
Legend
helped
Florida
residents
in
the
aftermath
of
Hurricane
Charly
He
helped
cut
apart
trees
on
roads
so
relief
trucks
and
traffic
can
get
through

He
was
also
pulling
people
out
of
their
houses
who
were
trapped

ANTI
LEGEND
Tales
of
Comic
Book
Bravado
and
Crimefighting
The
very
thing
that
appeals
to
some
people
about
Master
Legend
is
what
others
use
as
a
criticism
his
storytelling

Many
of
his
claims
have
no
documentation
and
are
outlandish

For
example
in
his
article
Joshuah
Bearman
writes
about
how
Master
legend
and
Justice
Force
a
pre
Team
Justice
had
a
mission
to
put
the
stomp
on
a
child
molester
and
his
gang
of
crackheads

Master
Legend
has
many
more
florid
tales
of
adventure
some
plausible
like
retrieving
a
friend
s
stolen
money
others
quite
outlandish
like
the
child
molester
and
his
gang
of
crackheads

For
starters
doesn
t
it
seem
like
you
d
have
to
be
one
charismatic
child
molester
to
attract
an
entire
gang
of
crackheads
to
do
your
bidding
The
Legend
of
Master
Legend
by
Joshuah
Bearman
Rolling
Stone
Jan

In
another
blog
entry
Master
Legend
himself
describes
a
confrontation
he
has
in
an
alleyway
with
three
criminals
he
encounters
while
give
a
homeless
man
blankets

After
engaging
them
in
combat
he
writes
about
how
he
wins
the
back
alley
brawl
I
then
see
the
first
guy
back
at
me
so
I
throw
a
drop
kick
on
him

I
then
take
off
my
helmet
and
bash
him
in
the
head
with
it
by
this
time
they
hear
the
Legend
yell
as
I
go
into
Fist
City
mode

The
one
guy
s
head
is
bleeding
and
he
staggers
off
as
the
other
two
are
back
on
me

I
still
use
my
helmet
as
my
weapon

Then
one
whips
out
a
knife
so
I
quickly
reach
into
my
utility
belt
and
grab
a
habanero
pepper

I
quickly
chew
it
up
while
backing
off
then
I
snap
kick
the
first
one
that
charged

The
guy
with
the
knife
slashes
at
me
and
I
spit
the
pepper
in
his
eyes

He
hits
the
ground
screaming
I
turn
around
and
laid
out
about
punches
on
the
other
guy

Then
ran
back
over
to
the
guy
with
the
knife
and
stomped
it
out
his
hand
and
even
sprained
my
foot
kicking
him
into
the
brick
wall

Fist
City
in
the
Scummy
Alleyway
Jan

MySpace
blog
He
goes
on
to
say
that
he
flees
the
scene
when
someone
comes
across
it
and
says
they
are
calling
the
cops

Master
Legend
says
call
them
and
gives
the
person
his
card
before
heading
to
a
pizza
joint
and
ordering
pizza
and
beer

The
police
show
up
there
and
basically
tell
him
to
keep
up
the
good
work

So
Master
Legend
triumphs
over
three
armed
street
hoods
using
his
WWII
helmet
and
habanero
pepper
he
has
tucked
in
his
utility
belt

Do
I
have
evidence
this
story
is
false
No
I
don
t

But
I
will
say
if
I
tried
to
file
this
story
as
factual
I
can
tell
you
my
editors
most
likely
would


Check
the
calendar
to
see
if
it
was
April



Tell
me
to
get
out
of
their
office
possibly
permanently

Claims
of
Metaphysical
and
Religious
Powers
Master
Legend
has
claimed
to
have
various
metaphysical
and
voodoo
based
powers

From
the
about
me
section
of
his
MySpace
I
am
a
real
life
super
hero
born
with
a
purple
veil
and
certain
psychic
abilities
and
gifted
with
powers
by
a
voodoo
queen

I
am
here
to
help
you
and
will
put
my
life
on
the
line
to
do
so

Never
hesitate
to
ask
for
my
advice
or
for
me
to
use
my
powers
to
help
you

MySpace
In
January
Master
Legend
posted
a
message
that
he
was
the
archangel
Metatron

It
first
appeared
at
the
Heroes
Network
which
led
to
him
being
banned
from
that
forum

Here
is
the
post
in
question
I
the
arch
angel
Metatron
am
taking
prayer
requests

Do
not
be
afraid
and
let
me
cast
away
demons
and
ailments
in
your
life

God
has
told
me
I
can
do
this
at
this
time
so
come
to
me
with
your
troubles
and
I
will
help
and
it
doesn
t
matter
who
you
are

January
Anti
Homosexual
Comments
Master
Legend
has
received
some
controversy
from
statements
he
s
made
regarding
homosexuals

For
instance
on
March
Atavistik
a
RLSH
from
Northern
California
posted
a
thread
titled
RLSHSF
Meet
at
Pride
Festival
at
therlsh
net

He
suggested
that
RLSHs
in
Northern
California
meet
up
for
San
Francisco
s
Gay
Pride
Fest

Master
Legend
responded
to
the
thread
Do
you
not
see
this
is
like
a
gateway
drug
to
even
worst
sic
immorality
I
tell
you
this
because
I
care
and
I
can
rest
easy
knowing
I
tried
to
warn
you

I
don
t
care
if
people
want
to
hate
me
for
being
a
man
of
the
bible
but
the
bible
is
not
all
my
reason

Can
you
not
see
the
sickness
that
leads
to
death
This
is
just
horrible

You
want
to
praise
disgust
and
evil
and
call
it
freedom
What
s
next
child
molester
pride
day
Hey
it
s
freedom
so
that
gives
me
the
freedom
to
say
the
truth

I
don
t
feel
sorry
for
them
or
praise
this

I
also
have
the
freedom
to
destroy
this
evil

I
cannot
believe
that
this
is
not
seen

March
Allegations
of
Alcohol
Abuse
By
this
I
m
not
talking
about
the
fact
the
Master
Legend
drinks
in
the
comfort
of
Legend
Tower

Many
people
of
all
professions
drink
police
officers
doctors
ditch
diggers
even
RLSH
bloggers

The
allegations
I
am
talking
about
are
Master
Legend
drinking
and
then
going
on
patrol
or
driving
the
Justice
Van

I
want
to
be
very
clear
I
have
no
evidence
that
will
back
such
an
allegation
up
and
will
give
full
benefit
of
the
doubt
that
these
allegations
are
false
until
I
see
proof
otherwise

The
reason
it
has
made
this
list
is
that
I
have
heard
these
allegations
not
once
but
several
times

WELCOME
TO
HEROES
IN
THE
NIGHT
My
name
is
Tea
Krulos
and
I
m
a
freelance
writer
from
Milwaukee
Wisconsin

I
was
introduced
to
the
Real
Life
Super
Hero
RLSH
story
in
late
February


As
a
lifelong
fan
of
comic
books
and
unusual
and
unique
people
and
subcultures
I
was
immediately
hooked

I
was
determined
to
find
a
local
RLSH
if
there
was
one
and
found
The
Watchman
a
man
who
dons
a
red
rubber
mask
suit
and
trenchcoat
and
patrols
the
streets
of
Milwaukee

I
had
a
long
fascinating
interview
with
him
in
person
one
night
and
determined
that
the
short
magazine
piece
I
had
successfully
pitched
did
not
scratch
the
surface
of
the
story
and
decided
to
write
a
book

After
a
few
months
I
also
established
this
blog
both
the
book
and
the
blog
are
titled
Heroes
in
the
Night

My
book
is
based
on
extensive
research
interviewing
and
field
work

I
have
traveled
to
meet
RLSH
in
Minneapolis
Rochester
Minnesota
Brooklyn
Vancouver
Portland
Seattle
San
Diego
New
Bedford
Massachusetts
and
Washington
DC
as
well
as
meeting
regularly
with
the
Milwaukee
crew

I
have
been
quoted
as
an
expert
on
the
subject
in
the
New
York
Times
Wall
Street
Journal
People
magazine
Seattle
Weekly
Scientific
American
io

com
Milwaukee
Journal
Sentinel
and
dozens
of
other
newspapers
magazines
websites
around
the
world

I
ve
also
made
appearances
on
a
dozen
radio
shows
and
have
been
filmed
for
three
different
RLSH
documentaries

I
have
written
articles
on
the
subject
for
Milwaukee
magazine

Boston
Phoenix

Urban
legend
v
t
e
Urban
legends
sometimes
modern
legend
urban
myth
or
simply
legend
is
a
genre
of
folklore
concerning
stories
about
an
unusual
usually
scary
or
humorous
event
that
many
people
believe
to
be
true
but
largely
are
not

These
legends
can
be
entertaining
but
often
concern
mysterious
peril
or
troubling
events
such
as
disappearances
and
strange
objects
or
entities

Urban
legends
may
confirm
moral
standards
reflect
prejudices
or
be
a
way
to
make
sense
of
societal
anxieties

In
the
past
urban
legends
were
most
often
circulated
orally
at
gatherings
and
around
the
campfire
for
instance

Now
they
can
be
spread
by
any
media
including
newspapers
mobile
news
apps
e
mail
and
most
often
social
media

Some
urban
legends
have
passed
through
the
years
decades
with
only
minor
changes
in
where
the
time
period
takes
place

Generic
urban
legends
are
often
altered
to
suit
regional
variations
but
the
lesson
or
moral
generally
remains
the
same

Origin
and
structure
edit
The
term
urban
legend
as
used
by
folklorists
has
appeared
in
print
since
at
least
when
it
was
used
by
Richard
Dorson

Jan
Harold
Brunvand
professor
of
English
at
the
University
of
Utah
introduced
the
term
to
the
general
public
in
a
series
of
popular
books
published
beginning
in


Brunvand
used
his
collection
of
legends
The
Vanishing
Hitchhiker
American
Urban
Legends
Their
Meanings
to
make
two
points
first
that
legends
and
folklore
do
not
occur
exclusively
in
so
called
primitive
or
traditional
societies
and
second
that
one
could
learn
much
about
urban
and
modern
culture
by
studying
such
tales

Many
urban
legends
are
framed
as
complete
stories
with
plot
and
characters

The
compelling
appeal
of
a
typical
urban
legend
is
its
elements
of
mystery
horror
fear
or
humor

Often
they
serve
as
cautionary
tales

Some
urban
legends
are
morality
tales
that
depict
someone
acting
in
a
disagreeable
manner
only
to
wind
up
in
trouble
hurt
or
dead

Urban
legends
will
often
try
to
invoke
a
feeling
of
disgust
in
the
reader
which
tends
to
make
these
stories
more
memorable
and
potent

Elements
of
shock
value
can
be
found
in
almost
every
form
of
urban
legend
and
are
partially
what
makes
these
tales
so
impactful

An
urban
legend
may
include
elements
of
the
supernatural
or
paranormal

Propagation
and
belief
edit
As
Jan
Brunvand
points
out
antecedent
legends
including
some
of
the
motifs
themes
and
symbolism
of
the
urtexts
can
readily
be
identified

Cases
that
may
have
been
at
least
partially
inspired
by
real
events
include
The
Death
Car
traced
by
Richard
Dorson
to
Michigan
United
States
the
Solid
Cement
Cadillac
and
the
possible
origin
of
The
Hook
in
the
series
of
Lovers
Lane
murders
in
Texarkana
Texas
United
States

The
urban
legend
that
Coca
Cola
developed
the
drink
Fanta
to
sell
in
Nazi
Germany
without
public
backlash
originated
as
the
actual
tale
of
German
Max
Keith
who
invented
the
drink
and
ran
Coca
Cola
s
operations
in
Germany
during
World
War
II

The
narrator
of
an
urban
legend
may
claim
it
happened
to
a
friend
or
to
a
friend
of
a
friend
which
serves
to
personalize
authenticate
and
enhance
the
power
of
the
narrative
while
distancing
the
teller
from
the
tall
tale

Many
urban
legends
depict
horrific
crimes
contaminated
foods
or
other
situations
that
would
potentially
affect
many
people

Anyone
believing
such
stories
might
feel
compelled
to
warn
loved
ones

On
occasion
news
organizations
school
officials
and
even
police
departments
have
issued
warnings
concerning
the
latest
threat

According
to
the
Lights
Out
rumor
street
gang
members
would
drive
without
headlights
until
a
compassionate
motorist
responded
with
the
traditional
flashing
of
headlights
whereupon
a
prospective
new
gang
member
would
have
to
murder
the
citizen
as
a
requirement
of
initiation

A
fax
retelling
this
legend
received
at
the
Nassau
County
Florida
fire
department
was
forwarded
to
police
and
from
there
to
all
city
departments

The
Minister
of
Defence
for
Canada
was
taken
in
by
it
also
he
forwarded
an
urgent
security
warning
to
all
Ontario
Members
of
Parliament

Urban
legends
typically
include
common
elements
the
tale
is
retold
on
behalf
of
the
original
witness
or
participant
dire
warnings
are
often
given
for
those
who
might
not
heed
the
advice
or
lesson
contained
therein
a
typical
element
of
many
e
mail
phishing
scams
and
the
tale
is
often
touted
as
something
a
friend
told
me
the
friend
being
identified
by
first
name
only
or
not
identified
at
all

Such
legends
seem
to
be
believable
and
even
provocative
as
some
readers
are
led
in
turn
to
pass
them
on
including
on
social
media
platforms
that
instantly
reach
millions
worldwide

Many
are
essentially
extended
jokes
told
as
if
they
were
true
events

Persistent
urban
legends
do
often
maintain
a
degree
of
plausibility
as
in
the
story
a
serial
killer
deliberately
hiding
in
the
back
seat
of
a
car

Another
such
example
since
the
s
has
been
the
recurring
rumor
that
the
Procter
Gamble
Company
was
associated
with
Satan
worshippers
because
of
details
within
its
th
century
trademark

The
legend
interrupted
the
company
s
business
to
the
point
that
it
stopped
using
the
trademark

Relation
to
mythology
edit
The
earliest
term
by
which
these
narratives
were
known
urban
belief
tales
highlights
what
was
then
thought
of
as
a
key
property
their
tellers
regarded
the
stories
as
true
accounts
and
the
device
of
the
FOAF
acronym
for
Friend
of
a
Friend
invented
by
English
writer
and
folklorist
Rodney
Dale
in
was
a
spurious
but
significant
effort
at
authentication

The
coinage
leads
in
turn
to
the
terms
FOAFlore
and
FOAFtale


While
at
least
one
classic
legend
the
Death
Car
has
been
shown
to
have
some
basis
in
fact
folklorists
have
an
interest
in
debunking
those
narratives
only
to
the
degree
that
establishing
non
factuality
warrants
the
assumption
that
there
must
be
some
other
reason
why
the
tales
are
told
re
told
and
believed

As
in
the
case
of
myth
the
narratives
are
believed
because
they
construct
and
reinforce
the
worldview
of
the
group
within
which
they
are
told
or
because
they
provide
us
with
coherent
and
convincing
explanations
of
complex
events


Social
scientists
have
started
to
draw
on
urban
legends
in
order
to
help
explain
complex
socio
psychological
beliefs
such
as
attitudes
to
crime
childcare
fast
food
SUVs
and
other
family
choices

The
authors
make
an
explicit
connection
between
urban
legends
and
popular
folklore
such
as
Grimm
s
Fairy
Tales
where
similar
themes
and
motifs
arise

For
that
reason
it
is
characteristic
of
groups
within
which
a
given
narrative
circulates
to
vehemently
reject
claims
or
demonstrations
of
non
factuality
an
example
would
be
the
expressions
of
outrage
by
police
officers
who
are
told
that
adulteration
of
Halloween
treats
by
strangers
the
subject
of
periodic
moral
panics
occurs
extremely
rarely
if
at
all

Documentation
edit
The
Internet
has
made
it
easier
both
to
spread
and
to
debunk
urban
legends

For
instance
the
Usenet
newsgroup
alt
folklore
urban
and
several
other
websites
most
notably
snopes
com
focus
on
discussing
tracking
and
analyzing
urban
legends

The
United
States
Department
of
Energy
had
a
now
discontinued
service
called
Hoaxbusters
that
dealt
with
computer
distributed
hoaxes
and
legends

The
most
notable
such
hoaxes
are
known
as
creepypastas
which
are
typically
horror
stories
written
anonymously

Although
most
are
regarded
as
obviously
false
some
such
as
the
Slender
Man
have
gained
a
following
of
people
that
do
believe
in
them

Television
shows
such
as
Urban
Legends
Beyond
Belief
Fact
or
Fiction
and
later
Mostly
True
Stories
Urban
Legends
Revealed
feature
re
enactments
of
urban
legends
detailing
the
accounts
of
the
tales
and
typically
later
in
an
episode
revealing
any
factual
basis
they
may
have

The
Discovery
Channel
TV
show
MythBusters
tried
to
prove
or
disprove
several
urban
legends
by
attempting
to
reproduce
them
using
the
scientific
method

The
film
Urban
Legend
featured
students
discussing
popular
urban
legends
while
at
the
same
time
falling
victim
to
killings
re
enacting
them

The
film
The
Blair
Witch
Project
purposefully
positioned
itself
as
an
urban
legend
to
gain
viral
hype
and
succeeded
in
fooling
many
that
it
was
based
on
a
real
disappearance

The
lack
of
widespread
social
media
and
search
engines
helped
it
proliferate
in
the
months
leading
up
to
its
release

Between
and
The
Guardian
newspaper
Weekend
section
published
the
illustrated
Urban
Myths
column
by
Phil
Healey
and
Rick
Glanvill
with
content
taken
from
a
series
of
four
books
Urban
Myths
The
Return
of
Urban
Myths
Urban
Myths
Unplugged
and
Now
That
s
What
I
Call
Urban
Myths

The
comics
anthology
the
Big
Book
of
Urban
Legends
written
by
Robert
Boyd
Jan
Harold
Brunvand
and
Robert
Loren
Fleming
featured
urban
legends
displayed
as
comics

citation

The
British
writer
Tony
Barrell
has
explored
urban
legends
in
a
long
running
column
in
The
Sunday
Times

These
include
the
story
that
Orson
Welles
began
work
on
a
Batman
movie
in
the
s
which
was
to
feature
James
Cagney
as
the
Riddler
and
Marlene
Dietrich
as
Catwoman
the
persistent
rumour
that
the
rock
singer
Courtney
Love
is
the
granddaughter
of
Marlon
Brando
and
the
idea
that
a
famous
s
poster
of
Farrah
Fawcett
contains
a
subliminal
sexual
message
concealed
in
the
actress
s
hair

Genres
edit
Crime
edit
As
with
traditional
urban
legends
many
internet
rumors
are
about
crimes
or
crime
waves
either
fictional
or
based
on
real
events
that
have
been
largely
exaggerated

Such
stories
can
be
problematic
both
because
they
purport
to
be
relevant
modern
news
and
because
they
do
not
follow
the
typical
patterns
of
urban
legends

Medicine
edit
Some
legends
are
medical
folklore
such
as
the
claim
that
eating
watermelon
seeds
will
result
in
a
watermelon
growing
in
the
stomach
or
that
going
outdoors
just
after
showering
will
result
in
catching
a
cold

Many
old
wives
tales
have
grown
around
the
identification
of
ailments
real
and
imagined
and
the
recommended
remedies
rituals
and
home
grown
medical
treatments
to
treat
them

citation
needed
Internet
edit
Internet
urban
legends
are
those
spread
through
the
internet
as
through
Usenet
or
email
or
more
recently
through
other
social
media

They
can
also
be
linked
to
viral
online
content

Some
take
the
form
of
chain
letters
and
spread
by
e
mail
directing
the
reader
to
share
them
or
to
meet
a
terrible
fate
and
following
a
recognizable
outline
of
hook
threat
and
finally
request

Paranormal
edit
Paranormal
urban
legend
stories
usually
involve
someone
encountering
something
supernatural
such
as
a
cryptid
for
instance
Bigfoot
or
Mothman
legendary
creatures
for
which
evidence
is
lacking
but
which
have
legions
of
believers

Research
shows
that
people
experiencing
sudden
or
surprising
events
such
as
a
Bigfoot
sighting
may
significantly
overestimate
the
duration
of
the
event

Marketing
edit
Companies
have
been
accused
of
hiding
secret
messages
behind
their
logos
or
packaging
as
in
the
case
of
the
old
Procter
Gamble
symbol
supposedly
an
occult
figure
that
gave
panache
to
the
brand

If
the
thirteen
stars
in
the
symbol
were
connected
a
certain
way
it
would
show
three
sixes
in
a
row
or
looked
at
the
curls
at
the
bottom
they
form
the
inverted
s

Similarly
a
video
of
a
Christian
woman
exposing
Monster
Energy
for
using
the
Hebrew
letter
vav
forming
the
letter
M
to
disguise
the
number
went
viral
on
Facebook

In
this
painting
of
Lady
Godiva
by
John
Collier
the
authentic
historical
person
is
fully
submerged
in
the
legend
presented
in
an
anachronistic
high
medieval
setting

A
legend
is
a
genre
of
folklore
that
consists
of
a
narrative
featuring
human
actions
believed
or
perceived
to
have
taken
place
in
human
history

Narratives
in
this
genre
may
demonstrate
human
values
and
possess
certain
qualities
that
give
the
tale
verisimilitude

Legend
for
its
active
and
passive
participants
may
include
miracles

Legends
may
be
transformed
over
time
to
keep
them
fresh
and
vital

Many
legends
operate
within
the
realm
of
uncertainty
never
being
entirely
believed
by
the
participants
but
also
never
being
resolutely
doubted

Legends
are
sometimes
distinguished
from
myths
in
that
they
concern
human
beings
as
the
main
characters
and
do
not
necessarily
have
supernatural
origins
and
sometimes
in
that
they
have
some
sort
of
historical
basis
whereas
myths
generally
do
not

The
Brothers
Grimm
defined
legend
as
folktale
historically
grounded


A
by
product
of
the
concern
with
human
beings
is
the
long
list
of
legendary
creatures
leaving
no
resolute
doubt
that
legends
are
historically
grounded

A
modern
folklorist
s
professional
definition
of
legend
was
proposed
by
Timothy
R

Tangherlini
in
Legend
typically
is
a
short
mono
episodic
traditional
highly
ecotypified
historicized
narrative
performed
in
a
conversational
mode
reflecting
on
a
psychological
level
a
symbolic
representation
of
folk
belief
and
collective
experiences
and
serving
as
a
reaffirmation
of
commonly
held
values
of
the
group
to
whose
tradition
it
belongs

Etymology
and
origin
edit

Holger
danske

Holger
Danske
a
legendary
character
Legend
is
a
loanword
from
Old
French
that
entered
English
usage
c



The
Old
French
noun
legende
derives
from
the
Medieval
Latin
legenda

In
its
early
English
language
usage
the
word
indicated
a
narrative
of
an
event

The
word
legendary
was
originally
a
noun
introduced
in
the
s
meaning
a
collection
or
corpus
of
legends

This
word
changed
to
legendry
and
legendary
became
the
adjectival
form

By
English
speaking
Protestants
began
to
use
the
word
when
they
wished
to
imply
that
an
event
especially
the
story
of
any
saint
not
acknowledged
in
John
Foxe
s
Actes
and
Monuments
was
fictitious

Thus
legend
gained
its
modern
connotations
of
undocumented
and
spurious
which
distinguish
it
from
the
meaning
of
chronicle

In
Jacob
Grimm
described
the
fairy
tale
as
poetic
legend
historic

Early
scholars
such
as
Karl
Wehrhan
de
Friedrich
Ranke
and
Will
Erich
Peuckert
followed
Grimm
s
example
in
focussing
solely
on
the
literary
narrative
an
approach
that
was
enriched
particularly
after
the
s
by
addressing
questions
of
performance
and
the
anthropological
and
psychological
insights
provided
in
considering
legends
social
context

Questions
of
categorising
legends
in
hopes
of
compiling
a
content
based
series
of
categories
on
the
line
of
the
Aarne
Thompson
folktale
index
provoked
a
search
for
a
broader
new
synthesis

In
an
early
attempt
at
defining
some
basic
questions
operative
in
examining
folk
tales
Friedrich
Ranke
de
in
characterised
the
folk
legend
as
a
popular
narrative
with
an
objectively
untrue
imaginary
content
a
dismissive
position
that
was
subsequently
largely
abandoned

Compared
to
the
highly
structured
folktale
legend
is
comparatively
amorphous
Helmut
de
Boor
noted
in


The
narrative
content
of
legend
is
in
realistic
mode
rather
than
the
wry
irony
of
folktale
Wilhelm
Heiske
remarked
on
the
similarity
of
motifs
in
legend
and
folktale
and
concluded
that
in
spite
of
its
realistic
mode
legend
is
not
more
historical
than
folktale

In
Einleitung
in
der
Geschichtswissenschaft
Ernst
Bernheim
asserted
that
a
legend
is
simply
a
longstanding
rumour

Gordon
Allport
credited
the
staying
power
of
some
rumours
to
the
persistent
cultural
state
of
mind
that
they
embody
and
capsulise
thus
Urban
legends
are
a
feature
of
rumour

When
Willian
Hugh
Jansen
suggested
that
legends
that
disappear
quickly
were
short
term
legends
and
the
persistent
ones
be
termed
long
term
legends
the
distinction
between
legend
and
rumour
was
effectively
obliterated
Tangherlini
concluded

Christian
legenda
edit
Main
article
Legendary
hagiography
In
a
narrow
Christian
sense
legenda
things
to
be
read
on
a
certain
day
in
church
were
hagiographical
accounts
often
collected
in
a
legendary

Because
saints
lives
are
often
included
in
many
miracle
stories
legend
in
a
wider
sense
came
to
refer
to
any
story
that
is
set
in
a
historical
context
but
that
contains
supernatural
divine
or
fantastic
elements

Oral
tradition

Main
article
Oral

History

through

often
takes

a

oral
traditions
of
the
African
Great

necessity

It
refers
imaginary

it
localizes
romantic
stories

spot

From
the
moment
a
legend
is
retold
as
fiction
its
authentic
legendary
qualities
begin

recede

Sleepy
Hollow
Washington
Irving
transformed
a
local
Hudson
River
Valley
legend
into
a
literary
anecdote
with
Gothic
overtones
which
actually
tended
to
diminish
its
character
as
genuine
legend

Stories
that
exceed
the
boundaries
of
realism
are
called
fables


For
example
the
talking
animal
formula
of
Aesop
identifies
his
brief
stories
as
fables
and
not
legends

The
parable
of
the
Prodigal
Son
would
be
a
legend
if
it
were
told
as
having
actually
happened
to
a
specific
son
of
a
historical
father

If
it
included
a
donkey
that
gave
sage
advice
to
the
Prodigal
Son
it
would
be
a
fable

Urban
legends
are
a
modern
genre
of
folklore
that
is
rooted
in
local
popular
culture
usually
comprising
fictional
stories
that
are
often
presented
as
true
with
macabre
or
humorous
elements

These
legends
can
be
used
for
entertainment
purposes
as
well
as
semi
serious
explanations
for
seemingly
mysterious
events
such
as
disappearances
and
strange
objects

The
term
urban
legend
as
generally
used
by
folklorists
has
appeared
in
print
since
at
least


Jan
Harold
Brunvand
professor
of
English
at
the
University
of
Utah
introduced
the
term
to
the
general
public
in
a
series
of
popular
books
published
beginning
in


Brunvand
used
his
collection
of
legends
The
Vanishing
Hitchhiker
American
Urban
Legends
Their
Meanings
to
make
two
points
first
that
legends
and
folklore
do
not
occur
exclusively
in
so
called
primitive
or
traditional
societies
and
second
that
one
could
learn
much
about
urban
and
modern
culture
by
studying
such
tales

a

Their

characters
are
not

but
they
often
have
human
attributes
they
are
animals

heroes
whose
actions
are
set

world
when
the
earth
was
different
from
what
it
is
today
or
in
another
world
such

are

The

That

He

Except
what
about
Serena

Winner
of
Grand

titles
the
Serena
Slam
holding
all
four
major
titles
at
the

time
and
four
Olympic

And
she
got
her
final
Grand

event
win
while
pregnant
putting
her
career
on
hold
while
she
was
at
her
most
dominant

Except
if
you
are
going
to
pick
a
tennis
player
what
about
Roger
Federer
He
transformed
an
entire
sport
with
his
artistry
his
chess
game
on
the
court
his
blazing
forehand

He
won
Grand
Slam
titles
and
became
the
most
beloved
tennis
player
of
all
time

Gotta
be
Fed

Yeah
except
Rafael
Nadal
won
Grand

titles
and
Novak
Djokovic
has
won


You
have
to
pick
one
of
them
over
Federer

Hmm

Maybe
this
isn
t
so
easy

We
didn
t
even
mention
the
Olympians
Usain
Bolt
and
Michael

and
Katie

and

Or
Kobe

Gotta
throw
Kobe

Geez
almost

Yes
ranking
the
top
most
accomplished
athletes
since
wasn
t
quite
so
easy
after
all
but
it
sure
was
fun

Twenty
five
years
ago
the
ESPN
SportsCentury
project
ranked
the
top
North
American
athletes
of
the
th
century

Michael
Jordan
came
in
first
followed
by
Babe
Ruth
Muhammad
Ali
Jim
Brown
and
Wayne
Gretzky

Ruth
should
have
been
No

but
hey
I
m
a

We
also
ranked

Secretariat

No

With
so
many
transcendent
athletes
over
the
past
years
we
thought
it
was
time
to
do
another
ranking

I
promise
you
there
are
no
horses
this
time
sorry
American
Pharoah


In
considering
the
best
athletes
of
the
st
century
however
we
have
expanded
our
choices
beyond
North
America

ESPN
editions
from
around
the
globe
contributed
to
the
nominations
and
voting
process
as
well
as
the
individual
sport
list
rankings
that
will
follow

Voters
were
instructed
to
consider
only
an
athlete
s
performance
since


So
for
Barry
Bonds
He
won
seven
MVP
awards
but
only
four
of
those
came
after
as
did
of
his
home
runs

Or
Ken
Griffey
Jr

He
played
until
but
all
of
his
best
seasons
came
in
the
s

Tiger
won
of
his
majors
from
on
so
he
s
in
good
shape

Other
athletes
such
as
Patrick
Mahomes
or
Nikola
Jokic
or
Shohei
Ohtani
obviously
have
more
greatness
ahead
of
them
so
we
ll
see
how
high
their
accomplishments
so
far
get
them
on
the
list

In
the
end
we
received
more

There
is
little
that
Williams
didn

achieve
during
her
record
setting
career
including
winning
major
titles

But
it
might
have
been
her
last
one
that
was
the
most
improbable

She
needed
to
win
one
more
Grand
Slam
to
break
the
tie
with
Steffi
Graf
for
most
in
the
Open
era
which
began
in
a
mark
Williams
said
she
had
been
chasing
for
a
really
long
time
and
remained
in
the
Australian
Open
draw
even
after
finding
out
she
was
pregnant
shortly
before
competition
began

She
was
in
peak
Serena
form
never
dropping
a
set
en
route
to
a
final
showdown
with
her
sister
Venus

She
defeated
Venus
to
take
sole
ownership
of
the
record

Williams
played
in
four
more
major
finals
after
her
return
from
maternity
leave
and
a
complicated
childbirth

She
didn
t
win
another
title

The
way
I
see
it
I
should
have
had
plus
Grand
Slams
Williams
wrote
in
Vogue
in
a
essay
announcing
her
impending
retirement

I
didn
t
get
there




But
I
showed
up
times
and
that

fine

After
losing

it
looked
like
it
would
never
happen
for
Messi
who
had
won
everything
else
in
the
game
for

and
country
but
the
crowning
moment
of
his
career
finally
arrived
at
age

scored
twice
in

The
special
game
happened
years

this

That

scored

for
the
Cleveland
Cavaliers
in
a
double
overtime
upset
Game
road
win
against
the
Detroit
Pistons
in

Eastern
Conference
finals

The
point
game
was
a
mesmerizing
performance
that
stands
as
one
of
the
classic
games
of
this
century




and
it
probably
doesn
t
even
rank
in
the
top
of
James
playoff
performances

It
might
not
be
one
of
his
top
three
conference

games

This
is
what
James
greatness
rests
on
No
one
has
ever
been
this
good
for
this

That
long
ago
night
in
the
Palace
of
Auburn
Hills
is
merely
one
of
point
games
James
has
in
the
playoffs
alone

That
win
paved
the
way
to
his
first
Finals
starting
a
run
of
appearances
in
years

During
that
stretch
he
won
four
NBA
titles
four
MVPs
and
four
Finals
MVPs
with
three
different
teams
as
well
as
two
Olympic
gold
medals

He
also
won
at
least
one
road
game
in
consecutive
playoff
series

He
has
scored
in
double
figures
in

games

When

was
his

he
was
fond
of
answering
The

That
sums
up
the
player
whom
Bill
Belichick
referred
to
as
the
ultimate
winner
who
often
played
his
best
when
the
stakes
were
highest

Belichick
noted
how
Brady
entered
the
NFL
as
a
sixth
round
pick
with
little
to
no
fanfare
and
left
as
the
most
successful
player
in
league
history

Said
Belichick
His
relentless
pursuit
of
excellence
drove
him
on
a

His
work
ethic
and
desire
to
win
were
both
motivational
and

to
teammates

Trout
leaped

As
perhaps
the
first

whose
greatness
was
sharpened
by

Trout
s

was
on

from

Injuries
have
slowed

but
if
Trout
can
string
together
a

more

campaigns
the
kid
from
Millville

could
yet
transcend
his

run


points
and


rebounds
on

and

to
lead
the

to
the

legendary

In

before
James
arrived
in

Wade
won
the
scoring
title
and
twice
finished
in
the
top
five
of

He
willingly
took
a
step
back
for
James
an
act
that
undoubtedly
helped
the

jell
and
win
back
to
back
titles
even
if
it
meant
the
end
of
his
time
at
the

of
those

It
was
a
team
first
act
he
paired
with
a
willingness
to
come
off
the
bench
in
the
Olympics
for
the
Redeem

He
still
stands
as
one
of

the

The

new

express
Hey

NASCAR

and
Dale
Earnhardt
including
five
in
a
row
a
mark
of
which
The
King
and
The
Intimidator
never
came
close

But
Johnson
s
most
mind
bending
accomplishment
is
that
he
won
those
Cups
even
as
the
system
that
awarded
them
was
seemingly
and
repeatedly
rigged
against
him

The
paddock
called
it
Jimmie
Proofing
as
his
septet
of

were
earned
via
three
different
points
systems
and
four
postseason
format
variations
all
while
steering
three
wildly
different
generations
of
race
cars

Meanwhile
he
somehow
has
remained
true
to
his
SoCal

Before

as

there

The
lore
of
Beltre
has
grown
since
his
retirement
following
the
season
and
placed
him
alongside
Mike
Schmidt
and
Brooks
Robinson
among
the
game
s
best
third
basemen

No
one
at
third
played
more
games
than
Beltre
a
testament
to
his
willingness
to
grit
through
pain

He
manned
the
position
with
grace
and
consistency
two
tenets
that
apply
to
the
rest
of
his
game

Beltre
s
counting
stats
never
screamed

he
never
won
an

and
his
allergy
to

limited
his

There

Even

up
in

areas
the
pure
power
behind
his

shot
remains

Ovechkin
s
success
scoring

to

has
come
in
large
part
because
of
how
he
uses
a
big
frame

to
add
velocity
and
power
behind
a
shot
that
can
exceed

When
Ovechkin
puts

particularly
from

it
s
a

In

he

Methodology
Experts
in
individual
sports
were
asked
to
vote
to
rank
the
top
athletes
in
their
sport
since
Jan

no
accomplishments
before
this
date
were
to
be
considered


Those
votes
pared
down
pools
in
each
sport
to
lists
of
to
athletes
each
which
constituted
the
overall
candidate
pool
for
the
top
athletes
of
the
st
century
so
far

Each
voter
was
presented
two
randomly
selected
names
and
asked
to
pick
which
one
has
had
the
better
career
in
the
st
century

Across
repeated
randomized
head
to
head
matchups
more
than
votes
were
cast
at
this
stage
and
using
an
Elo
rating
system
the
list
was
pared
down
from
to


That
list
was
then
evaluated
by
a
panel
of
experts
for
any
inconsistencies
or
oversights
resulting
in
the
top
ranking
seen
here

Anyone
remember
this

I
was
surprised
to
discover
this
it
s
been
almost
years
since
this
show
has
aired
on

and
it
gave
me
nostalgia
vibes
after
watching
a
few
episodes

What
s
sad
is
that
the
show
is
pretty
much
forgotten
there
are
only
a

I
remember
this
show
looked
forward
to
see
the
episode
on
the
durian
which
is
nowhere
to
be
found
online
now

Want
to
write
to
Disney
Channel
Asia
requesting
them
to
put
up
the
episodes
on
its
YouTube
channel
but
I
do
not
know
how
I
would
phrase
it

Here
are
other
episodes
available
online
Taro
Japan
Why
Man
and
Animal
Don
t
Live
Together
Hmong
The
uploader
of
the
Western
Australia
and
Hmong
episodes
Allan
Lau
did
the
music
scoring
for
those
episodes

Probably
he
has
more
if
he
did
the
score
for
the
entire
show

There
is
a
similar
show
by
Disney
Channel
Asia
from
a
few
years
after
this
show
called
Guardians

Each
episodes
featured
a
festival
from
an
Asian
country
with
an
elder
narrating
the
story
and
a
child
participating
in
the
festival

In
the
Philippines
it
was
the
Higantes
that
was
featured

Guardians
is
totally
lost
media
with
no
episodes
online

Or
perhaps
I
did
not
find
hard
enough
If
anyone
wants
to

I
just
found
two
articles
on
this

One
by
Magz
Osborne
on
Variety
com
the
other
is
from
Animated

According
to
the
latter
six
shorts
were
made

I
thought
there
were
more

The
latter
article
also
contained
a
link
to
the
show
s
website

It
s
no
longer
up
but
the
Wayback

was
able
to
save
it

It
s
all
in

But
everything
can
be
saved
from
the
site
by
a
simple

I

Was
looking
for
info
about
the
Philippine
episode
when
I
found
names
of
people
involved
with
the
show

From
a
Philstar
com
a
Philippine
news
site
article
from
August
Walt
Disney
Television
International
Asia
Pacific
WDTVI
AP
received
two
World
Gold
PROMAX
Awards
for
Disney
s
Legends
of
the
Ring
of
Fire
the
first
animated
short
story
series
produced
by
Walt
Disney
Television

Indonesia
s
folktale
Why
the
Sun
Chases
the
Moon
bagged
the
Gold
in
the
category
interstitial
promotainment
Network
or
Block
executive
produced
by
Raymund
Miranda
and
Ashok
Miranda

The
other
Gold
was
for
Malaysia
s
folktale
The
Chengal
Tree
executive
produced
by
Raymund
Miranda
Shawn
Letts
Kelvin
Singh
and
Ashok
Miranda

Legends
of
the
Ring
of
Fire
recounts
stories
from
Asian
folklore
passed
down
from
generation
to
generation

Combining
high
quality
animation
and
memorable
soundtracks
with
the
magic
of
Disney
s
unique
storytelling
style
the
series
captures
the
hearts
and
imagination
of
the
young
and
old

It
features
classic
folktales
from
India
Indonesia
Singapore
Taiwan
Malaysia
Korea
Thailand
and
the
Philippines

WDTVI
AP
s
creative
services
team
headed
by
executive
producer
Natalie
Gee
also
won
a
Silver
PROMAX
Award
for
Promotional
Animation
for
the
Studio
D
opener
and
a
Silver
BDA
Design
Award
for
Interstitial
for
Behind
the
Ears
Lilo
Stitch
Something
Stitch

Both
were
produced
by
Senior
Graphics
Producer
Juddee
Torres

We
are
extremely
pleased
and
honored
to
be
presented
with
these
awards
says
Miranda
who
is
also
the
managing
director

These
awards
are
a
fitting
validation
of
all
the
hard
work
and
talent
that
go
through
the
creation
of
each
Disney
program

We
re
especially
proud
of
Disney
s
Legends
of
the
Ring
of
Fire
as
we
feel
that
it
perfectly
showcases
Asia
s
diverse
colorful
and
historic
cultures
and
traditions
adds
Miranda

I
found
another
article
on
Miranda
from
the
same
site
and
his
LinkedIn
profile

He
s
an
executive
at
ABS
CBN
which
is
facing
challenging
times
right
now

Hence
maybe
now
is
not
the
best
time
to
contact
him

I
also
found
this
forum
post
describing
all
episodes

It
cites
a
now
deleted
forum
post
at
talkdisney
com

The
post
is
available
at
the

and
cites

The

I
cannot
find
The
Jakarta
Post
article
but
it
is
reproduced
in
jawawa
id
which
I
don
t
know
anything
about

If
there
are
Indonesians
here
please
help

Hence
these
descriptions
remain
unverified

In
the
beginning
there
were
nine
suns
scorching
the
Earth

The
Moon
felt
sorry
for
the
people
of
Earth
and
helped
them
trick
the
father
Sun
into
eating
the
other
suns

This
is
the
story
of
Why
the
Sun
Chases
the
Moon
based
on
Indonesian
folklore
for
the
Disney
Channel
series
Legends
of
the
Ring
of
Fire

The
Cengal
Tree
a
tale
from
Malaysia
Premiere
date
Saturday
Aug

Long
long
ago
it
rained
non
stop
such
that
the
earth
was
flooded

The
white
ants
had
to
flee
from
their
homes
to
escape
the
floodwaters

They
appealed
to
the
trees
to
seek
shelter
in
their
branches
but
were
refused
as
the
trees
were
afraid
that
the
white
ants
would
eat
them
later

Finally
they
approached
the
big
Cengal
tree
as
their
last
hope
and
the
Cengal
tree
who
had
a
soft
heart
agreed
and
struck
a
bargain
with
the
white
ants
which
lasts
till
this
day

How
the
Moon
Came
to
be
a
tale
from
Thailand
Premiere
date
Saturday
Sept

Long
long
ago
there
was
a
Sun
King
who
ruled
the
heavens
but
there
was
no
moon
in
the
sky
at
night

One
day
the
Sun
King
say
the
beautiful
daughter
of
the
King
of
Siam
and
fell
in
love
with
her

He
refused
to
go
back
to
his
home
in
the
sky
as
he
wanted
to
stay
by
her
side
constantly
and
night
never
fell
on
earth
again

The
stars
who
were
forced
to
hide
in
the
clouds
decided
on
a
plan
to
bring
back
the
nights
and
in
doing
so
created
the
moon
that
we
see
in
our
skies
to
this
day

How
Singapore
Got
Its
Name
a
tale
from
Singapore
Premiere
date
Saturday
Sept

Long
long
ago
there
was
a
young
adventurous
king
who
loved
to
hunt

One
day
when
he
was
in
the
jungle
hunting
for
stags
he
came
a
cross
a
beautiful
island

Eager
to
explore
it
he
set
sail
immediately
and
encountered
the
fury
of
the
Sea
King

Upon
landing
safely
on
the
island
a
majestic
lion
like
creature
appeared
from
the
jungle
and
gave
the
king
the
inspiration
to
name
the
island
Singapore
which
it
is
still
known
as
to
this
day

The
Magic
Snail
a
tale
from
Korea
Premiere
date
Saturday
Oct

There
once
was
a
young
hardworking
farmer
who
longed
for
a
wife
and
made
a
wish
while
working
in
his
fields

He
heard
a
reply
come
from
a
snail
and
took
the
snail
home
out
of
curiosity

The
snail
transformed
into
a
beautiful
lady
whom
the
farmer
fell
in
love
with
and
they
were
married

One
day
by
chance
the
king
saw
the
beautiful
snail
lady
and
wanted
her
for
himself
so
he
challenged
the
farmer
to
a
test

But
with
the
help
of
his
beautiful
wife
and
the
Dragon
King
the
farmer
was
able
to
overcome
all
obstacles
and
win
back
his
wife

How
the
Durian
Came
to
Be
a
tale
from
the
Philippines
Premiere
date
Saturday
Oct

Long
long
ago
a
powerful
king
ruled
the
Kingdom
of
the
Philippines
but
he
was
sad
as
he
had
a
beautiful
young
wife
who
did
not
love
him

He
decided
to
seek
help
from
a
wise
hermit
who
told
him
how
to
win
his
wife
s
heart
by
planting
a
special
tree

He
succeeded
with
the
help
of
the
nymph
of
the
air
and
held
a
celebration
for
the
entire
kingdom
but
he
forgot
to
invite
the
wise
hermit

In
a
rage
the
hermit
cursed
the
tree
and
created
the
fruit
we
know
as
durian
to
this
day

Based
on
these
descriptions
there
are
still
four
missing
episodes
the
tales
from
Malaysia
Singapore
Korea
and
the
Philippines

Meanwhile
among
the
found
episodes
are
from
Western
Australia
and
Japan

This
means
that
there
are
more
than
six
episodes

Which
means
that
I
was
correct
when
I
said
see
post
above
According
to
the
latter
six
shorts
were
made

I
thought
there
were
more

The
possibility
of
more
episodes
is
not
a
Mandela
effect

How
many
exactly
were
made
I
plan
to
ask
Mr

Miranda
when
the
time
is
right

I
had
never
of
heard
of
this
show
but
the
few
episodes
that
are
availble
seem
great

Haven
t
located
any
other
episodes
but
found
some
additional
links
info

This
forum
thread
that
has
some
assorted
concept
art
including
a
shot
from
The
Magic
Snail
as
well
as
a
link
to
a
now
dead
and
not
waybacked
page
that
stated
the
series
had
a
total
of
eps
so
good
calulation
phlmhunter


IMDB
seeems
to
have
a
stub
article
for
The
Herdsman
and
the
Weaver
that
does
not
associated
it
with
the
larger
series

Of
the
three
names
included
only
writer
Polly
Watkins
has
credits
apart
from
the
short

Another
trail
I
have
found
that
is
already
a
dead
end
is
the
actor
who
voiced
the
narrator
Jim
West
who
passed
away
in
https
voiceactors
wordpress
com
tag
james
robert
west
and
voice

com
jimwest
although
strangely
the
first
link
mentions
an
Emmy
for
the
voice
over
perfomance
that
I
can
t
find
any
proof
of

However
it
appears
he
also
recieved
a
Promax
award

The
only
two
other
major
names
I
have
come
accross
is
the
director
of
Why
the
Sun
Chases
the
Moon
and
the
series
producer
Atul
N
Rao

Another
link
for
Rao
mention
that
he
wrote
and
directed
for
the
series
as
well

A
few
other
minor
players
two
animators
and
an
audio
enginer
include
the
show
in
their
resumes
bios
availble
online
Again
not
sure
if
any
of
this
will
help
but
just
wanted
to
share
what
I
have
found

You
know
this
series
is
obscure
when
googling
Disney
Legends
of
the
Ring
of
Fire
only
has
results
with
the
ommited
simlar
results
active

Thank
you
for
the
additional
info
Amdillae

I
m
hoping
that
they
have
copies
of
the
episodes
they
worked
on
and
that
they
would
be
willing
to
make
them
available
online

If
not
then
at
least
we
can
ask
them
about
their
experiences
in
working
on
the
show

I
ll
contact
them
in
the
far
future
when
I
start
making
my
script
for
this
show
on
my
YouTube
channel

Please
check
it
out

But
if
you
or
someone
else
wants
to
reach
out
to
them
now
feel
free
to
do
so

Thanks
again

July
Saisiat
tale
now
a
cartoon
The
Disney
Channel
will
be
airing
a
five
minute
cartoon
based
on
local
indigenous
folklore
on
Saturday
and
Sunday
at
pm

The
cartoon
The
Lightening
Spirit
s
Daughter
A
Tale
from
Taiwan
is
based
on
a
Saisiat
legend
describing
how
the
Saisiat
people
who
live
in
Miaoli
and
Hsinchu
counties
became
farmers

According
to
the
legend
the
Saisiat
were
hunters

The
lightening
god
saddened
by
the
land
being
left
to
waste
sent
his
daughter
to
the
Earth
where
she
married
a
Saisiat
man
and
taught
the
people
how
to
farm

Although
she
eventually
returned
to
the
heavens
the
Saisiat
honor
her
memory
by
holding
ceremonies
each
year

Disney
is
showing
the
cartoon
as
part
of
its
cartoon
series
Legends
of
the
Ring
of
Fire
which
details
myths
from
Southeast
and
Northeast
Asia

American
Revolution
History
Portrait
of
Thomas
Jefferson
by
Rembrandt
Thomas
Jefferson
President
Fun
Facts
About
Thomas
Jefferson
Born
on
April
Thomas
Jefferson
was
a
leading
figure
in
our
country
s
quest
for
independence

A
native
of
Virginia
Jefferson
also
played
important
roles
in
the
early
history
of
our
fledgling
nation
as
its
Minister
to
France
Secretary
of
State
and
third
President

A
true
Renaissance
man
Jefferson
is
known
for
his
many
talents
in
writing
economics
religion
and
philosophy
as
well
as
horticulture
and
mathematics

He
spoke
languages
including
English
French
Greek
Italian
Latin
and
Spanish

He
also
had
a
love
for
the
written
word
having
written
over
letters
in
his
lifetime

A
Multi
Talented
Thinker
Jefferson
was
an
inventor
lawyer
and
educator

He
graduated
from
the
University
of
William
and
Mary
at
the
age
of
two
years
after
he
enrolled
in


He
was
the
designer
of
Monticello
the
Virginia
State
Capital
and
The
Rotunda
at
the
University
of
Virginia
among
other
notable
buildings

His
influential
style
has
become
known
as
Jeffersonian
Architecture


Monticello
and
The
Rotunda
are
both
World
Heritage
Sites

He
Went
on
a
Hunger
Strike
and
Encouraged
Others
to
Join
Him
As
a
member
of
Virginia
s
House
of
Burgesses
Jefferson
called
for
a
day
of
prayer
and
fasting
in
support
of
the
citizens
of
Boston
when
the
British
government
closed
the
harbor
in
response
to
the
Boston
Tea
Party

As
he
had
hoped
this
action
allied
Virginia
with
the
Patriots
cause
in
Massachusetts
and
fueled
opposition
to
the
Intolerable
Acts

He
Was
the
Major
Pen
of
the
Declaration
of
Independence
At
the
age
of
Thomas
Jefferson
was
one
of
the
youngest
delegates
to
the
Second
Continental
Congress
in
Philadelphia

He
became
acquainted
with
John
Adams
a
leader
of
the
Congress
and
through
this
budding
friendship
Jefferson
was
appointed
to
the
Committee
of
Five
that
was
tasked
with
drafting
the
Declaration
of
Independence

Over
the
next
days
he
would
create
the
first
draft

Jefferson
is
considered
by
many
to
be
the
primary
author
of
the
document
because
the
committee
left
intact
more
than
percent
of
his
original
draft

Many
believed
that
John
Adams
would
be
the
primary
author
of
this
important
document
but
he
had
persuaded
the
Committee
to
choose
Jefferson
instead

The
preamble
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
enduring
statements
of
human
rights
and
the
phrase
all
men
are
created
equal
is
considered
one
of
the
most
well
known
expressions
in
the
English
language

Jefferson
was
an
eloquent
writer
but
did
not
fancy
himself
a
public
speaker
and
chose
to
show
his
support
of
the
Patriot
cause
through
written
correspondence

Writing
to
Justify
the
Actions
of
Discontent
Bostonians
In
Jefferson
penned
a
pamphlet
entitled
A
Summary
View
of
the
Rights
of
British
Americans


In
the
pamphlet
he
outlined
a
set
of
grievances
that
the
colonies
had
against
King
George
III

Jefferson
also
wrote
that
an
exasperated
people
who
felt
oppression
when
given
the
chance
would
act
out
in
defiance

The
perfect
example
of
this
defiance
was
the
destruction
of
the
tea
or
what
would
become
known
as
the
Boston
Tea
Party

Like
his
colleagues
George
Washington
and
Benjamin
Franklin
Jefferson
believed
the
act
was
destruction
of
private
property
subject
to
local
laws
but
his
pamphlet
outlined
why
it
was
justified
as
an
act
of
political
protest

His
Proudest
Moments
Jefferson
s
grave
is
inscribed
with
an
epitaph
of
the
three
things
of
which
he
was
the
proudest

They
are
his
authorship
of
the
Declaration
of
Independence
the
Statute
of
Virginia
that
guaranteed
religious
freedom
and
his
founding
of
the
University
of
Virginia
in


There
is
no
mention
of
him
being
President
on
his
gravestone

A
Family
Man
Jefferson
married
Martha
Wayles
Skelton
a
widow
in


He
fathered
six
children
though
only
two
daughters
survived
to
adulthood

Throughout
his
life
Jefferson
had
twelve
grandchildren
several
of
them
having
lived
with
him
at
Monticello

Jefferson
loved
to
play
with
his
grandchildren
teaching
them
how
to
play
chess
and
a
game
called
Goose

Goose
was
one
of
the
first
board
games
in
the
United
States
rather
similar
to
our
modern
version
of
Chutes
and
Ladders

After
his
wife
died
historians
believe
he
began
a
relationship
with
Sally
Hemings
one
of
his
slaves

After
his
death
Jefferson
s
daughter
allowed
Hemings
to
live
as
a
free
woman
in
Charlottesville
until
she
died
in

A
Controversial
Start
to
His
Presidency
It
was
only
after
the
chaotic
election
of
between
Jefferson
and
John
Adams
that
Congress
decided
to
ratify
the
th
Amendment
to
the
Constitution

The
debacle
occurred
when
Jefferson
received
the
same
number
of
electoral
votes
as
his
running
mate
Aaron
Burr
and
Burr
refused
to
concede
the
election

The
House
of
Representatives
decided
the
election
after
ballots
on
February


They
chose
Jefferson
as
President
and
Burr
as
Vice
President

Landmark
Acquisition
Early
in
his
presidency
Jefferson
was
able
to
achieve
one
of
the
greatest
acquisitions
of
his
political
career
with
the
Louisiana
Purchase
which
more
than
doubled
the
size
of
the
United
States

The
acre
tract
of
land
is
one
of
the
most
fertile
on
Earth
and
eliminated
the
nation
s
reliance
on
other
countries
for
its
food

Jefferson
did
not
believe
the
Constitution
gave
him
the
power
to
make
the
million
land
acquisition
but
agreed
with
Congress
to
make
the
purchase

He
appointed
Meriwether
Lewis
and
William
Clark
to
lead
an
expedition
known
as
the
Corps
of
Discovery
to
explore
the
newly
acquired
territory

Sacagawea
who
both
men
acknowledged
as
providing
an
indispensable
service
accompanied
them
on
the
journey

Lifelong
Connection
After
meeting
at
the
Second
Continental
Congress
in
Thomas
Jefferson
and
John
Adams
became
lifelong
friends

Their
relationship
deepened
through
years
of
letter
writing
including
letters
written
between
Abigail
Adams
and
Jefferson

They
spent
years
in
France
together
as
Jefferson
and
Adams
served
as
trade
ministers
in
Europe

The
two
remained
close
friends
despite
their
political
differences
that
is
until
Jefferson
beat
Adams
in
the
Election
of
to
become
President
of
the
United
States

They
resumed
their
close
friendship
after
about
years
of
separation

Both
Thomas
Jefferson
and
John
Adams
died
on
July
the
th
anniversary
of
the
Declaration
of
Independence

Legend
holds
that
Adams
last
words
were
Thomas
Jefferson
survives

Unbeknownst
to
Adams
Jefferson
had
died
a
few
hours
earlier

They
were
the
last
surviving
members
of
the
original
group
of
Patriots
that
became
known
as
America
s
Founding
Fathers

Jefferson
and
Adams
also
share
the
distinction
of
being
the
only
Declaration
of
Independence
signatories
who
would
later
serve
as
President

He
Lives
On
In
addition
to
the
Jefferson
Memorial
near
the
Tidal
Basin
in
Washington
D
C

he
is
immortalized
on
the
bill
the
nickel
and
as
one
of
the
figures
of
Mount
Rushmore

The
memorial
in
the
nation
s
capital
featuring
a
foot
tall
statue
of
Jefferson
was
dedicated
in
on
the
th
anniversary
of
his
birth

Woodward
right
and
Bernstein
left
became
the
embodiment
of
the
media
myth
about
Watergate
By
Prof
W
Joseph
Campbell
American
University
Washington
DC
The
run
up
to
the
th
anniversary
of
the
Watergate
break
in
the
burglary
that
gave
rise
to
America
s
gravest
political
crisis
has
inevitably
been
accompanied
by
the
mythology
that
has
shaped
and
distorted
popular
understanding
of
the
epic
scandal

The
mythology
is
both
delicious
and
durable
and
revolves
around
the
Washington
Post
and
its
Watergate
reporters
Bob
Woodward
and
Carl
Bernstein

They
are
legends
in
American
journalism
not
only
because
of
their
award
winning
reporting
but
because
of
the
screen
adaptation
of
their
book
about
Watergate
All
the
President
s
Men

The
movie
came
out
in
and
starred
Robert
Redford
as
Woodward
and
Dustin
Hoffman
as
Bernstein

The
New
York
Times
called
it
a
spellbinding
detective
story


And
the
Post
once
described
All
the
President
s
Men
as
the
best
film
ever
made
about
the
craft
of
journalism


It
is
undoubtedly
the
most
viewed
of
the
handful
of
films
and
documentaries
about
Watergate
the
scandal
that
toppled
President
Richard
Nixon
and
sent
to
jail
men
associated
with
his
administration
or
his
re
election
campaign

All
the
President
s
Men
was
more
than
merely
entertaining

It
was
a
vehicle
for
propelling
and
solidifying
prominent
media
myths
of
Watergate
five
of
which
are
discussed
here
bold
The
Washington
Post
brought
down
Nixon
s
corrupt
presidency
bold
This
long
ago
became
the
dominant
narrative
of
the
Watergate
scandal

It
holds
that
Woodward
and
Bernstein
through
their
dogged
reporting
revealed
the
crimes
that
forced
Nixon
to
resign
the
presidency
in
August


That
s
also
the
inescapable
if
tacit
conclusion
of
the
movie
which
places
Woodward
and
Bernstein
at
the
centre
of
Watergate
s
unravelling
while
minimising
or
ignoring
the
far
more
decisive
contributions
of
subpoena
wielding
investigators

Rolling
up
a
scandal
of
Watergate
s
dimension
and
complexity
required
the
collective
efforts
of
special
prosecutors
federal
judges
both
houses
of
Congress
the
Supreme
Court
as
well
as
the
Justice
Department
and
the
FBI

Even
then
Nixon
likely
would
have
survived
the
scandal
if
not
for
the
audiotape
recordings
he
secretly
made
of
conversations
in
the
Oval
Office
of
the
White
House

Only
when
compelled
by
the
Supreme
Court
did
Nixon
surrender
the
recordings
which
captured
him
approving
a
plan
to
divert
the
FBI
s
investigation
of
the
break
in

Interestingly
principals
at
the
Washington
Post
have
periodically
scoffed
at
the
dominant
narrative
of
Watergate

Woodward
for
example
once
said
the
mythologising
of
our
role
in
Watergate
has
gone
to
the
point
of
absurdity
where
journalists
write
that
I
single
handedly
brought
down
Richard
Nixon

Totally
absurd


bold
The
Post
at
least
uncovered
the
Watergate
story
bold
Not
quite

Watergate
began
as
a
police
beat
story

News
of
the
scandal
s
seminal
crime
the
thwarted
break
in
of
June
at
the
headquarters
of
the
Democratic
National
Committee
at
the
Watergate
complex
in
Washington
DC
began
circulating
within
hours

The
opening
paragraph
of
the
Post
s
front
page
report
about
the
burglary
made
clear
that
the
details
had
come
from
investigators

It
read
Five
men
one
of
whom
said
he
is
a
former
employee
of
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency
were
arrested
at
a
m

yesterday
in
what
authorities
described
as
an
elaborate
plot
to
bug
the
offices
of
the
Democratic
National
Committee
here

Nor
did
the
Post
uncover
crucial
elements
of
the
deepening
scandal
such
as
Nixon
s
secret
taping
system

Existence
of
the
White
House
tapes
was
disclosed
in
to
an
investigating
committee
of
the
US
Senate

And
as
Edward
Jay
Epstein
pointed
out
in
a
brilliant
essay
in
the
Watergate
reporting
of
Woodward
and
Bernstein
was
often
derivative
and
sustained
by
leaks
from
federal
investigations
into
the
scandal

bold
The
stealthy
Watergate
source
Deep
Throat
famously
advised
Woodward
to
follow
the
money
bold
That
pithy
and
often
quoted
line
supposedly
was
the
key
to
unlocking
the
complexities
of
Watergate

In
fact
it
was
born
of
dramatic
licence

W
Mark
Felt
speaks
to
reporters
in
Image
caption
In
W
Mark
Felt
a
justice
department
official
confessed
that
he
was
Deep
Throat
Follow
the
money
was
spoken
not
by
the
real
life
Deep
Throat
source
but
by
Hal
Holbrook
the
actor
who
played
Deep
Throat
in
All
the
President
s
Men

In
real
life
the
Deep
Throat
source
conferred
periodically
with
Woodward
sometimes
in
an
underground
car
park
as
the
scandal
unfolded

But
he
did
not
advise
Woodward
to
follow
the
money


Woodward
and
Bernstein
were
already
on
the
money
trail
One
of
their
most
important
stories
was
to
describe
how
funds
donated
to
Nixon
s
re
election
campaign
had
been
used
for
the
Watergate
break
in

But
unravelling
the
scandal
was
far
more
demanding
than
following
the
money

Nixon
resigned
not
because
he
misused
funds
donated
to
his
campaign
but
because
he
clearly
obstructed
justice

Deep
Throat
by
the
way
revealed
himself
in
to
have
been
W
Mark
Felt
formerly
the
FBI
s
second
ranking
official

He
was
no
hero
though

Felt
was
convicted
in
on
felony
charges
related
to
break
ins
he
had
approved
in
the
FBI
s
investigations
into
the
radical
Weather
Underground
organisation

But
Felt
never
went
to
jail

He
was
pardoned
in
by
President
Ronald
Reagan

bold
Their
Watergate
reporting
placed
Woodward
and
Bernstein
in
grave
danger
bold
Hardly
although
All
the
President
s
Men
says
as
much

In
a
scene
near
the
close
of
the
movie
Deep
Throat
tells
Woodward
that
the
reporters
lives
are
in
danger


The
warning
which
injected
drama
into
the
movie
s
sometimes
leaden
pacing
also
was
mentioned
in
All
the
President
s
Men
the
book

However
it
was
fairly
quickly
determined
to
have
been
a
false
alarm

Robert
Redford
I
came
in
when
journalism
had
reached
an
apex
of
morality
and
professionalism
Woodward
Bernstein
and
senior
editors
at
the
Post
took
precautions
for
a
while
to
avoid
the
suspected
electronic
surveillance
of
their
activities

But
as
Woodward
recounted
in
The
Secret
Man
his
book
about
Deep
Throat
such
measures
soon
seemed
melodramatic
and
unnecessary

We
never
found
any
evidence
that
our
phones
were
tapped
or
that
anyone
s
life
was
in
danger


On
another
occasion
Woodward
said
the
most
sinister
pressure
he
and
Bernstein
felt
during
Watergate
was
the
repeated
denial
by
Nixon
s
White
House
of
the
information
we
were
publishing
as
the
scandal
deepened

bold
University
enrolments
in
journalism
courses
soared
because
of
Watergate
bold
It
s
an
appealing
subsidiary
myth
that
the
Watergate
exploits
of
Woodward
and
Bernstein
as
dramatised
by
Redford
and
Hoffman
made
journalism
seem
glamorous
and
alluring

So
alluring
that
young
Americans
in
the
s
supposedly
thronged
to
enrol
on
journalism
courses

It
s
a
myth
that
endures
despite
its
thorough
repudiation
by
scholarly
research

One
such
study
financed
by
the
Freedom
Forum
media
foundation
reported
in
that
growth
in
journalism
education
resulted
not
from
such
specific
events
as
Watergate
but
rather
to
a
larger
extent
from
the
appeal
of
the
field
to
women
who
have
been
attending
universities
in
record
numbers


The
study
was
unequivocal
in
stating
that
students
didn
t
come
rushing
to
the
university
because
they
wanted
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
Woodward
and
Bernstein
or
Robert
Redford
and
Dustin
Hoffman
for
that
matter


A
similar
study
released
in
declared
It
is
frequently
and
wrongly
asserted
that
the
investigative
reporting
of
Woodward
and
Bernstein
provided
popular
role
models
for
students
and
led
to
a
boom
in
journalism
school
enrolments

Instead
that
study
found
that
enrolments
already
had
doubled
between
and
the
year
of
the
Watergate
break

About
HuntingMarch
We
decided
to
write
this
page
because
of
continual
confusion
about
this
forum
s
stand
on
hunting

This
is
not
a
pro
hunting
blog
nor
an
anti
hunting
blog

There
is
a
good
reason

Bad
feeling
between
hunters
and
those
don
t
like
hunting
is
probably
the
single
biggest
reason
why
there
is
not
a
widespread
political
movement
to
protect
and
enhance
wildlife
and
wildlife
habitat
in
the
United
States

Part
of
this
split
is
philosophical
but
part
is
deliberately
stirred
up
by
those
who
have
other
political
and
economic
agendas

We
would
rather
not
have
discussions
about
the
wrongness
or
rightfulness
of
hunting
but
they
seem
unavoidable

However
we
will
step
in
when
they
get
personal
or
otherwise
out
of
hand

Rural
legends

Ralph

It
was
suggested
in
another
thread
that
it
would
be
interesting
informative
and
useful
to
come
up
with
a
list
and
or
discuss
what
JB
has
called
rural
legends

These
would
be
similar
to
the
well
known
term
urban
legends
but
they
would
be
much
more
common
in
rural
areas
and
deal
with
the
outdoors
wildlife
hunting
and
fishing
farming
grazing
politics
related
to
these
things

So
let
s
see
if
we
can
discover
some

Already
a
number
or
people
have
described
the
belief
that
the
state
wildlife
department
or
the
federal
government
is
dropping
transplanting
turning
loose
various
kinds
of
undesirable
animals
in
rural
areas

I
first
heard
this
rumor
in
Idaho
in
the
early
s
when
there
was
the
persistent
rumor
that
Idaho
Fish
and
Game
was
turning
loose
bad
grizzly
bears
from
Yellowstone
Park
onto
Coolwater
Ridge
which
is
a
tall
and
broad
ridge
between
the
Selway
and
Lochsa
Rivers
in
north
central
Idaho
hundreds
of
miles
from
Yellowstone
Park

more
important
A
rural
legend
would
be
a
sub
class
of
urban
legends
according
the
the
Wikipedia
article
on
urban
legends

Despite
its
name
a
typical
urban
legend
does
not
necessarily
originate
in
an
urban
setting

The
term
is
simply
used
to
differentiate
modern
legend
from
traditional
folklore
in
preindustrial
times

For
this
reason
sociologists
and
folklorists
prefer
the
term
contemporary
legend

Urban
and
rural
legends
are
not
the
same
as
myths
but
they
are
related

Once
again
from
the
Wikipedia
The
earliest
term
by
which
these
narratives
were
known
urban
belief
tales
highlights
what
was
then
thought
to
be
a
key
property
they
were
held
by
their
tellers
to
be
true
accounts
and
the
device
of
the
FOAF
was
a
spurious
but
significant
effort
at
authentication

The
coinage
leads
in
turn
to
the
terms
FOAFlore
and
FOAFtale


While
at
least
one
classic
legend
the
Death
Car
has
been
shown
to
have
some
basis
in
fact
folklorists
as
such
are
interested
in
debunking
these
narratives
only
to
the
degree
that
establishing
non
factuality
warrants
the
assumption
that
there
must
be
some
other
reason
why
the
tales
are
told
and
believed

As
in
the
case
of
myth
these
narratives
are
believed
because
they
construct
and
reinforce
the
of
the
group
within
which
they
are
told
or
because
they
provide
us
with
coherent
and
convincing
explanations
of
complex
events
For
this
reason
it
is
characteristic
of
groups
within
which
a
given
narrative
circulates
to
react
very
negatively
to
claims
or
demonstrations
of
non
factuality
an
example
would
be
the
expressions
of
outrage
by
police
officers
who
are
told
that
adulteration
of
Halloween
treats
by
strangers
is
extremely
rare
if
it
has
occurred
at
all
or
the
vehement
responses

Where
to
begin
Let
s
see
Fish
Wildlife
brought
in
coyotes
to
kill
off
the
deer

Huh
When
coys
started
popping
up
in
KY
there
weren
t
that
many
deer
The
deer
population
has
just
exploded
in
the
last
or
so
years

The
reintroduced
elk
all
have
that
mad
cow
disease

Uh
no
or
at
least
to
the
best
of
the
state
veterinarian
s
knowledge
none
of
them
were
carrying
CWD

There
have
been
a
few
cases
of
some
type
of
a
brain
worm
but
no
CWD
thank
God
They
brought
in
bears
and
mountain
lions
to
kill
off
the
diseased
elk

See
previous
statement
hate
to
tell
em
but
there
were
lions
bears
in
the
mountains
of
Eastern
KY
loooong
before
the
elk
introduction
took
place
no
matter
what
the
powers
that
be
might
think
And
my
favorite
Fish
Wildlife
released
rattlesnakes
in
the
mountains
to
try
to
keep
out
hunters

Nope
they
ve
been
there
forever
too

But
I
ve
heard
that
a
lot
of
the
good
ol
boys
used
to
release
rattlesnakes
around
their
pot
fields
to
keep
people
from
looking
too
closely

That
one
s
most
likely
true

Oh
and
I
forgot
this
one
When
the
state
deer
population
was
hit
by
a
gnat
borne
hemorrhagic
syndrome
last
year
similar
to
blue
tongue
but
different
I
can
t
tell
you
how
many
people
I
tried
mostly
unsuccessfully
to
explain
to
that
it
wasn
t
mad
cow
disease
that
it
was
something
totally
different
The
usual
response
was
Well
that
s
what
they
want

to
think
Ahhh

Ralph
that
is
a
good
one



I
hope
it
was
true
The
legends
I
have
heard
from
around
here
are
the
same
ones
you
always
hear
everywhere
I
guess

Last
week
I
went
out
to
one
of
my
favorite
spots
in
Washington
and
ran
into
a
road
crew
that
was
fixing
the
road
I
wanted
to
go
down

It
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
the
work
had
stopped
but
the
security
guard
and
his
family
were
staying
the
night
there
to
watch
the
equipment

I
talked
with
him
about
a
slide
area
you
couldn
t
drive
around
which
they
had
fixed





and
then
he
mentioned
that
he
and
his
family
had
seen
a
huge
black
bear
about
lbs
and
that
there
were
a
couple
of
rigs
of
bear
hunters
chasing
him
right
then
and
that
the
big
bear
was
running
around
right
where
I
wanted
to
ride
my
bike

So
we
launched
into
a
talk
about
bears
and
he
told
me
after
he
realized
I
wasn
t
ascared
of
black
bears
that
now
grizzlies






that
s
another
thing
we
might
have
some
of
those
around
and
they
are
monsters




they
will
come
right
in
on
ya

I
wanted
to
get
on
to
what
I
came
to
do
so
I
cut
him
short
on
that
with
the
fact
that
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
them
in
Alaska
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
written
a
book
on
them

I
suspect
that
had
I
been
a
little
less
knowledgeable
about
bears
I
would
have
turned
around
and
gone
home



which
actually
I
did
after
I
tracked
the
bear
hunters
for
a
while
and
realized
that


the
bear
got
away
and


that
they
were
frustrated
and
on
the
ridge
above
me

I
am
way
more
ascared
of
a
rifle
than
a
bear

is

lbs
and
consumes
everything
in

A
couple
of

myths
wolves
have
never

or
attacked

are
decimating

populations
across

one

The
reintroduction
of
wolves
was
designed
to
drive
the
Western
livestock
industry
out
of
business



Salle
Avatar
Salle
August
And
The
wolves
were
also
reintroduced
to
kill
all
the
elk
so
that
they
could
close
down
hunting
and
ATVing
in
the
woods
in
order
to
drive
EVERYBODY
OUT
OF
THE
WOODS

And
then
you
know
the
moose
around
Yellowstone
are
decimated
by
the
wolves
AND
that
they
get
this
in
fifteen
years
time
have
evolved

Now
this
gets
interesting
because
there
are
TWO
evolution
stories
here
depending
on
which
they
you
re
going
for
here
a
the
moose
have
evolved
in
such
a
way
as
to
have
different
antlers
that
are
now
capable
of
scewering
two
wolves
in
one
swing
of
their
head
b
the
wolves
that
were
reintroduced
to
Yellowstone
in
were
NOT
the
first
reintroduction
attempt
this
last
century

They
were
actually
reintroduced
in
the
late
s
from
someplace
in
northern
Minnesota
and
let
out
somewhere
near
Gardiner
and
that
they
were
some
vicious
strain
of
powerwolf
but
the
ones
from
the
reintroduction
were
smaller
and
tamer
and
they
have
now
interbred
and
evolved
into
a
more
tolerable
strain
of
wolf

Though
they
have
still
over
populated
and
have
eaten
all
the
available
elk
to
date

Then
did
you
know
that
wolves
have
several
litters
of
pups
a
year
as
in
several
times
a
year
like
cats
can

They
never
told
me
about
these
things
in
genetics
class
And
I
didn
t
miss
a
lecture

Here
s
one
I
heard
at
the
gas
station
a
few
weeks
ago
The
government
wants
to
list
Polar
Bears
in
order
to
end
hunting

There
are
actually
lots
of
polar
bears
in
the
Arctic
but
the
government
changes
the
numbers
to
say
they
are
endangered
just
to
stop
all
bear
hunting
and
promote
the
environmentalist
global

Hal
and
JB
nailed
it

The
legend
of
the
introduced
insatiable
omnipotent
Canadian
Wolf
has
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
tales
ever
told

The
gist
being
that
somehow
the
feds
introduced
a
version
of
wolf
that
was
never
here
to
begin
with
and
outcompeted
the
version
of
the
wolf
that
was
already
here
in


This
alternate
strain
of
wolf
kills
everything
is
huge
and
wholly
fearless
of
humans

Oh
and
it
has
no
morals
unlke
its
smaller
kind
hearted
and
apparently
herbivorian
brother
that
was
here
originally

I
guess
my
question
is
this
do
people
really
think
wolves
recognize
or
have
ever
recognized
international
borders
If
you
believe
this
legend
then
you
believe
that
wolves
in
Idaho
did
not
historically
intermingle
with
wolves
in
Canada

Ever

But
alas
logic
does
not
rule
the
day
and
I
am
merely
laughed
at
by
the
fiends
in
their
Spire
of

And
I

for

I

wolves
are
probably
to

I

that
s
not

a

Changing
the
subject
from

there
is
legend
that
the

of

neatly

Yes
that
would
be
a
myth
but
to
say
that
wolves
primarily
kill
the
old
the
sick
and
the
crippled
would
be
accurate

I
think
that
is
what

correct

no

I
get
on

from

The
one

it
from

from

you
mean
to

there
is
legend
that
the

of
the

Myths
I
ve
heard
Entire
herds
and
flocks
being
obliterated
in
one
night

The
wolf
s
utter
incapacity
to
control
their
own
number
without
human
management

Wolves
and
coyotes
interbreeding
super
hyper
killer
mutant
wolf
gumbercules
An
insatiable
longing
to
stalk
and
kill
children
not
to
mention
any
other
small
human
owned
critter
no
offence
intended
parents


The
act
of
making
carcass
wards
to
scare
other
wolves
off
a
ranch
unfortunately
only
humans
react
to
such
things


Personally
I
think
its
just
showing
off
could
be
mistaken

Wolves
when
hunting
Tearing
foetuses
out
of
a
living
mother
ungulate
Eating
their
prey
alive
sometimes
but
not
a
frequent
occurrence
Being
cruel
when
killing
and
thoroughly
enjoying
the
act
Then
again
we
ve
also
got
the
guys
who
accept
the
wolf
as
a
predator
aka
something
that
needs
to
be
shot
on
sight
because
it
spoils
happy
time

wait
we
forgot
the
one
where
wolves
were
reintroduced
by
vegatarians
so
thatthey
could
kill
the
cows
off
and
woves
were
an
environmentalist
scheme
to
kill
all
the
cattle
on
public
lands


the
pine
beetle
problem
is
a
result
of
the
government
trying
to
use
them
to
control
weeds
wolves
would
have
died
out
in
the
Rockies
even
if
they
hadn
t
been
hunted
to
extinction
there


wolves
kill
every
animal
they
come
across
and
leave
them
there
to
rot


all
hunters
want
to
keep
elk
feeding
grounds
so
they
can
shoot
bigger
bulls
and
get
more
cow
tags
every
rancher
is
a

hater

I
really
don
t
know
why
you
think
that
the
only
useful
animal
to
a
hunter
is
one
that
he
can
kill

Most
true
sportsmen
enjoy
all
the
critters
and
yes
even
the
wolves
at
times

As
far
as
bigfoot
tags
go
I
really
don
t
feel
there
numbers
are
great
enough
yet
for
a
season
and
personally
I
hope
no
matter
how
many
there
are
they
won
t
open
a
season

I
would
however
like
to
train
one
to
pack
out
my
elk

I
actually
own
an
atv
but
I
don
t
hunt
from
it
and
with
me
getting
older
I
can
t
pack
as
well
as
I
used
to

I
ve
been
told
though
that
the
bigfoot
is
really
fond
of
jerky
and
with
the
right
jerky
you
can
get
them
to
do
almost
anything

I
ve
never
tried
b
bq
rats
or
bigfoot
but
with
enough
catsup
you
can
make
anything
taste
better
probably
even
a
wolf

Little
bit
out
of
this
topic
here
nevertheless
I
have
no
problem
at
all
with
hunting
in
general
hunting
for
food
delicious
to
be
precise

This
however
does
not
include
what
in
Africa
is
called
hunting
bushmeat
animals
that
are
not
really
edible


I
have
however
a
problem
with
huting
in
so
far
as
over
the
centuries
countless
species
have
been
driven
into
extinction
or
to
near
extinction
by
over
hunting

I
have
a
severe
problem
with
ego
hunting

With
the
sportsmen
a
term
left
over
from
the
glory
days
of
hunting
in
the
commonwealth
I
think
putting
the
lights
out
of
a
bear
a
tiger
a
lion
a
buffalo
a
coyote
an
elk
a
wolf
or
whatever
it
is
just
for
the
fun
of
it
just
because
one
is
able
to
do
so
Just
to
show
with
a
pelt
hanging
near
the
fireplace
what
a
tough
guy
one
is

Just
to
prove
with
a
picture
where
one
is
posing
with
a
sheepish
grin
behind
a
bear
carcass
or
even
worse
with
one
foot
on
this
carcass

I
honestly
dislike
the
hypocritical
is
this
the
appropriate
word
attitude
of
our
german
hunting
organisations
We
accept
the
presence
of
those
wolves
only
if
we
are
allowed
to
manage
them

Pennsylvania

around
at

in

but
that
doesn
t
stop
some
folks
from
reporting
having
seen
a
wolf
or
wolves
in
the
state
or
Northeast

Here
s
a
comment
one
of
my

s
recent

elicited
from
a

Cougars

mill
participants
wouldn
t
one
have
been
road
killed
by
now
given
the
presence
of
so
many
roads
on

I
saw
a
black
wolf
in
SW
Pennsylvania
years
ago

At
first
it
looked
like
a
small
medium
bear
due
to
distance


I
ran
to
my
truck
to
grab
my
spotting
scope
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
is
was
a
wolf

I
am
a
Biologist
and
so
is
one
other
person
that
was
in

group

There
is
no
chance
that
this
animal
was
a
coyote

I
have
lived
in
close
proximity
to
several
packs
over
the
years
and
I
know
this
animal
was
no
coyote

I
m
also
willing
to
wager
that
it
was
no
wild
dog

Unfortunately
it
was
too
far
away
to
get
decent
photos
but
with
the
spotting
scope
we
got
very
good
looks

my

comments
I
remember
hearing
a
story
from
an

about
how
he
was
confronted
by
someone
in
Riggins
Idaho
about
how
the
IDFG
was
stocking
grizzly
bears
wolves
and
rattlesnakes
in
the
area

I
ve
also
heard
the
stories
about
Yellowstone
rangers
being
asked
questions
like
Why
do
they
put
the
blue
stuff
in
the
lake
Why
are
the
those
little
red
dogs
hanging
out
with
the
buffalo
When
do
the
deer
turn
into
elk
moose
As
a
fisheries
person
I
overheard
someone
explaining
that
the
trout
hanging
out
with
the
salmon
were
bull
trout
that
were
going
to
dig
up
the
eggs
so
they
could
eat
them

They
were
actually
jack
Chinook
salmon
or
males
that
only
spend
one
year
in
the
ocean
as
compared
to
or
three

FYI
they
die
just

of
them

The
first
outlined
stage
is
a
scarcity
of
wild
game
be
it
due
to
habitat
loss
seasonal
migration
or
often
times
over
predation

Wolves
begin
approaching
human
habitations
though
limiting
their
visits
to
nocturnal
hours

Their
presence
is
usually
established
by
barking
matches
with
local
dogs

After
a
certain
amount
of
time
wolves
begin
to
frequent
human
habitations
in
daylight
hours
and
observe
people
and
livestock
at
a
distance

The
wolves
begin
acting
bolder
by
attacking
small
stock
and
pets
at
daylight
sometimes
pursuing
their
prey
up
to
verandas

The
wolves
at
this
point
do
not
focus
on
humans
but
will
growl
and
act
threateningly
toward
them

The
wolves
begin
attacking
large
bodied
livestock
and
may
follow
riders

People
begin
to
be
harassed
usually
in
a
playful
manner

The
wolves
will
chase
people
over
short
distances
and
nip
at
them
though
will
retreat
if
confronted

Wolves
begin
to
attack
people
in
predatory
fashions

will

for
food
as
well
as
self
defense

that
other

only
attack

Then

will

for

Let
s
not
forget
the
wily
critter
of
the
plains
and
sagebrush

The
trophy
Jack
a
lope

A
friend
of
mine
had
a
sporting
goods
store
in
western
colorado
when
I
lived
there

I
would
help
him
out
at
times
with
bore
sighting
rifles
for
the
out
of
state
hunters
that
would
come
into
the
store
to
buy
their
elk
and
deer
tags

He
had
a
Jack
a
lope
mount
on
the
wall
and
you
wouldn
t
believe
how
many
people
would
belive
that
he
had
actually
taken
it
not
miles
from
the
store
some
even
asked
if
they
had
tags
available

Those
are
the
years
I
wore
extra
orange
during
the
season
and
probably
a
big
reason
I
started
archery
hunting
more
than

Actually
black
bears
have
attacked
more
people
than
any
of
the
others
but
there
are
more
black
bears
living
where
there
are
more
people
so
there
are
more
encounters

Personally
I
don
t
trust
any
of
them
and
respect
all
the
predators
actually
all
wild
animals

The
only
bear
I
ve
ever
had
to
dispose
of
had
been
wounded
a
week
prior
to
our
meeting
by
some
other
hunters
that
made
a
bad
shot
he
fell
seven
feet
from
my
rifle
barrel
and
scared
the
hell
out
of
me
at
full
charge
this
however
is
not
normal
and
he
was
a
black

I
ve
had
black
bears
close
several
times
and
they
will
dance
on
there
forepaws
back
and
forth
woofing
and
huffing
sometimes
popping
their
teeth
so
loud
you
would
think
they
would
break
but
every
time
I
ve
seen
this
I
back
out
slowly
and
other
than
maybe
having
to
clean
out
my
drawers
haven
t
had
problem

I
ve
read
many
books
on
documented
bear
attacks
and
all
species
will
attack
under
the
right
circumstances

The
main
thing
to
do
when
in
the
woods
I
think
is
mainly
be
aware
of
your
surroundings
pay
attention
to
the
tracks
and
scat
certain
areas
during
certain
times
of
the
year
are
used
more
often
than
others
by
bears

Personally
in
North
Idaho
we
have
more
encounters
with
moose
than
bears

Their
big
and
can
get
kind
of
crazy
during
the
rut
and

those

vicki
I
was
just
wondering
where
they
were
taken
but
there
was
nothing
there
except
rocky
mountains


So
do
black
bears
attack
people
and
deer
etc

for
food
regularly
I
was
under
the
impression
that
like
wolves
they
normally
kept
to
smaller
stuff
and
fish
and
being
omnivorous
also
relied
on
vegetation
so
that
they
normally
left
people
alone

I
know
about
the
tying
up
your
grub
when
you
re
out
there
so
the
bears
won
t
get
it
but
there
s
never
really
any
warning
about
the
bears
getting
You
unless
you
come
between
them

liked
this
on
Ranger
tells
everyone
to
wear
bells
around
their
neck
and
carry
pepper
spray
to
ward
off
bear
attack

The
bells
alert
the
bears
to
your
presence
and
the
spray
is
a
last
ditch
ten
feet
hail
Mary
when
all
else
fails

He
tells
the
hikers
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
bears
in
the
area
Grizzlies
and
Black
bears

He
then
tells
them
that
they
need
to
recognize
the
bear
s
scat
so
they
can
tell
the
two
species
apart

He
sez
that
black
bears
are
much
less
likely
to
attack
so

see
black
bear
scat

may
continue

But
if
they
encounter
grizzly
scat
they
should
give
the

berth

A
tourist
asks
how
to
tell
the
difference

The
ranger
replies
Easy
black
bears
are
grazers
more
than
fish
eaters

The
black
bear
scat
is
usually
full
of
blackberry
seeds
hackberrys
and
acorns
and
other
plant
life
and
it
smells
like
almonds

Grizzly

is
larger
and
it
is
full
of
bells
and
smells
like
pepper
spray

What
makes
a
scary
movie
extra
creepy
We
would
argue
it
s
the
specter
of
truth
that
something
bad
or
spooky
can
happen
because
we
heard
it
happened
for
real
somewhere

Enter
urban
legends

Stories
are
passed
down
through
generations
they
always
have
been

And
sometimes
unexplained
rumors
of
something
that
happened
to
someone
somewhere
can
gain
powerful
momentum
if
enough
folks
keep
those
stories
alive
with
new
details
and
new
audiences

Urban
legends
play
on
our
biggest
fears
of
the
unknown
that
something
sinister
could
be
lurking
in
a
place
or
situation
we
otherwise
feel
safe
in

But
they
re
also
fantastic
jumping
off
points
for
movies
and
more
stories

We
pulled
together
a
list
of
some
of
the
creepiest
movies
based
on
or
surrounding
urban
legends
just
in
time
for
your
Halloween
watch
party

The
Ring
BUTTON
urban
legends
the
ring
rmrk
st
Remarkist
Magazine
The
movie
The
Ring
inspired
by
the
Japanese
horror
film
Ringu
itself
inspired
by
the
novel
Ring
by
Koji
Suzuki
relies
on
the
urban
legend
of
a
cursed
videotape
that
when
watched
leads
to
the
viewer
s
death
seven
days
later
unless
they
can
solve
the
mystery
surrounding
it

This
concept
of
a
cursed
video
or
image
leading
to
doom
is
linked
to
several
urban
legends
but
one
of
the
most
prominent
is
the
Japanese
kuchisake
onna
Slit
Mouthed
Woman
legend
where
a
vengeful
female
spirit
appears
with
a
disfigured
face
and
asks
potential
victims
if
they
find
her
beautiful

Depending
on
their
answer
she
either
kills
them
or
harms
them

The
Ring
urban
legend
plays
on
the
broader
concept
of
a
jinx
or
cursed
media
where
engaging
with
specific
content
like
a
tape
or
photo
has
a
supernatural
consequence

The
idea
of
cursed
objects
or
communication
causing
death
has
a
long
history
in
folklore
worldwide
ranging
from
cursed
paintings
to
cursed
phone
numbers

The
cursed
videotape
in
The
Ring
serves
as
a
modern
adaptation
of
these
older
legends



Candyman
BUTTON
urban

candyman
rmrk

Remarkist

Have
you
ever
been
at
a
sleepover
and
gathered
with
friends
in
the
bathroom
to
chant
Bloody
Mary
while
staring
into
the
mirror
Just
us
Well
the
horror
film
Candyman
is
based
on
author
Clive
Barker
s
short
story
The
Forbidden
but
it
is
heavily
influenced
by
urban
legends
particularly
Bloody
Mary

In
this
story
however
the
ghost
of
a
hook
handed
man
appears
when
someone
says
his
name
five
times
in
front
of
a
mirror

It
s
giving
Beetlejuice

This
directly
ahem
mirrors
the
Bloody
Mary
game
in
which
a
spirit
is
said
to
appear
when
her
name
is
chanted
multiple
times
while
looking
in
a
mirror

Both
legends
involve
summoning
a
deadly
supernatural
entity
through
a
ritual
usually
a
dare

Candyman
also
has
another
important
element
that
often
goes
hand
in
hand
with
urban
legends
the
theme
of
racial
violence
and
injustice

The
backstory
of
the
Candyman
character
is
that
he
was
a
Black
artist
named
Daniel
Robitaille
who
was
brutally
lynched
in
the
late
th
century
for
having
a
romantic
relationship
with
a
white
woman

He
was
tortured
by
having
his
hand
cut
off
and
replaced
with
a
hook
and
this
racially
charged
backstory
makes
Candyman
a
complex
blend
of
horror
and
commentary
on
the
historical
mistreatment
of
Black
people

The
setting
of
the
film
further
digs
into
the
often
unfair
and
racially
charged
fears
and
anxieties
of
urban
life
including
poverty
and
crime

Based
on
Lois
Duncan
s
novel
of
the
same
name
the
slasher
film
I
Know
What
You
Did
Last
Summer
is
inspired
by
a
famous
urban
legend

Often
referred
to
as
The
Hook
or
The
Hookman
the
legend
features
a
hook
handed
killer
who
stalks
and
attacks
young
couples
often
parked
in
a
secluded
lover
s
lane
area

A
couple
hears
a
news
report
on
the
radio
about
an
escaped
mental
patient
or
killer
with
a
hook
for
a
hand

They
become
frightened
and
decide
to
leave
the
area
only
to
later
discover
a
hook
hanging
from
the
car
door
suggesting
the
killer
was
recently
nearby

The
story
plays
on
fears
of
vulnerable
teens
being
attacked
in
isolated
locations

In
I
Know
What
You
Did
Last
Summer
a
group
of
teenagers
accidentally
hit
a
man
with
their
car
and
thinking
he

dispose

body

A
year

they
begin
receiving
threatening
messages
from
someone
who
says
they
know
what
they
did
and
soon
begin
being
stalked
by
a
killer

expands

original
urban
legend

the
origin
is
still
there



Slender
Man

rmrk
st
Remarkist

Born
from
a
modern
urban
legend
that
originated
in
the
digital
space
as
opposed
to
urban
legends
that
are
passed
down
through
stories
over
decades
the
Slender
Man
was
created
in
by
Eric
Knudsen
alias
Victor
Surge
on
the
online
forum
Something
Awful

It
quickly
took
on
a
life
of
its
own
and
became
an
internet
myth
gaining
widespread
influence
as
other
users
contributed
additional
stories
artwork
and
videos
to
the
character
s
lore

Slender
Man
is
typically
depicted
as
a
tall
thin
figure
with
a
featureless
white
face
and
tentacle
like
appendages

He
is
often
shown
wearing
a
black
suit
and
he
stalks
abducts
or
influences
children
and
teens
leading
them
into
forests
or
causing
them
to
act
irrationally

The
character
s
lack
of
distinct
features
makes
him
especially
unsettling
and
he
has
become
associated
with
psychological
horror
and
the
idea
of
losing
control
to
a
mysterious
force

The
movie
Slender
Man
is
about
a
group
of
teenage
girls
who
summon
the
Slender
Man
through
an
online
ritual
and
then
find
themselves
haunted
by
him

The
film
taps
into
fears
around
the
dangers
of
the
internet
how
myths
and
memes
can
spiral
into
something
terrifying
and
how
they
can
influence
vulnerable
minds

In
a
tragic
real
life
twist
this
urban
legend
was
also
tied
to
a
real
life
incident
in
when
two
year
old
girls
in
Wisconsin
stabbed
a
classmate
in
an
attempt
to
appease
Slender
Man
believing
that
they
would
become
his
proxies

While
the
film
does
not
directly
address
the
crime
the
real
world
implications
of
the
Slender
Man
legend
added
an
additional
layer
of
creepiness
to
the
character

rmrk
st
Remarkist
Magazine
The
film
based
on
John
Keel
s
book
of
the
same
name
The
Mothman
Prophecies
was
inspired
by
real
life
events
and
an
urban
legend
surrounding
the
mysterious
creature
known
as
the
Mothman

The
legend
originates
from
sightings
in
the
small
town
of
Point
Pleasant
West
Virginia
during
the
mid
s

Keel
s
book
explores
his
investigations
into
the
sightings
and
their
possible
connection
to
supernatural
phenomena
and
tragic
events

In
gravediggers
in
Clendenin
West
Virginia
claimed
to
have
seen
a
large
humanoid
figure
with
wings
flying
overhead
and
two
young
couples
reported
seeing
a
man
sized
creature
with
large
wings
and
glowing
red
eyes
who
could
fly
at
incredibly
high
speeds
and
follow
their
car
as
they
fled
the
area

Over
the
next
year
many
residents
of
Point
Pleasant
reported
sightings
of
the
Mothman
and
in
some
cases
witnesses
experienced
feelings
of
dread
anxiety
or
paranormal
events
after
encountering
the
creature

In
the
Silver
Bridge
which
connected
Point
Pleasant
to
Ohio
over
the
Ohio
River
suddenly
collapsed
killing
people

The
collapse
was
attributed
to
a
structural
failure
but
many
locals
believed
that
the
Mothman
sightings
were
an
omen
predicting
the
disaster
and
after
it
happened
there
were
less
reports
of
Mothman
sightings

In
the
movie
a
journalist
played
by
Richard
Gere
investigates
the
strange
sightings
and
prophetic
warnings
in
a
small
town

Using
the
real
life
reports
and
the
Silver
Bridge
disaster
as
a
backdrop
the
film
amplifies
the
eerie
idea
that
the
Mothman
may
be
a
supernatural
being
or
entity
that
foreshadows
catastrophe
weaving
elements
of
mystery
paranoia
and
the
unexplained
into
the
narrative



Blair

Project
BUTTON

project
urban

rmrk
st
Remarkist
Magazine
This
movie
wasn
t
based
on
an
urban
legend
per
se
but
it
used
the
idea
of
urban
legends
and
folklore
to
scare
viewers

Also
The
filmmakers
created
and
disseminated
a
fictional
urban
legend
of
their
own
to
promote
the
film
of
course

Early
internet
culture
helped
to
make
their
fictional
legend
seem
real
the
filmmakers
created
a
website
that
presented
the
Blair
Witch
story
as
genuine
folklore
complete
with
fake
newspaper
articles
journal
entries
and
missing
person
reports
about
the
disappearance
of
the
film
s
protagonists

This
viral
marketing
campaign
which
blurred
the
line
between
reality
and
fiction
how
quaint
to
imagine
this
in
modern
day
smartly
mimicked
the
way
urban
legends
spread
in
the
modern
age
using
the
internet
as
a
new
medium
for
word
of
mouth

The
legend
in
the
movie
was
designed
to
feel
like
an
authentic
ancient
myth
and
the
film
cleverly
presents
it
as
if
it
were
real
using
a
found
footage
style
to
add
to
the
illusion
of
authenticity

In
it
three
student
filmmakers
Heather
Josh
and
Mike
venture
into
the
woods
near
Burkittsville
Maryland
in
to
make
a
documentary
about
the
Blair
Witch
legend

According
to
this
fictional
lore
which
we
see
play
out
in
The
Blair
Witch
Project
the
Blair
Witch
is
a
vengeful
spirit
tied
to
the
town
of
Burkittsville
formerly
called
Blair


The
legend
spans
centuries
beginning
with
the
story
of
Elly
Kedward
a
woman
accused
of
witchcraft
in
and
banished
to
the
woods
after
children
accused
her
of
luring
them
to
her
house
to
draw
blood

Kedward
was
presumed
to
have
died
in
the
wilderness
but
soon
after
her
disappearance
the
townspeople
began
to
vanish
and
the
remaining
villagers
abandoned
Blair
convinced
that
the
area
was
cursed

The
legend
suggests
that
Kedward
s
spirit
known
as
the
Blair
Witch
haunted
the
woods
around
Burkittsville
causing
mysterious
disappearances
and
deaths
over
the
years

The
legend
goes
further
citing
the
abduction
of
a
group
of
children
in
the
s
by
a
man
named
Rustin
Parr
who
killed
them
in
his
cabin
claiming
that
the
Blair
Witch
made
him
do
it

All
of
this
lore
adds
to
the
realness
of
this
fake
documentary
style
movie
and
it
even
fooled
some
audiences
into
believing
that
the
legend
really
existed

Legend
BUTTON

st

Finally
the
horror
film
Urban
Legend
illustrates
exactly
why
urban
legends
are
excellent
fodder
for
a
scary
movie

Set
on
a
college
campus
a
series
of
gruesome
student
murders
start
happening
and
they
seem
to
reflect
commonly
known
urban
legends

Indeed
the
killer
in
the
film
uses
these
legends
as
inspiration
for
creative
killings
and
the
plot
heavily
relies
on
the
audience
recognizing
these
myths

Among
the
common
urban
legends
depicted
are
the
lover
s
lane
hookman
very
I
Know
What
You
Did
Last
Summer
a
killer
hiding
in
the
backseat
waiting
to
strike
the
call
coming
from
inside
the
house
the
Bloody
Mary
myth
pop
rocks
and
soda
combo
death
flashing
headlight
gang
initiations
kidney
heist
organ
theft
and
more

The
film
helps
perpetuate
these
urban
legend
fears
and
that
of
course
makes
it
easier
to
build
a
franchise
of
sequels
But
one
thing
is
made
clear
urban
legends
will
always
be
passed
from
generation
to
generation
and
like
story
tropes
serve
as
endless
inspiration

s
Day
than
the
average
person
as
I
wrote
two
years
ago

This
time
we
re
going
to
look
at
some
of
the
myths
related
to
the
man
St

Patrick

Shamrocks
Legend
has
it
that
British
born
St

Patrick
used
a
shamrock
to
teach
Irish
pagans
about
the
trinity

However
there
s
a
few
problems
with
this
The
word
shamrock
doesn
t
come
into
use
until
a
thousand
years
after
St

Patrick
s
death
and
it
took
nearly
as
long
for
this
legend
to
develop

There
s
disagreement
on
if
there
actually
is
such
a
thing
as
a
shamrock
and
if
it
they
exist
if
they
re
capable
of
growing
in
non
Irish
soil

Most
significantly
St

Patrick
never
alludes
to
anything
like
this
in
his
only
two
extant
writings
the
Confessio
and
the
Epistola

Aside
from
these
two
documents
we
really
don
t
know
anything
else
about
Ireland
s
British
Bishop

Snakes
Ever
heard
about
St

Patrick
chasing
all
the
snakes
out
of
Ireland
Uh
uh

Nope

Didn
t
happen
since
the
island
never
had
snakes

And
again
he
never
wrote
anything
about
chasing
killing
or
even
screaming
and
running
away
from
snakes

Nobody
mentions
this
legend
until
years
after
the
approximate
date
of
his
death

And
about
that
date

March
is
said
to
be
St

Patrick
s
date
of
death
not
birth

Nobody
recorded
the
date
it
just
showed
up
on
liturgical
calendar
centuries
later

Slavery
Patrick
s
father
had
a
successful
business
enriched
by
slave
labor

Ironically
Patrick
was
kidnapped
from
Britain
and
sold
into
slavery
in
Ireland
at
age


After
six
years
a
slave
Patrick
escaped
back
to
Britain

He
trained
for
the
ministry
and
dreamed
that
God
was
calling
him
to
go
back
to
preach
in
Ireland

He
was
enslaved
again
for
a
short
period
of
time
but
Patrick
refused
to
be
deterred
from
his
purpose
describing
himself
as
being
bound
by
the
Spirit
to
minister
in
the
land
of
his
captivity

Souls
over
Gold
As
soon
as
Valentine
s
Day
ends
naked
cupids
are
displaced
by
leprechauns
clothed
thankfully
on
retail
shelves

Is
this
a
case
of
Roman
icons
being
gentrified
by
Irish
ones
Anyway
the
clever
little
creatures
with
pots
of
gold
at
the
end
of
rainbows
have
nothing
to
do
with
St

Patrick

This
saint
developed
a
love
for
souls
over
gold
and
argued
for
people
to
be
prized
over
possessions

St

Patrick
wrote
his
fiery
Epistola
as
a
call
for
repentance
and
reparations
from
those
who
had
killed
enslaved
and
sold
women
and
men
he
had
just
baptized
and
anointed

In
doing
so
he
was
putting
his
life
on
the
line
for
a
wholistic
ministry

He
wasn
t
satisfied
with
people
s
soul
s
being
saved
while
their
bodies
were
in
bondage
It
is
not
that
I
would
choose
to
let
anything
so
blunt
and
harsh
come
from
my
mouth
but
I
am
driven
by
the
zeal
for
God

And
the
truth
of
Christ
stimulates
me
for
love
of
neighbors
and
children
for
these
I
have
given
up
my
homeland
and
my
parents
and
my
very
life
to
death
The
Most
High
does
not
accept
the
gifts
of
evildoers

The
one
who
offers
a
sacrifice
taken
from
what
belongs
to
the
poor
is
like
one
who
sacrifices
a
child
in
the
very
sight
of
the
child
s
father

Riches
says
Scripture
which
a
person
gathers
unjustly
will
be
vomited
out
of
that
person
s
stomach

The
angel
of
death
will
drag
such
a
one
away
to
be
crushed
by
the
anger
of
dragons

St

Patrick
continued
by
urging
his
followers
to
resist
flattering
these
traffickers
and
to
boycott
them
instead
A
ll
the
holy
and
humble
of
heart
should
not
fawn
on
such
people
nor
even
share
food
or
drink
with
them
nor
accept
their
alms
until
such
time
as
they
make
satisfaction
to
God
in
severe
penance
and
shedding
of
tears
and
until
they
set
free
the
men
servants
of
God
and
the
baptised
women
servants
of
Christ
for
whom
he
died
and
was
crucified

Shouldn
t
commemorations
of
St

Patrick
s
legacy
set
higher
goals
than
wearing
green
clothes
eating
green
cookies
and
cupcakes
and
turning
rivers
green
for
a
day
Why
not
draft
modern
versions
of
the
Epistola
instead
of
getting
drunk
on
green
beer

Going
Back
Have
you
ever
wanted
to
order
or
purchase
some
product
or
service
only
to
discover
that
the
price
advertised
or
shown
was
not
really
the
true
bottom
line
and
that
there
were
additional
fees
attached
Yes
if
you
are
like
me
I
am
tired
of
paying
additional
fees
for
something
I
consider
basic
and
should
be
included
with
the
service

In
today
s
Money
Monday
we
explore
some
ideas
on
how
to
avoid
or
beat
the
extra
fees
game

Credit
or
Debit
While
less
people
walk
around
today
with
cash
in
their
wallets
or
purses
the
truth
is
that
cash
still
remains
king
There
are
some
services
or
businesses
on
which
surcharges
are
imposed

A
surcharge
is
nothing
more
than
an
extra
fee
or
tax
imposed
on
an
item
beyond
the
regular
price

For
example
gas
stations
or
resturants
impose
a
surcharge
or
extra
fee
on
purchases
made
by
credit
card

The
extra
fee
may
range
from


to


of
the
product
or
service
cost
just
because
you
paid
for
it
by
using
your
credit
card

So
the
next
time
you
want
to
fill
up
your
gas
tank
you
may
want
to
consider
using
a
debit
card
or
cash

The
key
point
here
is
that
by
law
a
business
is
prohibited
from
charging
you
an
extra
fee
when
you
pay
by
debit
card

Travel
Fees
We
have
all
fallen
victim
or
have
been
tempted
to
pay
some
additional
fee
to
purchase
a
seat
from
the
airline
when
traveling

I
hate
to
pay
an
extra


or


for
a
seat
when
purchasing
a
ticket

The
may
way
to
avoid
paying
for
your
seat
is
to
opt
out
of
purchasing
a
ticket
which
is
a
choice
I
make
regularly

Now
I
will
admit
that
this
strategy
comes
with
the
risk
of
you
being
assigned
a
middle
seat
on
the
flight

How
do
I
reduce
the
middle
seat
assignment
You
arrive
at
the
airport
early

That
way
you
can
negotiate
for
a
change
of
seating
since
lots
of
people
arrive
later
to
check
in
which
provides
you
with
a
greater
opportunity
of
obtaining
a
window
or
aisle
seat
thereby
avoiding
the
extra
seating
fee

Finally
if
it
s
a
short
flight
I
m
more
likely
to
opt
out
of
paying
the
extra
seats
fee
and
take
the
risk
of
being
assigned
a
middle
row
seat

Car
Rental
Insurance
I
am
sure
most
people
are
aware
that
if
you
rent
a
vehicle
you
can
use
your
personal
private
vehicle
insurance
to
insure
your
rental

Applying
your
personal
vehicle
insurance
to
your
rental
allows
you
to
avoid
purchasing
insurance
from
the
rental
company

While
that
may
be
common
knowledge
there
are
a
few
things
of
which
you
need
to
be
aware

First
your
private
vehicle
auto
insurance
policy
should
cover
both
collision
and
comprehensive
or
else
your
rental
will
be
underinsured
in
the
event
of
an
accident

Secondly
when
obtaining
a
car
rental
you
may
want
to
consider
using
a
credit
card
which
offers
car
rental
insurance
especially
if
you
are
leaving
the
country

What
is
important
to
note
is
that
while
you
may
use
a
credit
card
which
provides
car
rental
insurance
most
of
these
credit
cards
exclude
places
such
as
Italy
Australia
Israel
and
Jamaica
from
their
coverage

Chase
bank
credit
cards
offer
the
best
car
rental
benefits
when
considering
which
credit
card
to
use
for
vehicle
rentals

Entertainment
According
to
the
Government
Accountability
Office
the
average
fee
for
purchasing
a
concert
or
sports
ticket
is
of
the
ticket
cost

As
a
Los
Angeles
Lakers
fan
I
refuse
to
pay
those
fees
for
a
game
ticket

The
best
way
to
avoid
or
reduce
paying
fees
while
not
convenient
is
to
purchase
your
ticket
at
the
venue
s
box
office
instead

If
your
team
does
not
win
the
game
at
least
you
would
have
saved
some
money
in
the
process

WHAT
S
UP
Today
s
What
s
Up
is
about
how
much
money
you
should
keep
in
your
checking
account

Interest
rates
on
checking
accounts
are
paying
about


so
keeping
lots
of
money
in
your
checking
account
does
not
make
sense
today

The
recommendation
from
some
banking
officials
is
that
you
retain
one
month
s
operating
or
monthly
living
expenses
in
your
checking
account


At
most
they
suggest
you
retain
two
months
of
your
living
expenses
in
your
operating
or
checking
account

If
it
s
not
earning
or
working
for
you
why
keep
it
in
your
checking
account
And
that
s
what
s
up

When
It
s
Supposed
to
Be
The
Most
Wonderful
Time
of
the
Year
But
It
s
Not
A
Holiday
Gift
That
Makes
A
Difference
Ruthven
R
Phillip
Esq
We
have
entered
what
some
would
call
the
most
wonderful
time
of
the
year
with
holiday
shopping
food
football
friends
and
family

It
s
a
time
when
we
make
list
and
decide
on
who
will
get
what
gift
and
how
much
they
will
cost

But
this
holiday
season
i
am
suggesting
you
do
something
different
and
give
a
gift
that
can
change
a
young
person
s
life
or
have
lifelong
impact

What
I
am
referring
to
you
may
ask
I
am
referring
to
instead
of
making
that
traditional
gift
of
clothes
and
toys
how
about
making
a
gift
to
that
young
person
s
plan
for
educational
purposes

Sure
It
is
not
sexy
at
the
moment
but
it
can
provide
an
education
which
will
have
lasting
impact

What
are
Plans
A
plan
is
also
known
as
a
Qualified
Tuition
Program
which
came
into
existence
in


Each
program
is
administered
by
a
state
or
state
agency
and
allows
contributions
from
parents
friends
or
family
members
on
behalf
of
a
beneficiary
usually
a
child
or
children
into
this
fund

plans
are
widely
known
as
accounts
in
which
funds
are
deposited
saved
and
used
to
pay
for
future
educational
expenses

While
that
is
true
these
plans
can
also
be
used
tp
prepay
college
tuition
at
a
qualified
higher
education
institution

How
Does
It
Work
As
mentioned
there
are
two
ways
to
engage
in
a
plan

The
first
is
through
prepayment
of
a
child
s
educational
expenses
at
an
educational
institution

Contributing
through
this
option
allows
for
the
prepayment
of
all
or
a
portion
of
the
child
s
future
college
tuition
at
today
s
rates
which
can
protect
against
future
increases

The
idea
is
to
lock
in
your
contributions
and
thereby
your
investing
to
an
account
which
will
mirror
increases
in
tuition
rates
should
they
escalate

When
you
think
about
it
this
option
seems
likely
to
make
the
most
sense
but
there
are
some
significant
restrictions
associated

Using
the
prepaid
plans
means
that
they
can
only
be
applied
to
in
state
colleges

With
a
traditional
or
non
prepayment
plan
you
are
allowed
to
choose
the
investment
portfolio

However
with
a
prepayment
plan
you
are
not
allowed
to
choose
your
investments
since
the
plan
manager
is
focused
on
ensuring
that
your
investment
keeps
pace
with
raising
tuition
cost

Another
drawback
of
the
prepaid
option
is
that
if
your
child
does
not
attend
college
or
chooses
to
attend
an
out
of
state
college
you
may
face
restrictions
or
penalties
in
withdrawing
the
funds

The
second
and
more
popular
option
is
where
you
can
choose
your
contribution
fund
as
an
investment
account
in
accordance
with
the
managing
agency
options

Plan
Flexibility
In
the
past
these
plans
were
more
rigid
but
with
the
passage
of
rule
changes
you
now
have
more
options
to
explore

If
you
child
who
is
a
beneficiary
has
graduated
and
there
is
still
money
in
your
plan
that
money
can
be
used
for
another
child
even
if
they
are
not
your
own

The
unexpended
money
can
be
used
to
assist
a
cousin
nephew
or
other
family
members
without
tax
consequences
so
long
as
it
is
used
for
qualified
education
expenses
or
for
qualifying
educational
institution
tuition

Let
s
not
also
forget
the
money
can
be
used
by
the
parent
if
he
or
she
decides
to
pursue
further
education

Another
flexible
option
is
for
you
to
convert
the
unexpended
funds
into
a
Roth
Individual
Retirement
Account
IRA


Yes
under
the
SECURE
Act


you
are
now
allowed
to
convert
that
money
into
an
IRA
for
your
kids
and
thereby
providing
them
with
a
jump
start
on
their
retirement
saving
plan

Further
you
can
leave
the
excess
or
unused
contributions
in
the
account
and
allow
it
to
grow
tax
free

There
is
no
statute
of
limitation
as
to
how
long
you
can
leave
your
contribution
in
your
state
sponsored
plan
which
also
allows
you
to
use
the
plan
for
your
grandchildren

Not
only
that
if
you
wanted
to
assist
your
child
with
their
student
loan
payments
the
funds
could
be
used
up
to


to
do
so

The
Takeaway
According
to
the
Education
Data
Initiative
only
of
families
use
a
college
saving
plan
such
as
to
help
prepare
them
to
face
the
rising
cost
of
education

This
show
that
not
enough
people
are
taking
advantage
of
this
tax
benefit
from
a
state
perspective
since
in
some
states
those
contributions
are
deductible

This
data
also
underscores
the
need
for
us
to
embrace
an
opportunity
to
give
a
gift
during
this
holiday
season
which
can
contribute
to
changing
a
child
s
life

You
might
want
to
reconsider
those
gifts
on
your
christmas
list
and
evaluate
where
you
can
have
greater
impact
both
now
and
in
the
future

When
It
s
Supposed
to
Be
The
Most
Wonderful
Time
of
the
Year
But
It
s
Not
A
Holiday
Gift
That
Makes
A
Difference
Ruthven
R
Phillip
Esq
We
have
entered
what
some
would
call
the
most
wonderful
time
of
the
year
with
holiday
shopping
food
football
friends
and
family

It
s
a
time
when
we
make
list
and
decide
on
who
will
get
what
gift
and
how
much
they
will
cost

But
this
holiday
season
i
am
suggesting
you
do
something
different
and
give
a
gift
that
can
change
a
young
person
s
life
or
have
lifelong
impact

What
I
am
referring
to
you
may
ask
I
am
referring
to
instead
of
making
that
traditional
gift
of
clothes
and
toys
how
about
making
a
gift
to
that
young
person
s
plan
for
educational
purposes

Sure
It
is
not
sexy
at
the
moment
but
it
can
provide
an
education
which
will
have
lasting
impact

What
are
Plans
A
plan
is
also
known
as
a
Qualified
Tuition
Program
which
came
into
existence
in


Each
program
is
administered
by
a
state
or
state
agency
and
allows
contributions
from
parents
friends
or
family
members
on
behalf
of
a
beneficiary
usually
a
child
or
children
into
this
fund

plans
are
widely
known
as
accounts
in
which
funds
are
deposited
saved
and
used
to
pay
for
future
educational
expenses

While
that
is
true
these
plans
can
also
be
used
tp
prepay
college
tuition
at
a
qualified
higher
education
institution

How
Does
It
Work
As
mentioned
there
are
two
ways
to
engage
in
a
plan

The
first
is
through
prepayment
of
a
child
s
educational
expenses
at
an
educational
institution

Contributing
through
this
option
allows
for
the
prepayment
of
all
or
a
portion
of
the
child
s
future
college
tuition
at
today
s
rates
which
can
protect
against
future
increases

The
idea
is
to
lock
in
your
contributions
and
thereby
your
investing
to
an
account
which
will
mirror
increases
in
tuition
rates
should
they
escalate

When
you
think
about
it
this
option
seems
likely
to
make
the
most
sense
but
there
are
some
significant
restrictions
associated

Using
the
prepaid
plans
means
that
they
can
only
be
applied
to
in
state
colleges

With
a
traditional
or
non
prepayment
plan
you
are
allowed
to
choose
the
investment
portfolio

However
with
a
prepayment
plan
you
are
not
allowed
to
choose
your
investments
since
the
plan
manager
is
focused
on
ensuring
that
your
investment
keeps
pace
with
raising
tuition
cost

Another
drawback
of
the
prepaid
option
is
that
if
your
child
does
not
attend
college
or
chooses
to
attend
an
out
of
state
college
you
may
face
restrictions
or
penalties
in
withdrawing
the
funds

The
second
and
more
popular
option
is
where
you
can
choose
your
contribution
fund
as
an
investment
account
in
accordance
with
the
managing
agency
options

Plan
Flexibility
In
the
past
these
plans
were
more
rigid
but
with
the
passage
of
rule
changes
you
now
have
more
options
to
explore

If
you
child
who
is
a
beneficiary
has
graduated
and
there
is
still
money
in
your
plan
that
money
can
be
used
for
another
child
even
if
they
are
not
your
own

The
unexpended
money
can
be
used
to
assist
a
cousin
nephew
or
other
family
members
without
tax
consequences
so
long
as
it
is
used
for
qualified
education
expenses
or
for
qualifying
educational
institution
tuition

Let
s
not
also
forget
the
money
can
be
used
by
the
parent
if
he
or
she
decides
to
pursue
further
education

Another
flexible
option
is
for
you
to
convert
the
unexpended
funds
into
a
Roth
Individual
Retirement
Account
IRA


Yes
under
the
SECURE
Act


you
are
now
allowed
to
convert
that
money
into
an
IRA
for
your
kids
and
thereby
providing
them
with
a
jump
start
on
their
retirement
saving
plan

Further
you
can
leave
the
excess
or
unused
contributions
in
the
account
and
allow
it
to
grow
tax
free

There
is
no
statute
of
limitation
as
to
how
long
you
can
leave
your
contribution
in
your
state
sponsored
plan
which
also
allows
you
to
use
the
plan
for
your
grandchildren

Not
only
that
if
you
wanted
to
assist
your
child
with
their
student
loan
payments
the
funds
could
be
used
up
to


to
do
so

The
Takeaway
According
to
the
Education
Data
Initiative
only
of
families
use
a
college
saving
plan
such
as
to
help
prepare
them
to
face
the
rising
cost
of
education

This
show
that
not
enough
people
are
taking
advantage
of
this
tax
benefit
from
a
state
perspective
since
in
some
states
those
contributions
are
deductible

This
data
also
underscores
the
need
for
us
to
embrace
an
opportunity
to
give
a
gift
during
this
holiday
season
which
can
contribute
to
changing
a
child
s
life

You
might
want
to
reconsider
those
gifts
on
your
christmas
list
and
evaluate
where
you
can
have
greater
impact
both
now
and
in
the
future

UP
