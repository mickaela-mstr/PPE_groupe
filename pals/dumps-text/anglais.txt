Urban
legend
v
t
e
Urban
legends
sometimes
modern
legend
urban
myth
or
simply
legend
is
a
genre
of
folklore
concerning
stories
about
an
unusual
usually
scary
or
humorous
event
that
many
people
believe
to
be
true
but
largely
are
not

These
legends
can
be
entertaining
but
often
concern
mysterious
peril
or
troubling
events
such
as
disappearances
and
strange
objects
or
entities

Urban
legends
may
confirm
moral
standards
reflect
prejudices
or
be
a
way
to
make
sense
of
societal
anxieties

In
the
past
urban
legends
were
most
often
circulated
orally
at
gatherings
and
around
the
campfire
for
instance

Now
they
can
be
spread
by
any
media
including
newspapers
mobile
news
apps
e
mail
and
most
often
social
media

Some
urban
legends
have
passed
through
the
years
decades
with
only
minor
changes
in
where
the
time
period
takes
place

Generic
urban
legends
are
often
altered
to
suit
regional
variations
but
the
lesson
or
moral
generally
remains
the
same

Origin
and
structure
edit
The
term
urban
legend
as
used
by
folklorists
has
appeared
in
print
since
at
least
when
it
was
used
by
Richard
Dorson

Jan
Harold
Brunvand
professor
of
English
at
the
University
of
Utah
introduced
the
term
to
the
general
public
in
a
series
of
popular
books
published
beginning
in


Brunvand
used
his
collection
of
legends
The
Vanishing
Hitchhiker
American
Urban
Legends
Their
Meanings
to
make
two
points
first
that
legends
and
folklore
do
not
occur
exclusively
in
so
called
primitive
or
traditional
societies
and
second
that
one
could
learn
much
about
urban
and
modern
culture
by
studying
such
tales

Many
urban
legends
are
framed
as
complete
stories
with
plot
and
characters

The
compelling
appeal
of
a
typical
urban
legend
is
its
elements
of
mystery
horror
fear
or
humor

Often
they
serve
as
cautionary
tales

Some
urban
legends
are
morality
tales
that
depict
someone
acting
in
a
disagreeable
manner
only
to
wind
up
in
trouble
hurt
or
dead

Urban
legends
will
often
try
to
invoke
a
feeling
of
disgust
in
the
reader
which
tends
to
make
these
stories
more
memorable
and
potent

Elements
of
shock
value
can
be
found
in
almost
every
form
of
urban
legend
and
are
partially
what
makes
these
tales
so
impactful

An
urban
legend
may
include
elements
of
the
supernatural
or
paranormal

Propagation
and
belief
edit
As
Jan
Brunvand
points
out
antecedent
legends
including
some
of
the
motifs
themes
and
symbolism
of
the
urtexts
can
readily
be
identified

Cases
that
may
have
been
at
least
partially
inspired
by
real
events
include
The
Death
Car
traced
by
Richard
Dorson
to
Michigan
United
States
the
Solid
Cement
Cadillac
and
the
possible
origin
of
The
Hook
in
the
series
of
Lovers
Lane
murders
in
Texarkana
Texas
United
States

The
urban
legend
that
Coca
Cola
developed
the
drink
Fanta
to
sell
in
Nazi
Germany
without
public
backlash
originated
as
the
actual
tale
of
German
Max
Keith
who
invented
the
drink
and
ran
Coca
Cola
s
operations
in
Germany
during
World
War
II

The
narrator
of
an
urban
legend
may
claim
it
happened
to
a
friend
or
to
a
friend
of
a
friend
which
serves
to
personalize
authenticate
and
enhance
the
power
of
the
narrative
while
distancing
the
teller
from
the
tall
tale

Many
urban
legends
depict
horrific
crimes
contaminated
foods
or
other
situations
that
would
potentially
affect
many
people

Anyone
believing
such
stories
might
feel
compelled
to
warn
loved
ones

On
occasion
news
organizations
school
officials
and
even
police
departments
have
issued
warnings
concerning
the
latest
threat

According
to
the
Lights
Out
rumor
street
gang
members
would
drive
without
headlights
until
a
compassionate
motorist
responded
with
the
traditional
flashing
of
headlights
whereupon
a
prospective
new
gang
member
would
have
to
murder
the
citizen
as
a
requirement
of
initiation

A
fax
retelling
this
legend
received
at
the
Nassau
County
Florida
fire
department
was
forwarded
to
police
and
from
there
to
all
city
departments

The
Minister
of
Defence
for
Canada
was
taken
in
by
it
also
he
forwarded
an
urgent
security
warning
to
all
Ontario
Members
of
Parliament

Urban
legends
typically
include
common
elements
the
tale
is
retold
on
behalf
of
the
original
witness
or
participant
dire
warnings
are
often
given
for
those
who
might
not
heed
the
advice
or
lesson
contained
therein
a
typical
element
of
many
e
mail
phishing
scams
and
the
tale
is
often
touted
as
something
a
friend
told
me
the
friend
being
identified
by
first
name
only
or
not
identified
at
all

Such
legends
seem
to
be
believable
and
even
provocative
as
some
readers
are
led
in
turn
to
pass
them
on
including
on
social
media
platforms
that
instantly
reach
millions
worldwide

Many
are
essentially
extended
jokes
told
as
if
they
were
true
events

Persistent
urban
legends
do
often
maintain
a
degree
of
plausibility
as
in
the
story
a
serial
killer
deliberately
hiding
in
the
back
seat
of
a
car

Another
such
example
since
the
s
has
been
the
recurring
rumor
that
the
Procter
Gamble
Company
was
associated
with
Satan
worshippers
because
of
details
within
its
th
century
trademark

The
legend
interrupted
the
company
s
business
to
the
point
that
it
stopped
using
the
trademark

Relation
to
mythology
edit
The
earliest
term
by
which
these
narratives
were
known
urban
belief
tales
highlights
what
was
then
thought
of
as
a
key
property
their
tellers
regarded
the
stories
as
true
accounts
and
the
device
of
the
FOAF
acronym
for
Friend
of
a
Friend
invented
by
English
writer
and
folklorist
Rodney
Dale
in
was
a
spurious
but
significant
effort
at
authentication

The
coinage
leads
in
turn
to
the
terms
FOAFlore
and
FOAFtale


While
at
least
one
classic
legend
the
Death
Car
has
been
shown
to
have
some
basis
in
fact
folklorists
have
an
interest
in
debunking
those
narratives
only
to
the
degree
that
establishing
non
factuality
warrants
the
assumption
that
there
must
be
some
other
reason
why
the
tales
are
told
re
told
and
believed

As
in
the
case
of
myth
the
narratives
are
believed
because
they
construct
and
reinforce
the
worldview
of
the
group
within
which
they
are
told
or
because
they
provide
us
with
coherent
and
convincing
explanations
of
complex
events


Social
scientists
have
started
to
draw
on
urban
legends
in
order
to
help
explain
complex
socio
psychological
beliefs
such
as
attitudes
to
crime
childcare
fast
food
SUVs
and
other
family
choices

The
authors
make
an
explicit
connection
between
urban
legends
and
popular
folklore
such
as
Grimm
s
Fairy
Tales
where
similar
themes
and
motifs
arise

For
that
reason
it
is
characteristic
of
groups
within
which
a
given
narrative
circulates
to
vehemently
reject
claims
or
demonstrations
of
non
factuality
an
example
would
be
the
expressions
of
outrage
by
police
officers
who
are
told
that
adulteration
of
Halloween
treats
by
strangers
the
subject
of
periodic
moral
panics
occurs
extremely
rarely
if
at
all

Documentation
edit
The
Internet
has
made
it
easier
both
to
spread
and
to
debunk
urban
legends

For
instance
the
Usenet
newsgroup
alt
folklore
urban
and
several
other
websites
most
notably
snopes
com
focus
on
discussing
tracking
and
analyzing
urban
legends

The
United
States
Department
of
Energy
had
a
now
discontinued
service
called
Hoaxbusters
that
dealt
with
computer
distributed
hoaxes
and
legends

The
most
notable
such
hoaxes
are
known
as
creepypastas
which
are
typically
horror
stories
written
anonymously

Although
most
are
regarded
as
obviously
false
some
such
as
the
Slender
Man
have
gained
a
following
of
people
that
do
believe
in
them

Television
shows
such
as
Urban
Legends
Beyond
Belief
Fact
or
Fiction
and
later
Mostly
True
Stories
Urban
Legends
Revealed
feature
re
enactments
of
urban
legends
detailing
the
accounts
of
the
tales
and
typically
later
in
an
episode
revealing
any
factual
basis
they
may
have

The
Discovery
Channel
TV
show
MythBusters
tried
to
prove
or
disprove
several
urban
legends
by
attempting
to
reproduce
them
using
the
scientific
method

The
film
Urban
Legend
featured
students
discussing
popular
urban
legends
while
at
the
same
time
falling
victim
to
killings
re
enacting
them

The
film
The
Blair
Witch
Project
purposefully
positioned
itself
as
an
urban
legend
to
gain
viral
hype
and
succeeded
in
fooling
many
that
it
was
based
on
a
real
disappearance

The
lack
of
widespread
social
media
and
search
engines
helped
it
proliferate
in
the
months
leading
up
to
its
release

Between
and
The
Guardian
newspaper
Weekend
section
published
the
illustrated
Urban
Myths
column
by
Phil
Healey
and
Rick
Glanvill
with
content
taken
from
a
series
of
four
books
Urban
Myths
The
Return
of
Urban
Myths
Urban
Myths
Unplugged
and
Now
That
s
What
I
Call
Urban
Myths

The
comics
anthology
the
Big
Book
of
Urban
Legends
written
by
Robert
Boyd
Jan
Harold
Brunvand
and
Robert
Loren
Fleming
featured
urban
legends
displayed
as
comics

citation
needed
The
British
writer
Tony
Barrell
has
explored
urban
legends
in
a
long
running
column
in
The
Sunday
Times

These
include
the
story
that
Orson
Welles
began
work
on
a
Batman
movie
in
the
s
which
was
to
feature
James
Cagney
as
the
Riddler
and
Marlene
Dietrich
as
Catwoman
the
persistent
rumour
that
the
rock
singer
Courtney
Love
is
the
granddaughter
of
Marlon
Brando
and
the
idea
that
a
famous
s
poster
of
Farrah
Fawcett
contains
a
subliminal
sexual
message
concealed
in
the
actress
s
hair

Genres
edit
Crime
edit
As
with
traditional
urban
legends
many
internet
rumors
are
about
crimes
or
crime
waves
either
fictional
or
based
on
real
events
that
have
been
largely
exaggerated

Such
stories
can
be
problematic
both
because
they
purport
to
be
relevant
modern
news
and
because
they
do
not
follow
the
typical
patterns
of
urban
legends

Medicine
edit
Some
legends
are
medical
folklore
such
as
the
claim
that
eating
watermelon
seeds
will
result
in
a
watermelon
growing
in
the
stomach
or
that
going
outdoors
just
after
showering
will
result
in
catching
a
cold

Many
old
wives
tales
have
grown
around
the
identification
of
ailments
real
and
imagined
and
the
recommended
remedies
rituals
and
home
grown
medical
treatments
to
treat
them

citation
needed
Internet
edit
Internet
urban
legends
are
those
spread
through
the
internet
as
through
Usenet
or
email
or
more
recently
through
other
social
media

They
can
also
be
linked
to
viral
online
content

Some
take
the
form
of
chain
letters
and
spread
by
e
mail
directing
the
reader
to
share
them
or
to
meet
a
terrible
fate
and
following
a
recognizable
outline
of
hook
threat
and
finally
request

Paranormal
edit
Paranormal
urban
legend
stories
usually
involve
someone
encountering
something
supernatural
such
as
a
cryptid
for
instance
Bigfoot
or
Mothman
legendary
creatures
for
which
evidence
is
lacking
but
which
have
legions
of
believers

Research
shows
that
people
experiencing
sudden
or
surprising
events
such
as
a
Bigfoot
sighting
may
significantly
overestimate
the
duration
of
the
event

Marketing
edit
Companies
have
been
accused
of
hiding
secret
messages
behind
their
logos
or
packaging
as
in
the
case
of
the
old
Procter
Gamble
symbol
supposedly
an
occult
figure
that
gave
panache
to
the
brand

If
the
thirteen
stars
in
the
symbol
were
connected
a
certain
way
it
would
show
three
sixes
in
a
row
or
looked
at
the
curls
at
the
bottom
they
form
the
inverted
s

Similarly
a
video
of
a
Christian
woman
exposing
Monster
Energy
for
using
the
Hebrew
letter
vav
forming
the
letter
M
to
disguise
the
number
went
viral
on
Facebook

The

Washington

You
know
The
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollow
from
the
countless
movies
cartoons
and
other
adaptations

The
tale
of
Rip
Van
Winkle
is
thoroughly
ingrained
in
American
culture

But
how
about
the
man
behind
the
stories
As
it
turns
out
Washington
Irving
s
life
was
just
as
interesting
as
the
books
he
wrote

Here
are
things
you
might
not
know
about
America
s
first
international
best
selling
author



Irving
was
the
last
of
children
eight
of
whom
lived
into
adulthood

His
older
brothers
often
supported
him
as
he
pursued
his
writing
interests
and
he
started
the
literary
magazine
Salmagundi
with
his
brother
William



He
was
named
after
George
Washington

Irving
was
born
in
the
same
year
the
American
Revolution
came
to
an
end

He
was
named
after
the
war
hero
and
attended
Washington
s
inauguration
when
he
was
years
old

In
fact
historians
think
that
Irving
s
account
of
Washington
s
swearing
in
created
the
now
challenged
story
that
Washington
added
So
help
me
God
to
his
oath
of
office



In
yellow
fever
had
reached
epidemic
proportions
in
New
York
with
over
deaths

Fear
of
the
disease
drove
the
family
to
send
Irving
to
stay
with
a
friend
in
Tarrytown

It
was
here
that
he
would
have
gotten
to
know
Sleepy
Hollow
which
was
to
become
the
setting
of
course
of
his
most
famous
story
The
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollow



As
a
reporter
for
his
brother
Peter
s
newspaper
The
Morning
Chronicle
Irving
covered
Aaron
Burr
s
treason
trial

He
described
the
courtroom
meeting
of
Burr
and
his
adversary
General
James
Wilkinson
saying
Burr
turned
his
head
looked
him
full
in
the
face
with
one
of
his
piercing
regards
swept
his
eye
over
his
whole
person
from
head
to
foot
as
if
to
scan
his
dimensions
then
coolly
resumed
his
former
position



He
was
engaged
to
Matilda
Hoffman
in
but
she
died
of
tuberculosis
before
they
were
wed

Irving
was
devastated
and
never
married

Years
later
he
wrote
to
a
friend
about
her
death
saying
For
years
I
could
not
talk
on
the
subject
of
this
hopeless
regret
I
could
not
even
mention
her
name
but
her
image
was
continually
before
me
and
I
dreamt
of
her
incessantly



Irving
not
only
coined
the
word
Gotham
as
a
nickname
for
New
York
City
he
also
helped
establish
the
use
of
knickerbocker
as
a
name
for
New
Yorkers

Gotham
was
the
name
of
the
city
lampooned
in
stories
is
his
literary
magazine

Knickerbocker
was
adapted
from
his
book
A
History
of
New
York
From
the
Beginning
of
the
World
to
the
End
of
the
Dutch
Dynasty
by
Diederich
Knickerbocker

Irving
was
also
the
origin
of
the
phrase
the
almighty
dollar
having
written
in
The
Creole
Village
The
almighty
dollar
that
great
object
of
universal
devotion
throughout
our
land
seems
to
have
no
genuine
devotees
in
these
peculiar
villages
and
unless
some
of
its
missionaries
penetrate
there
and
erect
banking
houses
and
other
pious
shrines
there
is
no
knowing
how
long
the
inhabitants
may
remain
in
their
present
state
of
contented
poverty



It
wouldn
t
be
a
very
merry
Christmas
without
Irving

In
a
time
when
Christmas
wasn
t
widely
celebrated
Irving
helped
create
the
modern
image
of
Santa
Claus
in
A
History
of
New
York

He
wrote
about
a
man
who
dreamt
that
the
good
St

Nicholas
came
riding
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
in
that
self
same
wagon
wherein
he
brings
his
yearly
presents
to
children

He
continued
to
foster
the
Christmas
tradition
in
The
Sketch
Book
of
Geoffrey
Crayon
Gent

with
stories
like
Christmas
Eve
which
describes
the
then
little
known
tradition
of
hanging
mistletoe



Irving
also
had
a
hand
in
inventing
the
myth
that
people
in
the
Middle
Ages
thought
the
world
was
flat

In
Irving
s
book
A
History
of
the
Life
and
Voyages
of
Christopher
Columbus
he
fictionalizes
the
meeting
of
the
Spanish
commission
that
examines
Columbus
expedition
plan
with
members
of
the
committee
raising
objections
to
the
idea
that
world
was
round

Readers
accepted
Irving
s
version
as
truth
but
in
reality
the
educated
class
would
have
long
accepted
the
idea
of
a
round
earth



He
bought
his
riverside
home
Sunnyside
in
for
and
he
died
of
a
heart
attack
in
his
bedroom
in


The
home
was
quite
the
tourist
attraction
with
Oliver
Wendell
Holmes
Sr

writing
that
Sunnyside
was
next
to
Mount
Vernon
the
best
known
and
most
cherished
of
all
the
dwellings
in
our
land



In
Irving
was
the
first
author
to
be
featured
on
the
Famous
Americans
series
stamps

Other
authors
included
in
the
series
were
James
Fenimore
Cooper
Ralph
Waldo
Emerson
Louisa
May
Alcott
and
Samuel
Clemens

We
all
know
that
the
Slender
Man
is
nothing
more
than
a
pure
urban
legend
created
online
in
on
an
Internet
forum

However
since
then
it
has
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own
even
being
connected
with
several
attempted
murders
as
well
as
a
spate
of
suicides
and
a
possible
mass
suicide
attempt

While
nobody
is
arguing
that
the
Slender
Man
is
real
at
least
in
the
physical
sense
the
belief
in
him
by
some
has
made
the
consequences
of
the
legend
very
real
for
some

Here
are
ten
very
unsettling
points
about
the
legend
and
reality
of
the
Slender
Man

Unlike
many
other
legends
and
myths
the
origins
of
the
Slender
Man
can
be
traced
to
the
exact
date
of
its
creation

At
some
point
on
June
the
Internet
forum
Something
Awful
unleashed
two
photographs

They
were
created
by
user
Victor
Surge
whose
real
name
was
eventually
revealed
to
be
Eric
Knudsen


He
had
created
them
in
response
to
a
challenge
by
the
forum
s
admin
to
create
paranormal
images
that
might
make
people
believe
they
were
genuine

The
first
picture
dating
from
showed
a
group
of
children
looking
upset
and
frightened

In
the
background
is
a
discreet
extraordinarily
tall
faceless
man

The
caption
read
We
didn
t
want
to
go
we
didn
t
want
to
kill
them
but
its
persistent
silence
and
outstretched
arms
horrified
us
and
comforted
us
at
the
same
time
That
quote
was
attributed
to
the
unknown
photographer
who
was
presumed
dead

The
second
picture
was
dated
three
years
later
in


It
showed
children
looking
altogether
happier
while
playing
in
a
park

Discreetly
though
the
same
tall
figure
can
be
seen
lurking
in
the
background

The
caption
informed
those
who
viewed
the
picture
that
it
was
one
of
two
recovered
photographs
from
the
Stirling
City
Library
blaze

It
also
stated
that
the
photo
was
taken
the
day
which
fourteen
children
vanished
and
even
referenced
Slender
Man

This
time
the
photographer
was
named
as
Mary
Thomas
who
had
been
missing
since
June


These
two
pictures
not
only
gave
birth
to
the
Slender
Man
legends
but
they
also
captivated
thousands
upon
thousands
of
people
almost
immediately

Although
Knudsen
was
responsible
for
the
Slender
Man
s
creation
it
would
be
the
many
followers
of
Creepypasta
who
would
truly
bring
him
to
life

As
more
and
more
people
became
aware
of
Slender
Man
and
added
their
own
details
and
little
pieces
of
the
backstory
the
legend
grew

He
was
often
depicted
with
a
white
featureless
face
and
was
slim
abnormally
tall
and
often
with
tentacles
coming
from
his
back

He
also
became
associated
with
abandoned
buildings
often
in
the
wilderness
or
the
woods

Some
details
added
later
even
claimed
that
the
Slender
Man
could
teleport
from
one
place
to
another

Those
who
were
interested
in
the
Slender
Man
even
agreed
signs
that
he
was
near
and
watching
you

Such
signs
as
sudden
paranoia
nosebleeds
and
intense
nightmares

In
fact
this
creation
of
a
legend
by
the
audience
themselves
is
the
subject
of
our
next
point

How
this
growth
can
be
monitored
and
studied
by
those
who
study
myths
and
folklore
of
the
past

Many
who
study
legends
folklore
and
mythology
have
looked
at
the
Slender
Man
legends
as
a
way
of
being
able
to
document
its
growth
and
reach

And
in
doing
so
they
look
to
understand
how
legends
of
the
past
might
have
developed
and
grown
in
a
similar
way

For
example
there
is
a
collective
element
to
the
growth
of
the
Slender
Man
legend
as
we
examined
above

What
s
more
slight
details
change
depending
on
who
is
telling
the
tale
or
who
the
audience
might
be

Indeed
the
more
accounts
that
were
retold
of
the
Slender
Man
online
as
opposed
to
orally
in
this
case
the
more
the
legend
and
the
backstory
grew

The
Slender
Man
legend
had
very
quickly
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own
much
like
myths
and
folklore
of
the
past

However
several
years
after
his
creation
the
Slender
Man
became
real
in
a
much
grittier
way

On
May
the
Slender
Man
or
at
least
the
consequences
of
the
legend
spilled
over
into
the
real
world
in
a
very
dramatic
way

On
the
morning
in
question
two
year
old
girls
Anissa
Weier
and
Morgan
Geyser
attempted
to
murder
their
friend
Payton
Leutner
by
stabbing
her
multiple
times
in
the
woods

After
being
left
for
dead
she
eventually
stumbled
out
and
was
discovered
by
a
passing
cyclist

The
girls
were
arrested
a
short
time
later

When
questioned
Weier
claimed
they
had
launched
the
attack
in
order
to
please
the
Slender
Man

What
s
more
they
also
believed
they
knew
where
the
Slender
Man
lived
an
old
house
in
the
Nicolet
National
Forest
a
location
they
were
on
their
way
to
when
they
were
arrested

For
all
intents
and
purposes
it
could
be
argued
that
for
the
attackers
and
their
victim
alike
the
Slender
Man
or
the
consequences
of
him
were
very
real

Incidentally
Weier
was
released
from
a
mental
health
facility
in
the
summer
of


Geyser
on
the
other
hand

incarcerated

Payton
Leutner

the
nineteen

she

Following
the
attempted
murder
of
Payton
Leutner
several
copycat
cases
occurred
all
with
various
connections
to
the
Slender
Man
legends

For
example
only
weeks
later
in
June
in
Hamilton
County
Ohio
a
year
old
girl
attacked
her
mother
with
a
knife

In
the
investigation
that
followed
it
was
discovered
that
she
had
an
obsession
with
the
Slender
Man

Several
months
after
that
in
September
in
Port
Richey
Florida
a
year
old
girl
set
fire
to
her
family
home

According
to
reports
she
was
inspired
by
the
Slender
Man
to
do
so

Incidentally
all
of
those
inside
escaped
the
burning
building
and
the
young
girl
was
arrested
the
following
morning

Even
the
murders
of
two
police
officers
and
a
member
of
the
public
in
Las
Vegas
in
the
summer
of
followed
by
the
suicide
of
the
alleged
killer
and
his
wife
was
connected
to
the
Slender
Man
after
neighbors
told
the
media
that
he
would
often
dress
up
as
the
Internet
legend
and
parade
around
his
house
and
yard

In
the
summer
of
The
New
York
Times
published
an
article
detailing
the
suicides
of
multiple
young
people
between
the
ages
of
and
who
had
committed
suicide
on
the
Pine
Ridge
Reservation
in
South
Dakota
in
the
previous
six
months
alone

What
is
particularly
interesting
about
this
wave
of
suicides
is
that
the
article
also
claimed
that
several
officials
with
knowledge
of
the
cases
said
that
at
least
one
of
the
youths
who
committed
suicide
was
influenced
by
Slender
Man

What
is
further
interesting
about
the
alleged
connections
to
the
Slender
Man
legends
and
these
tragic
deaths
are
legends
of
the
reservation
itself

They
speak
of
a
spirit
named
the
Tall
Man
or
Walking
Sam

What
this
spirit
did
was
to
encourage
those
he
chose
to
visit
to
take
their
own
lives

It
is
perhaps
a
coincidence
that
there
are
similarities
between
the
legends
of
the
Slender
Man
and
these
Native
American
legends

However
the
coming
together
of
them
within
this
reservation
s
community
very
well
might
have
resulted
in
tragic
consequences

A
particularly
grim
account
tells
of
a
narrowly
aborted
mass
suicide
at
the
same
reservation
mentioned
above

According
to
the
story
multiple
teenagers
suddenly
set
out
to
a
specific
spot
in
the
woods
and
started
preparing
ropes
by
tying
them
to
the
branches
of
the
trees

They
were
clearly
planning
on
committing
suicide
hanging
themselves
together
as
a
group

The
local
pastor
on
the
reservation
John
Two
Bulls
heard
of
the
morose
plans
and
immediately
set
out
to
the
location

He
fortunately
managed
to
halt
the
proceedings
and
seemingly
bring
the
group
out
of
whatever
mass
trance
they
appeared
to
have
been
in

Rumblings
from
the
reservation
claimed
that
the
cause
of
the
attempted
mass
suicide
was
a
result
of
the
visitation
of
Walking
Sam

Given
the
publicity
that
the
Slender
Man
was
receiving
at
this
stage
it
is
perhaps
easy
to
understand
how
some
in
the
media
connected
the
legend
of
the
suicide
spirit
and
this
new
urban
legend

Paranormal
author
and
researcher
Nick
Redfern
relayed
a
particularly
intriguing
account
that
was
told
to
him

The
witness
who
he
gave
the
name
Lacy
would
claim
to
have
had
several
real
life
encounters
with
the
Slender
Man
although
not
physical
encounters

She
would
claim
that
she
had
been
researching
the
Slender
Man
for
several
months

Then
one
evening
her
laptop
which
was
on
sleep
mode
suddenly
switched
on
of
its
own
accord

To
her
shock
an
image
of
a
faceless
creature
was
on
the
screen

Within
a
few
seconds
it
was
gone

She
told
herself
she
must
have
imagined
it

However
two
nights
later
the
laptop
once
more
switched
on
of
its
own
accord

When
it
did
the
face
appeared
again
only
this
time
it
was
much
clearer

Things
went
quiet
for
several
weeks
and
Lacy
had
almost
forgotten
the
incidents

That
was
until
her
laptop
came
on
again

This
time
a
strange
voice
came
from
the
device
stating
we
are
friends

It
was
at
this
point
that
Lacy
shut
the
laptop
down
and
ceased
her
research
into
the
Slender
Man
legends

It
is
easy
and
perhaps
right
to
suggest
that
what
Lacy
experienced
at
best
were
hallucinations
brought
on
by
her
intense
interest
in
and
subconscious
fear
of
the
Slender
Man
legends

It
is
interesting
to
note
once
more
though
that
the
fine
line
in
a
person
believing
in
a
legend
suddenly
making
it
real
is
indeed
delicate
in
the
extreme

What
If

Watch

As
we
might
imagine
a
fierce
debate
ensued
following
the
attempting
stabbing
and
the
copycat
cases
that
followed

And
while
it
concentrated
on
the
Slender
Man
at
first
it
soon
moved
on
to
the
Internet
and
the
influence
it
has
on
children
in
general

For
example
in
the
Waukesha
School
District
where
the
attempted
murder
of
Payton
Leutner
took
place
Creepypasta
Wiki
was
blocked

For
their
part
the
administrators
of
the
website
claimed
that
the
stabbing
was
an
isolated
incident

They
also
claimed
their
website
was
a
literary
one
and
not
one
that
condoned
murder

Ultimately
it
was
reasoned
that
all
manner
of
films
TV
programs
and
video
games
that
children
had
access
to
did
not
result
in
such
atrocious
attacks

In
short
the
problem
was
with
the
attackers
themselves
as
opposed
to
the
apparent
catalyst

Although
the
debate
originally
had
momentum
the
more
it
went
on
the
less
sway
it
had

There
is
little
doubt
that
the
Slender
Man
is
the
Boogeyman
of
the
modern
age

If
you
talk
to
anyone
in
the
western
world
under
the
age
of
it
is
almost
certain
they
will
know
who
the
Slender
Man
is

They
might
not
know
the
history
or
even
how
they
heard
of
him
but
the
fact
is
they
know

And
although
they
understand
at
least
for
the
most
part
that
he
is
nothing
more
than
an
urban
legend
he
is
without
a
doubt
in
their
collective
subconscious

There
are
certainly
very
definite
similarities
between
the
Slender
Man
and
the
Boogeyman

Both
are
on
the
prowl
for
children
for
example
and
both
have
grim
abodes
in
out
of
the
way
locations
often
in
the
woods

Of
course
where
the
legend
of
the
Slender
Man
goes
from
here
remains
to
be
seen

Perhaps
he
will
still
be
spoken
in
hundreds
of
years
by
spooked
youngsters
around
the
world
as
much
as
he
is
today

The
Legend
of
Arsene
Wenger
If
Arsene
Wenger
s
career
was
a
kung
fu
movie
we
would
be
in
the
part
where
the
search
is
on
for
the
villain
who
poisoned
Arsene
s
rice

Taking
cues
from
the
charismatic
Frenchman
all
eyes
would
be
on
the
usual
suspects
the
media
referees
disloyal
players
Roy
Keane
Sam
Allardyce
and
the
most
obvious
targets
those
pin
stripe
suited
figures
throwing
around
Scrooge
McDuck
money
for
fun

But
this
film
s
twist
is
that
Arsene
may
have
stubbornly
poisoned
his
own
rice

Without
question
Arsene
Wenger
s
footballing
philosophy
is
the
stuff
of
legends
the
kind
of
stuff
that
inevitably
leads
to
statues
and
shops
with
corny
names

It
is
a
presence
in
football
that
can
t
quite
be
contextualized
and
fully
appreciated
until
you
run
down
a
laundry
list
of
coaches
and
realize
how
few
have
recognizable
philosophies
capable
of
lining
up
with
the
world
s
great
isms
communism
socialism
capitalism
Barcelonaism

But
as
with
all
great
isms
there
s
a
downside
and
Wengerism
is
no
exception
to
this
time
tested
rule

As
a
great
man
who
I
may
have
made
up
once
said
Shifting
landscapes
wait
for
no
philosophy

Back
in
Wengerism
took
the
world
by
surprise
and
by
world
of
course
I
mean
England

Arsene
was
a
career
coach
with
multiple
successes
under
his
belt
but
his
body
of
work
didn
t
quite
resonate
on
a
global
scale
until
he
replicated
his
successes
at
Arsenal
transforming
the
club
and
English
football
along
the
way

His
philosophy
was
built
by
tapping
into
a
continental
pool
of
players
that
had
yet
to
be
realized
or
trusted
by
his
peers
in
England

Add
the
Japanese
inspired
modifications
to
the
traditional
English
training
regimen
and
some
good
old
fashioned
outside
the
box
thinking
and
the
insightful
Arsene
was
well
on
his
way
to
transforming
an
English
league
that
in
many
ways
was
in
desperate
need
of
modernization

Wengerism
quickly
became
easily
identifiable

Movement
pace
obscene
technical
ability
disregard
for
passports
and
a
dedication
to
healthy
living
collectively
became
Arsene
s
ayahuasca
an
Amazonian
psychedelic
drug
thought
to
transform
how
you
view
the
world


Over
his
first
few
years
England
stood
transfixed
as
if
in
a
drug
induced
state

The
world
inhaled

And
then
inhaled
again

I
certainly
did

Multiple
times

Few
could
outrun
Wenger
s
newest
disciples
an
amalgamation
of
good
old
fashioned
Englishmen
seemingly
random
foreigners
and
a
superhero
Dutchman
who
was
scared
of
flying

The
trophies
were
immediate
and
people
soon
began
lining
up
around
the
corner
to
devour
the
teachings
on
tap
at
Highbury

Suddenly
a
Frenchman
was
the
philosopher
king
of
English
football

He
was
The
Professor
the
robed
noble
Frenchman
sitting
on
the
side
of
the
pitch
with
his
Coke
bottle
glasses
telling
the
world
that
the
era
of
English
football
as
we
knew
it
was
over

Fini

Mesmerized
slightly
disoriented
fans
and
media
types
weren
t
the
only
ones
to
succumb
to
Wengerism

Arsene
susceptible
to
the
trappings
of
success
just
like
previous
purveyors
of
transformative
thought
also
bought
into
Wengerism

And
that
s
where
the
trouble
begins

No
philosophy
not
even
the
most
transformative
should
go
unchallenged
forever

Looking
at
the
human
record
there
are
countless
examples
of
what
happens
when
individuals
develop
philosophies
that
successfully
end
up
radically
transforming
thought
and
or
behavior

Often
these
typically
charismatic
figures
peak
which
is
then
followed
by
a
slow
procession
into
a
delusional
state
characterized
by
a
fierce
bond
to
the
glory
days
and
a
perpetual
belief
that
a
formula
that
was
once
all
the
rage
will
be
so
again

It
s
just
a
matter
of
time
isn
t
it
That
s
the
worrying
and
poisonous
component
of
success

Sure
it
s
not
an
absolute
it
doesn
t
cripple
everyone

But
Arsene
s
steadfast
reliance
on
a
philosophy
that
initially
brought
success
just
might
be
the
very
poison
that
leads
to
his
demise

Said
another
way
Arsene
may
have
unknowingly
betrayed
himself

Arsene
transformed
football
by
keeping
his
mind
open
to
new
approaches
and
angles

He
absorbed
what
leagues
and
cultures
had
to
offer
and
hit
the
English
scene
at
the
right
time
with
the
right
recipe

But
since
then
one
way
to
view
Arsene
s
stance
is
that
he
has
stood
still
staunch
in
his
belief
that
his
philosophy
is
the
end

The
irony
is
that
this
highly
cerebral
being
may
have
reached
a
point
of
success
only
to
discard
the
one
thing
that
brought
him
success
an
open
mind

All
philosophies
must
evolve
and
like
all
hardened
souls
who
have
doubled
down
on
their
philosophies
as
gospel
after
initial
successes
learn
being
right
and
successful
at
a
specific
point
in
time
doesn
t
make
you
right
for
eternity
or
right
under
all
conditions

The
Arsenal
philosophy
worked
with
a
certain
set
of
players
at
a
certain
point
in
time
in
a
certain
market
almost
to
perfection

But
unfortunately
for
Arsenal
we
no
longer
live
in
that
world

Arsene
no
longer
has
the
jump
on
foreign
markets

No
longer
are
there
remote
corners
of
the
globe

Globalization
has
arrived
and
what
was
once
Wenger
s
Coca
Cola
formula
is
now
public
knowledge

Now
the
race
for
continental
talent
the
talent
necessary
to
execute
football
The
Arsenal
Way
can
be
purchased
by
anyone
with
access
to
mines
oil
or
vast
resources
of
chicken

No
longer
is
Arsene
s
spell
alone
enough
to
draw
players
who
can
now
express
themselves
at
much
higher
salaries
elsewhere

Yet
for
some
reason
we
still
reflexively
talk
about
sexy
football
at
Arsenal

Why
If
we
are
being
honest
sexy
football
hasn
t
been
around
for
some
time

All
you
need
to
do
is
look
at
the
style
that
was
on
display
at
Highbury
a
decade
ago
which
admittedly
is
a
high
standard
for
any
team
to
see
how
the
latest
versions
of
the
team
are
much
closer
to
Inconvincible
than
Invincible

Check
your
bowl
Arsene
may
have
poisoned
your
rice
too

We
re
all
wondering
how
this
movie
ends

Does
Arsene
take
his
own
life
by
continuing
to
eat
his
poisoned
rice
or
is
there
another
twist
a
twist
where
the
director
reveals
that
Arsene
has
actually
mastered
skills
taught
at
competing
monasteries
and
defeats
Manchester
City
in
the
final
fight
scene
using
Qatar
style
At
first
glance
changing
Arsene
may
be
as
difficult
a
task
as
convincing
Chairman
Mao
to
accept
capitalism
or
convincing
Richard
Dawkins
to
accept
Jesus
as
his
savior

But
regardless
of
what
he
decides
the
landscape
around
him
will
continue
to
change

That
is
inevitable

It
is
also
likely
we
will
inevitably
learn
that
training
young
players
to
compete
The
Arsenal
Way
only
to
break
through
and
find
out
that
other
teams
have
already
explored
the
world
and
brought
in
experienced
players
already
capable
of
playing
The
Arsenal
Way
while
selling
farm
raised
Arsenal
Way
players
to
these
same
clubs
is
a
suspect
formula
and
one
that
looks
to
be
unsustainable

Arsene
has
a
strong
commendable
philosophy
but
if
he
wants
to
continue
being
a
savior
and
avoid
end
of
career
buffoonery
and
caricature
he
must
learn
to
proactively
introduce
experienced
serious
talent
into
his
team
or
risk
losing
the
reputation
that
he
has
spent
his
life
rightfully
developing

I
wish
it
didn
t
work
that
way

It
isn
t
fair

But
it
is
and
today
reputations
are
easier
than
ever
to
build

They
are
also
notoriously
easy
to
dismantle
bastardize
and
destroy

But
it
isn
t
all
doom
and
gloom

If
you
are
wearing
your
prescription
rose
tinted
glasses
the
potentially
good
news
is
that
Arsene
already
knows
all
of
this

It
has
now
come
out
that
back
when
Arsenal
was
in
desperate
need
for
a
goalkeeper
they
bid
million
for
Liverpool
s
Pepe
Reina

They
seemingly
made
bids
for
Borussia
Dortmund
playmaker
Mario
G
tze
Lyon
playmaker
Yoann
Gourcuff
Rennes
holding
midfielder
Yann
M
Vila
and
maybe
even
Lille
hotshot
Eden
Hazard

Each
of
these
bids
and
these
are
only
some
of
the
ones
that
have
surfaced
would
have
broken
Arsenal
s
record
transfer
fee

These
bids
suggest
one
important
thing
Arsene
knows
and
he
s
now
willing
to
spend
well
beyond
what
he
has
spent
in
the
past

Whether
he
s
willing
to
spend
enough
is
another
question

So
the
potentially
good
news
for
Arsenal
fans
is
that
Arsene
s
poisoned
rice
may
not
kill
him
but
rather
might
have
strengthened
his
immunity
and
expanded
his
powers

He
may
just
be
waiting
for
the
right
moment
in
the
movie
to
maintain
the
appropriate
level
of
suspense

If
this
is
the
case
this
kung
fu
movie
may
have
one
last
hilarious
unexpected
turn

In
the
meantime
keep
your
eye
on
your
rice

This
much
debated
photo
from
may
be
iconic
but
the
legend
of
the
Loch

Monster
dates
back
to
before
the
Roman
invasion
of
the
region

birth
of
a
legend
When
the
Romans
first
came
to
northern
Scotland
in
the
first
century
A
D

they
found
the
Highlands
occupied
by
fierce
tattoo
covered
tribes
they
called
the
Picts
or
painted
people

From
the
carved
standing
stones
still
found
in
the
region
around
Loch
Ness
it
is
clear
the
Picts
were
fascinated
by
animals
and
careful
to
render
them
with
great
fidelity

All
the
animals
depicted
on
the
Pictish
stones
are
lifelike
and
easily
recognizable
all
but
one

The
exception
is
a
strange
beast
with
an
elongated
beak
or
muzzle
a
head
locket
or
spout
and
flippers
instead
of
feet

Described
by
some
scholars
as
a
swimming
elephant
the
Pictish
beast
is
the
earliest
known
evidence
for
an
idea
that
has
held
sway
in
the
Scottish
Highlands
for
at
least
years
that
Loch
Ness
is
home
to
a
mysterious
aquatic
animal

In
Scottish
folklore
large
animals
have
been
associated
with
many
bodies
of
water
from
small
streams
to
the
largest
lakes
often
labeled
Loch
na
Beistie
on
old
maps

These
water
horses
or
water
kelpies
are
said
to
have
magical
powers
and
malevolent
intentions

According
to
one
version
of
the
legend
the
water
horse
lures
small
children
into
the
water
by
offering
them
rides
on
its
back

Once
the
children
are
aboard
their
hands
become
stuck
to
the
beast
and
they
are
dragged
to
a
watery
death
their
livers
washing
ashore
the
following
day

The
earliest
written
reference
linking
such
creatures
to
Loch
Ness
is
in
the
biography
of
Saint
Columba
the
man
credited
with
introducing
Christianity
to
Scotland

In
A
D

according
to
this
account
Columba
was
on
his
way
to
visit
a
Pictish
king
when
he
stopped
along
the
shore
of
Loch
Ness

Seeing
a
large
beast
about
to
attack
a
man
who
was
swimming
in
the
lake
Columba
raised
his
hand
invoking
the
name
of
God
and
commanding
the
monster
to
go
back
with
all
speed

The
beast
complied
and
the
swimmer
was
saved

The

for
more
than
years

When
Nicholas
Witchell
a
future
BBC
correspondent
researched
the
history
of
the
legend
for
his
book
The
Loch
Ness
Story
he
found
about
a
dozen
pre
th
century
references
to
large
animals
in
Loch
Ness
gradually
shifting
in
character
from
these
clearly
mythical
accounts
to
something
more
like
eyewitness
descriptions

a
th
century
sensation
The
modern
legend
of
Loch
Ness
dates
from
when
a
new
road
was
completed
along
the
shore
offering
the
first
clear
views
of
the
loch
from
the
northern
side

One
April
afternoon
a
local
couple
was
driving
home
along
this
road
when
they
spotted
an
enormous
animal
rolling
and
plunging
on
the
surface

Their
account
was
written
up
by
a
correspondent
for
the
Inverness
Courier
whose
editor
used
the
word
monster
to
describe
the
animal

The
Loch
Ness
Monster
has
been
a
media
phenomenon
ever
since

Public
interest
built
gradually
during
the
spring
of
then
picked
up
sharply
after
a
couple
reported
seeing
one
of
the
creatures
on
land
lumbering
across
the
shore
road

By
October
several
London
newspapers
had
sent
correspondents
to
Scotland
and
radio
programs
were
being
interrupted
to
bring
listeners
the
latest
news
from
the
loch

A
British
circus
offered
a
reward
of
for
the
capture
of
the
beast

Hundreds
of
boy
scouts
and
outdoorsmen
arrived
some
venturing
out
in
small
boats
others
setting
up
deck
chairs
and
waiting
expectantly
for
the
monster
to
appear

The
excitement
over
the
monster
reached
a
fever
pitch
in
December
when
the
London
Daily
Mail
hired
an
actor
film
director
and
big
game
hunter
named
Marmaduke
Wetherell
to
track
down
the
beast

After
only
a
few
days
at
the
loch
Wetherell
reported
finding
the
fresh
footprints
of
a
large
four
toed
animal

He
estimated
it
to
be
feet
long

With
great
fanfare
Wetherell
made
plaster
casts
of
the
footprints
and
just
before
Christmas
sent
them
off
to
the
Natural
History
Museum
in
London
for
analysis

While
the
world
waited
for
the
museum
zoologists
to
return
from
holiday
legions
of
monster
hunters
descended
on
Loch
Ness
filling
the
local
hotels

Inverness
was
floodlit
for
the
occasion
and
traffic
jammed
the
shoreline
roads
in
both
directions

Marmaduke
Wetherell
Big

ABC
News
The
bubble
burst
in
early
January
when
museum
zoologists
announced
that
the
footprints
were
those
of
a
hippopotamus

They
had
been
made
with
a
stuffed
hippo
foot
the
base
of
an
umbrella
stand
or
ashtray

It
wasn
t
clear
whether
Wetherell
was
the
perpetrator
of
the
hoax
or
its
gullible
victim

Either
way
the
incident
tainted
the
image
of
the
Loch
Ness
Monster
and
discouraged
serious
investigation
of
the
phenomenon

For
the
next
three
decades
most
scientists
scornfully
dismissed
reports
of
strange
animals
in
the
loch

Those
sightings
that
weren
t
outright
hoaxes
they
said
were
the
result
of
optical
illusions
caused
by
boat
wakes
wind
slicks
floating
logs
otters
ducks
or
swimming
deer

Saw
Something
They
Did
Nevertheless
eyewitnesses
continued
to
come
forward
with
accounts
of
their
sightings
more
than
of
them
according
to
Witchell
s
estimate

Most
of
the
witnesses
described
a
large
creature
with
one
or
more
humps
protruding
above
the
surface
like
the
hull
of
an
upturned
boat

Others
reported
seeing
a
long
neck
or
flippers

What
was
most
remarkable
however
was
that
many
of
the
eyewitnesses
were
sober
level
headed
people
lawyers
and
priests
scientists
and
school
teachers
policemen
and
fishermen
even
a
Nobel
Prize
winner

In
the
s
a
local
doctor
named
Constance
Whyte
began
collecting
these
eyewitness
accounts
along
with
sketches
of
what
the
people
had
seen
finally
publishing
them
in
as
a
book
entitled
More
Than
a
Legend

Noting
that
many
of
her
friends
had
been
subjected
to
ridicule
and
contempt
Whyte
said
her
goal
in
writing
the
book
was
the
vindication
of
many
people
of
integrity
who
had
reported
honestly
what
they
had
seen
in
Loch

loch
and
promptly
gave
up
his
career
as
an
aeronautical
engineer
to
devote
his
life
to
pursuing
the
monster

The
next
year
a
group
of
dedicated
amateurs
formed
the
Loch
Ness
Investigation
Bureau
keeping
a
constant
vigil
on
the
loch
from
an
observation
post
on
the
northern
shore

But
perhaps
the
most
important
effect
of
Whyte
s
book
was
to
turn
the
tide
of
public
opinion

Long
dismissed
as
fodder
for
silly
season
press
reports
Nessie
was
finally
considered
a
subject
worthy
of
serious
scientific
investigation

In
the
span
of
a
decade
beginning
in
four
separate
expeditions
were
launched
first
by
the
BBC
then
by
three
respected
British
universities
Oxford
Cambridge
and
the
University
of
Birmingham

Rather
than
scanning
the
surface
with
binoculars
and
cameras
as
the
amateur
investigators
had
these
expeditions
came
equipped
with
sonar
a
military
technology
that
used
sound
to
search
the
underwater
environment

Though
the
expeditions
found
nothing
conclusive
in
each
case
the
sonar
operators
detected
large
moving
underwater
objects
they
could
not
explain

To
learn
how
sonar
works

Experiment
with
Sonar

In
Operation
Deep
Scan
the
most
ambitious
sonar
survey
of
Loch
Ness
found
three
unexplained
underwater
targets

North
Scene
Video
high
tech
searches
The
use
of
technology
to
search
the
loch
reached
a
new
level
in
the
s
when
a
series
of
expeditions
was
sponsored
by
the
Boston
based
Academy
of
Applied
Science
whose
members
included
many
technically
skilled
people
with
ties
to
MIT

The
Academy
s
approach
was
to
set
a
trap
for
the
monster
by
combining
sonar
and
underwater
photography
for
the
first
time

Under
the
leadership
of
Robert
Rines
a
lawyer
trained
in
physics
the
team
pointed
a
sophisticated
form
of
sonar
called
side
scan
sonar
out
into
Loch
Ness
from
a
point
near
the
shore

Nearby
they
placed
an
underwater
camera
taking
pictures
every
seconds
as
a
strobe
light
illuminated
the
depths
with
a
bright
flash

The
system
paid
off
one
night
in


At
the
same
moment
the
sonar
was
registering
a
large
moving
object
the
underwater
camera
was
taking
pictures
of
an
object
that
looked
after
development
and
computer
enhancement
like
the
flippers
of
an
aquatic
creature

Rines
discovery
won
the
support
of
two
reputable
scientists
Harold
Doc
Edgerton
the
legendary
MIT
scientist
who
had
invented
side
scan
sonar
and
strobe
photography
and
Sir
Peter
Scott
one
of
Britain
s
most
respected
naturalists

With
Edgerton
and
Scott
behind
him
Rines
was
given
an
opportunity
to
present
his
evidence
at
a
hearing
at
the
House
of
Commons
in
London

Never
had
the
possibility
of
the
Loch
Ness
Monster
been
taken
so
seriously

Almost
immediately
however
critics
began
to
raise
questions
about
the
evidence

Could
the
suggestive
sonar
traces
be
the
result
of
human
error
Had
the
flipper
photos
been
altered
to
improve
their
appearance
Just
as
damaging
to
Rines
case
was
Peter
Scott
s
bold
pronouncement
about
the
identity
of
the
creature

Based
on
the
flipper
photos
and
the
eyewitness
sightings
Scott
concluded
that
Nessie
was
a
plesiosaur
an
ancient
reptile
that
was
thought
to
have
gone
extinct
along
with
the
dinosaurs
some
million
years
ago

The
idea
was
just
too
far
fetched
for
professional
zoologists
to
take
seriously

painting
of
plesiosaur
This
painting
by
Sir
Peter
Scott
a
respected
British
naturalist
helped
create
the
popular
image
of
Nessie
as
an
ancient
reptile
called
a
plesiosaur

Adrian
Shrine
Bob
Rines
Although
zoologists
have
yet
to
conduct
the
full
scale
investigation
Rines
hoped
to
trigger
the
loch
continues
to
yield
intriguing
sonar
hits

In
an
expedition
called
Operation
Deep
Scan
used
a
flotilla
of
sonar
equipped
boats
to
sweep
the
loch
with
a
curtain
of
sound
the
operation
yielded
three
underwater
targets
that
could
not
be
explained

In
the
early
s
the
BBC
s
Nicholas
Witchell
helped
organize
Project
Urquhart
the
first
extensive
study
of
the
loch
s
biology
and
geology

Although
they
weren
t
looking
for
monsters
the
expedition
s
sonar
operators
detected
a
large
moving
underwater
target
and
followed
it
for
several
minutes
before
losing
it

And
during
the
expedition
featured
in
NOVA
s
Loch
Ness
film
Rines
and
his
longtime
colleague
Charles
Wyckoff
detected
yet
another
puzzling
underwater
target

According
to
the
expedition
s
sonar
expert
marine
biologist
Arne
Carr
it
was
a
moving
target
appeared
to
be
biological
in
nature
and
was
about
feet
long
the
size
of
a
small
whale

Famous
Photo
Falsified
In
the
years
since
the
birth
of
the
modern
legend
dozens
of
people
have
come
forward
with
photographs
purporting
to
show
the
monster

Most
were
quickly
dismissed
as
either
outright
frauds
or
images
of
ordinary
objects
mistaken
for
monsters

But
one
photo
stood
above
the
rest

Taken
in
it
shows
what
appears
to
be
the
slender
neck
of
an
animal
rising
from
the
surface
of
the
water

From
the
moment
it
was
published
in
the
London
Daily
Mail
it
became
the
very
image
of
the
Loch
Ness
Monster
and
for
many
the
strongest
evidence
that
Nessie
actually
exists

The
surgeon
s
photo
published
in
became
the
very
image
of
the
Loch
Ness
Monster

Fortean
Pictures
Library
One
reason
the
photograph
had
such
an
impact
on
the
Loch
Ness
legend
was
that
it
came
from
such
a
credible
source

The
photo
was
sold
to
the
Daily
Mail
by
a
London
physician
named
R

Kenneth
Wilson
who
said
he
had
taken
the
picture
when
he
noticed
a
commotion
in
the
water
as
he
was
driving
up
from
London
to
photograph
birds
with
a
friend
near
Inverness

Few
believed
that
such
a
respected
doctor
could
be
party
to
a
deception

R

Kenneth
Wilson
The
credibility
of
the
surgeon
s
photo
hinged
on
its
source
a
respected
London
doctor
named
R

Kenneth
Wilson

Fortean
Pictures
Library
But
in
years
after
the
photo
was
first
published
newspapers
around
the
world
reported
the
claim
that
the
surgeon
s
photo
was
a
fake
part
of
an
elaborate
plot
to
dupe
the
Daily
Mail

The
man
behind
the
story
was
a
former
English
art
teacher
named
Alastair
Boyd
who
had
become
an
avid
student
of
Loch
Ness
lore
after
he
and
his
wife
had
had
their
own
sighting
of
a
large
animal
in
the
loch
in


Years
later
a
friend
of
Boyd
s
named
David
Martin
discovered
an
old
newspaper
clipping
in
which
Ian
Wetherell
the
son
of
Marmaduke
Wetherell
of
hippo
foot
fame
claimed
the
surgeon
s
photo
was
a
hoax

The
article
had
attracted
little
attention
when
it
was
published
in
but
two
details
caught
Boyd
s
eye

First
Wetherell
said
the
plot
had
involved
a
man
named
Maurice
Chambers
the
very
same
man
that
Dr

Wilson
said
he
had
driven
up
from
London
to
visit
in


Second
Wetherell
mentioned
that
the
surgeon
s
photograph
included
the
scenery
of
Loch
Ness
in
the
background

In
fact
the
familiar
Nessie
photo
includes
only
the
protruding
neck
and
the
water
around
it

Boyd
knew
that
the
original
photo
had
included
a
bit
of
the
far
shoreline
in
the
background
because
he
had
rediscovered
the
uncropped
version
in
the
late
s

But
that
full
photo
had
been
published
only
once
in


So
how
could
Wetherell
have
known
this
detail
Either
he
had
a
very
long
memory
or
he
took
the
picture
Boyd
says

surgeon
s
photo
uncropped
The
full
uncropped
surgeon
s
photo
published
only
once
in
was
rediscovered
by
Boyd
more
than
years
later

Fortean
Pictures
Library
Ian
Wetherell
had
died
by
the
time
Boyd
and
Martin
read
the
article
but
they
were
able
to
track
down
his
step
brother
Christian
Spurling
in
the
south
of
England

Spurling
and
near
death
confessed

Unhappy
with
the
way
he
was
treated
by
the
Daily
Mail
after
the
hippo
foot
fiasco
Duke
Wetherell
had
set
out
to
get
his
revenge
enlisting
his
son
and
step
son
in
the
plot

First
Spurling
built
a
model
monster
by
grafting
a
head
and
neck
onto
the
conning
tower
of
a
toy
submarine

Then
Wetherell
and
his
son
Ian
drove
up
to
the
loch
and
staged
the
photograph
taking
care
to
include
the
actual
Loch
Ness
scenery
in
the
background

Finally
to
conceal
his
own
role
in
the
hoax
Wetherell
persuaded
Dr

Wilson
through
their
common
friend
Chambers
to
have
the
photo
developed
and
sell
it
to
the
Daily
Mail
as
his
own

The
plot
worked
better
than
any
of
them
could
have
imagined

Not
everyone
accepts
the
Spurling
story

American
journalist
Richard
Smith
for
example
notes
that
toy
experts
question
whether
the
toy
submarines
of
the
s
could
have
performed
as
described
and
he
wonders
why
Boyd
waited
until
after
Spurling
s
death
to
reveal
his
confession

But
in
the
aftermath
of
Boyd
s
bombshell
most
people
now
believe
the
surgeon
s
photo
was
yet
another
Loch
Ness
hoax

The
year
old
stepson
of
Marmaduke
Wetherell
told
Boyd
he
made
the
monster
in
the
picture
by
grafting
a
plastic
wood
neck
to
a
toy
submarine

WGBH
Educational
Foundation
Does
that
finally
disprove
the
monster
s
existence
Not
at
all
says
Boyd

One
of
the
great
ironies
of
the
Loch
Ness
story
is
that
the
man
who
brought
down
the
most
famous
piece
of
evidence
remains
a
firm
believer
in
Nessie

I
am
so
convinced
of
the
reality
of
these
creatures
that
I
would
actually
stake
my
life
on
their
existence
he
told
NOVA

I
trust
my
eyesight




I
used
to
make
my
living
teaching
people
how
to
observe
and
I
know
that
the
thing
I
saw
was
not
a
log
or
an
otter
or
a
wave
or
anything
like
that

It
was
a
large
animal

It
came
heaving
out
of
the
water
something
like
a
whale

I
mean
the
part
that
was
actually
on
the
surface
when
it
stopped
rolling
through
was
at
least
feet
long

It
was
totally
extraordinary

It
s
the
most
amazing
thing
I
ve
ever
seen
in
my
life
and
if
I
could
afford
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
looking
for
another
glimpse
of
it
I
would

The
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollow
Washington
Irving
Historic
Hudson
Valley
Presents
Beloved
by
generations
of
readers
Washington
Irving
s
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollow
ranks
among
the
classics
of
American
literature

Although
it
is
one
of
Irving
s
shortest
works
it
has
had
a
long
life
since
it
first
was
published
in


For
nearly
years
the
story
has
captured
the
imagination
of
both
children
and
adults

The
characters
setting
and
events
come
alive
through
Irving
s
descriptions
and
artists
of
all
types
have
used
the
story
for
source
material

From
shortly
after
the
story
s
first
publication
until
today
the
story
has
inspired
creative
works
illustrations
paintings
sculpture
music
films
television
shows
even
advertising

The
Story
Legend
possesses
elements
of
a
thriller
but
at
the
heart
of
the
tale
is
a
love
triangle
set
in
Sleepy
Hollow
on
the
shore
of
the
Hudson
River
at
the
turn
of
the
th
century

Ichabod
Crane
an
itinerant
schoolteacher
falls
for
Katrina
Van
Tassel
the
pretty
daughter
of
a
prosperous
local
family

Ichabod
s
gangling
appearance
and
odd
habits
as
well
as
his
obvious
attraction
to
Katrina
make
him
an
easy
target
for
Katrina
s
other
suitor
Brom
Bones
the
swaggering
village
blade
in
Irving
s
description

Tension
builds
between
Brom
and
Ichabod
until
one
dark
autumn
night
when
Ichabod
riding
along
a
lonely
wooded
road
finds
himself
with
a
ghostly
headless
companion

Overwhelmed
by
fear
and
all
the
spooky
tales
he
has
heard
Ichabod
flees
hoping
to
reach
the
security
of
the
nearby
bridge
and
churchyard

The
horseman
gives
chase
and
just
as
Ichabod
reaches
safety
the
horseman
throws
what
appears
to
be
his
head
at
the
schoolteacher

The
next
day
Ichabod
cannot
be
found
but
the
villagers
discover
his
horse
and
the
remains
of
a
pumpkin
leaving
the
reader
to
speculate
as
to
what
happened

Was
Ichabod
s
encounter
with
a
true
ghost
Or
was
he
the
victim
of
a
cruel
prank
Irving
s
inspirations
Irving
wrote
Legend
while
living
in
England

Some
scholars
suggest
Irving
s
tale
may
have
been
inspired
by
folk
stories
he
heard
during
his
time
abroad

German
English
and
Scandinavian
folktales
involving
a
headless
rider
chasing
hapless
travelers
have
been
told
for
many
generations

Irving
may
have
heard
or
read
versions
of
these
tales
and
reimagined
his
own
iteration
in
the
Hudson
River
Valley
setting
he
knew
so
well

The
author
incorporated
many
local
names
and
details
adding
an
air
of
authenticity
to
his
telling

He
also
claimed
that
the
original
text
was
found
among
the
papers
of
the
late
Diedrich
Knickerbocker
who
in
turn
heard
the
tale
recounted
by
a
pleasant
shabby
gentlemanly
old
fellow
some
years
earlier

These
layers
of
authorship
remind
readers
of
the
essential
nature
of
a
legend
a
story
told
and
retold
by
tradition
and
no
longer
verifiable

Critical
Success
Legend
formed
part
of
The
Sketch
Book
of
Geoffrey
Crayon
a
set
of
stories
written
by
Irving
and
published
in
installments
in
and


Very
quickly
readers
latched
on
to
Irving
s
work

Good
reviews
from
Irving
s
influential
literary
friends
helped
but
critics
outside
his
circle
raved
too

English
critics
were
favorably
impressed
that
an
American
author
could
write
so
well
and
Irving
delighted
in
having
upended
English
literary
prejudices

Multiple
reprints
and
editions
followed
in
England
and
in
the
United
States
as
well
as
foreign
language
translations

The
early
literary
success
of
The
Sketch
Book
helped
Irving
to
build
his
career
as
a
writer
and
eventually
enabled
him
to
purchase
Sunnyside
make
improvements
to
the
property
and
help
his
family
members
financially

Legend
has
never
been
out
of
print
since
it
first
was
published

Irving
wrote
many
other
works
but
arguably
Legend
remains
the
most
popular
perhaps
because
fans
of
the
story
love
to
be
a
bit
frightened
imagining
themselves
in
Ichabod
s
saddle
fleeing
for
their
lives
from
a
headless
phantom

A
Part
of
Popular
Culture
Irving
makes
no
mention
of
Halloween
in
his
tale
rather
he
set
the
climax
in
the
evening
of
a
fine
autumnal
day

The
ghostly
and
frightening
elements
of
the
tale
however
mean
it
is
now
closely
associated
with
the
holiday

The
link
is
strengthened
by
artists
who
have
shown
the
horseman
carrying
a
scary
jack
o
lantern
as
a
head
embellishing
what
Irving
only
suggests
that
the
horseman
s
head
was
actually
a
pumpkin

Thanks
to
the
wide
readership
of
Irving
s
story
now
combined
with
the
number
of
people
who
know
one
of
the
many
children
s
editions
comic
books
animated
cartoons
films
or
television
shows
inspired
by
the
tale
the
characters
are
well
known
and
easily
identified

They
have
been
appropriated
and
reimagined
and
as
a
result
have
become
even
further
embedded
in
American
popular
culture

Through
new
vehicles
and
representations
Irving
s
tale
keeps
audiences
amused
captivated
and
terrified
after
nearly
two
centuries

Why

Arthurian
Legends
So

Source
It
is
wholly
possible
that
you
have
come
across
an
adaptation
of
Arthurian
legend
at
some
point
in
your
life

After
all
there
have
been
so
many
interpretations
across
varying
genres
and
media
that
an
entire
Wikipedia
page
has
been
dedicated
to
listing
them
all

One
of
the
most
well
known
works
includes
Sir
Thomas
Malory
s
Le
Morte
d
Arthur

It
has
been
deemed
the
most
extensive
and
culturally
important
work
based
on
Arthurian
legends

This
is
because
it
goes
in
depth
into
the
histories
of
many
characters
notably
the
more
prominent
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
and
Arthur
himself

Le
Morte
d
Arthur
has
inspired
other
great
works
such
as
T
H

White
s
The
Once
and
Future
King

Arthurian
legends
have
also
been
often
referenced
in
parodies
such
as
Monty
Python
and
the
third
Shrek
movie

With
all
these
different
retellings
of
Arthurian
legend
it
becomes
clear
that
they
are
widely
celebrated
even
within
pop
culture

That
leads
us
to
the
question
why
are
Arthurian
legends
so
popular
in
the
first
place
The
general
storyline
of
Arthurian
legends
goes
something
like
this
Arthur
guided
by
the
eccentric
wizard
Merlin
obtains
the
legendary
sword
Excalibur
and
becomes
King
of
Camelot

In
some
versions
he
acquires
the
sword
from
the
Lady
of
the
Lake

In
others
he
retrieves
the
sword
from
its
immovable
place
in
stone

He
then
held
court
in
Camelot
and
was
aided
by
the
many
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
his
rule
peaceful
and
prosperous

Eventually
King
Arthur
and
the
Knights
set
off
on
a
quest
to
find
the
immortality
granting
Holy
Grail

While
they
are
away
Lancelot
one
of
the
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
engages
in
adultery
with
Queen
Guinevere

An
enraged
King
Arthur
starts
a
civil
war
upon
receiving
word
of
the
affair

However
King
Arthur
s
rule
was
ultimately
brought
to
an
end
when
he
was
betrayed
by
the
Camelot
s
regent
Mordred
who
sought
to
seize
the
throne
for
himself

The
resulting
battle
ended
with
both
King
Arthur
and
Mordred
meeting
their
demise

After
his
death
King
Arthur
was
sent
on
a
boat
to
Avalon
where
he
is
presumed
to
remain
until
today

It
is
said
that
someday
when
Great
Britain
is
in
dire
need
King
Arthur
will
return
to
save
his
people

It
is
likely
that
Arthurian
legends
are
popular
due
to
its
character
archetypes
and
storytelling

Arthurian
legends
feature
characters
that
possess
distinct
personalities
or
capabilities
yet
still
leave
a
lot
of
room
open
for
interpretation

This
is
especially
the
case
for
characters
who
are
fan
favourites
including
Merlin
Morgan
le
Fay
and
Lancelot

There
are
retellings
centred
around
these
specific
characters

For
instance
BBC
s
Merlin
series
and
French
drama
Lancelot
du
Lac

Many
characters
in
Arthurian
legends
represent
beloved
archetypes
commonly
found
in
literature

As
an
example
King
Arthur
expectedly
falls
under
the
Hero
archetype

This
is
evident
through
his
tremendous
courage
and
dignity
making
him
the
perfect
example
of
chivalry

He
is
able
to
triumph
in
multiple
challenges
throughout
his
life
and
manages
to
ensure
peace
while
he
remains
King

Archetypes
can
also
be
easily
assigned
to
other
characters
in
Arthurian
legend

An
example
would
be
Merlin
who
falls
under
the
Mentor
archetype

Equipped
with
knowledge
and
magical
abilities
Merlin
acted
as
an
advisor
to
Arthur
as
he
was
growing
up
hence
becoming
a
great
influence
to
Arthur

The
Hero
and
Mentor
archetypes
as
well
as
styles
of
character
have
been
replicated
in
famous
works
for
example
Aragorn
and
Gandalf
respectively
from
J
R
R

Tolkien
s
Lord
of
the
Rings
trilogy

Character
tropes
are
still
commonly
used
in
the
realms
of
fiction
and
literature

They
are
viewed
as
incredibly
important
as
they
are
able
to
depict
particular
aspects
of
human
nature
and
life
thus
constructing
a
sense
of
familiarity
for
readers
or
the
audiences
of
a
variety
of
media

Another
reason
attributing
to
the
perseverance
of
archetypes
include
linking
the
current
text
to
established
identities
in
other
past
works
therefore
adding
supplementary
meaning
to
the
text

Consequently
it
is
not
exceptional
to
discover
that
numerous
characters
and
plots
resemble
or
overlap
with
that
of
Arthurian
legends
which
have
served
as
models
or
inspiration
for
later
works

Furthermore
Arthurian
legends
may
be
well
received
due
to
the
mystery
involved

There
is
no
definite
storyline
as
Arthurian
legends
are
pieced
together
from
a
number
of
different
sources

There
is
no
confirmation
on
which
version
is
the
original
adding
to
the
intrigue
revolving
around
the
tales

Arthur
s
birth
and
life
have
even
become
a
point
of
research
for
historians
while
some
scholars
claim
that
he
is
a
Celtic
deity
others
assume
that
he
was
a
real
person
of
Romano
Briton
origins

However
it
is
not
only
Arthur
that
is
subjected
to
such
ambiguity

The
characters
and
settings
surrounding
him
also
vary
in
terms
of
their
history
and
moral
alignment

Take
Morgan
le
Fay
for
example

She
is
portrayed
as
an
evil
sorceress
in
some
versions
but
is
shown
as
a
benevolent
healer
who
laid
Arthur
to
rest
at
Avalon

As
Arthurian
legends
are
known
to
end
on
a
cliffhanger
hence
Arthur
is
known
as
the
Once
and
Future
King
it
is
generally
agreed
upon
that
the
period
of
time
in
which
he
presumably
ruled
the
Golden
Age
has
passed
while
the
true
question
of
when
will
he
be
back
is
left
unanswered

The
obscurity
of
the
source
material
gives
artists
and
creators
the
freedom
to
come
up
with
their
own
versions
of
the
characters
and
the
story
based
on
their
own
takes
and
perspectives

The
temptations
of
filling
in
plot
holes
or
exploring
different
parts
of
Arthurian
legends
may
prove
to
be
too
alluring
to
withstand
for
storytellers

Apart
from
fiction
it
is
perhaps
because
we
know
so
much
yet
so
little
of
Arthurian
legends
that
academic
research
on
the
very
subject
is
still
carried
out
today

As
curator
Dr
ap
Huw
mentions
the
appeal
of
Arthur
is
that
he
was
or
is
whoever
you
want
him
to
be


Source
Sure
Arthurian
legends
may
be
popular
but
at
the
possible
expense
of
angering
Arthurian
scholars
and
fans
are
the
legends
actually
important
The
answer
to
this
is
subjective
and
depends
on
the
audience
s
opinions

Still
it
cannot
be
denied
that
the
legends
are
classics
that
illustrate
an
important
piece
of
history
no
matter
Arthur
s
status
as
real
or
fiction

Like
fairytales
they
are
a
snapshot
of
how
and
what
people
s
beliefs
were
like
at
the
time

Arthurian
legends
have
also
been
proved
to
withstand
the
test
of
time
from
mediaeval
to
the
modern
era

As
mentioned
they
have
been
revamped
a
great
number
of
times
in
the
form
of
official
published
works
to
writings
across
fanfiction
sites
although
essentially
all
Arthur
retellings
are
fanfiction
of
sorts

It
has
become
a
cultural
work
of
considerable
significance
and
its
enduring
popularity
demonstrates
that
the
legends
are
still
fully
capable
of
attracting
a
sizable
audience
old
young
and
anywhere
in
between

The
many
adaptations
of
Arthurian
legends
in
the
fantasy
genre
like
C
S

Lewis
The
Chronicles
of
Narnia
and
even
George
Lucas
Star
Wars
undoubtedly
attest
to
the
legends
influence

Not
only
have
they
been
featured
heavily
in
fiction
and
academia
aspects
of
it
namely
Excalibur
and
mediaeval
armour
have
also
made
circles
in
the
fashion
world
as
seen
in
the
form
of
Italian
designer
Alberta
Ferretti
s
limited
edition
collection
inspired
by
King
Arthur

There
are
also
those
who
have
dedicated
their
time
and
effort
to
uncovering
the
real
life
counterparts
of
the
settings
in
which
Arthurian
legends
take
place

In
particular
it
has
been
widely
hypothesised
that
Avalon
could
in
actuality
be
Glastonbury
or
Isle
of
Man
though
the
lack
of
substantial
evidence
points
Avalon
to
be
a
myth
derived
from
early
Celtic
tales

The
story
of
King
Arthur
dives
into
romance
and
chivalry

Historian
Michael
Woods
suggests
that
King
Arthur
s
times
was
a
golden
age
of
lost
innocence
hence
forging
a
strong
connection
with
people
who
long
for
a
sense
of
dignity
and
justice
that
seem
to
only
exist
in
myth

The
diverse
interpretations
of
Arthurian
legends
also
bring
to
light
different
aspects
of
the
tale
such
as
the
contrasting
portrayals
of
Morgan
le
Fay
and
how
it
possesses
links
to
misogyny
and
the
storyteller
s
perspectives

What
do
you
think
of
when
it
comes
to
Arthurian
legends
Is
it
the
memorable
characters
the
beautiful
settings
or
the
weighty
symbolism
Do
you
have
any
theories
of
when
King
Arthur
will
rise
again
Arthurian
legends
can
mean
many
things
to
many
different
people

They
evolve
according
to
its
audience
and
their
expectations
as
well
as
understanding
of
the
stories

Even
so
it
is
evident
that
Arthurian
legends
remain
compelling
in
the
minds
of
the
people

As
the
BBC
reports
Romantics
may
hope
that
one
day
Arthur
will
return
to
rescue
his
people

But
if
he
lives
on
through
his
legend
the
ancient
monarch
it
would
appear
has
never
really
gone
away

An
Overview
of
Master

Ladies
and
gentlemen
By
the

airways
would
like
you
to
buckle
your
safety
belts
and
make
sure
your
seats
are
in
an
upright
locked
position
as
we
descend
into

MASTER
LEGEND
The
article
The
Legend
of
Master
Legend
written
by
Joshuah
Bearman
and
appearing
in
the
January
edition
of
Rolling
Stone
was
my
and
many
other
people
s
introduction
to
the
concept
of
real
life
superheroes

Reading
about
that
fascinating
idea
led
me
to
seeking
out
my
local
RLSH
the
Watchman
and
talking
with
him
led
me
to
forming
the
idea
that
I
would
like
to
write
a
book
on
this
subject

After
setting
up
a
MySpace
page
for
the
book
I
shortly
received
two
very
different
e
mails

One
was
from
someone
telling
me
what
a
great
awesome
guy
Master
Legend
was
and
that
I
should
get
in
contact
with
him

A
second
e
mail
told
me
that
Master
Legend
was
a
nutjob
and
they
were
sick
of
writers
using
him
as
a
representative
of
the
RLSH
community

And
so
it
has
gone
ever
since

I
have
seen
a
large
amount
of
debate
online
and
heard
many
people
s
opinions
on
the
phone
and
in
person

Because
of
this
amount
of
controversy
I
have
put
off
writing
about
the
man
here
on
my
blog
but
I
feel
the
time
is
now
to
have
a
thorough
discussion
about
him

My
goal
is
to
provide
as
fair
of
a
representative
of
views
supporting
or
criticizing
him

In
this
first
part
I
will
be
presenting
an
overview
of
pro
and
anti
statements
I
have
seen
repeatedly
during
my
course
of
writing
about
RLSH

PRO
LEGEND
Tales
of
Comic
Book
Bravado
and
Crimefighting
Something
that
appeals
to
some
RLSH
about
Master
Legend
is
that
he
is
very
dynamic
and
energetic

He
is
often
documented
running
jumping
and
doing
things
like
hitting
the
wall
of
his
garage
with
a
giant
metal
fist

He
makes
comic
book
exclamations
like
By
the
Gods
He
threatens
to
give
evil
doers
an
all
night
tour
of
Fist
City
His
stories
are
wild
action
packed
and
never
a
snoozefest

Some
of
them
are
fantastic
and
we
must
take
them
at
Master
Legend
s
word
since
the
only
witnesses
are
Master
Legend
himself
and
the
claimed
league
of
frightened
criminals
who
have
had
the
misfortune
of
crossing
paths
with
him

Here
s
a
recent
blog
post
There
has
been
an
evil
doer
in
my
town
and
you
know
I
won
t
allow
it

This
guy
known
as
Big
Red
has
been
terrorizing
my
homeless
friends
but
now
it
s
time
to
meet
the
Legend

This
guy
has
tried
to
evade
me
because
he
knows
of
the
whispered
tales
behind
shuttered
doors
of
Master
Legend

He
has
a
few
punks
that
do
crack
friends
so
I
got
Brimstone
to
come
along
for
mission
attack

I
knew
where
he
would
be
and
right
on
time

He
has
been
running
his
mouth
out
in
the
streets
saying
he
can
kick
Master
Legend
s
ass

I
tell
you
this
he
will
need
more
Cheerios
then
the
universe
has

So
yesterday
fellow
Team
Justice
member
Brimstone
and
I
made
a
quick
approach
in
the
Justice
Van

We
caught
him
hassling
my
friends
red
handed
so
I
told
him
so
you
want
to
kick
my
ass
here
s
your
chance
I
threw
off
my
shirt
and
slipped
on
my
fighting
gloves
and
said
alright
boy
you
can
run
your
mouth
but
can
you
run
your
fist
Sorry
to
say
the
big
lug
ran
for
it

He
got
on
his
bike
and
zoomed
away
faster
than
I
ever
saw
him
go
before
ha
ha
ha

It
just
goes
to
show
you
my
friends
that
the
bully
is
really
a
sissy
inside

It
is
up
to
us
all
to
stand
against
evil
and
destroy
it

I
know
if
we
all
work
together
we
can

Master
Legend
Wards
Off
Dangerous
Criminal
June
MySpace
blog
It
s
a
good
story
I
see
why
people
would
like
it

An
evildoer
is
threatening
the
homeless
Master
Legend
shows
up
and
scares
him
off
then
parts
with
some
good
advice

If
Big
Red
was
hassling
my
homeless
friends
I
d
load
up
the
Justice
Van
with
Brimstone
and
go
threaten
to
kick
his
ass
too

Big
Red
if
you
re
reading
this
Fist
City

Master
Legend
s
energy
and
his
war
stories
are
contagious
and
has
won
him
RLSH
and
non
RLSH
fans
alike

Work
with
Team
Justice
Something
that
has
been
well
documented
are
the
things
he
does
with
Team
Justice
which
made
RLSH
history
by
becoming
the
first
RLSH
non
profit
group

Along
with
his
fellow
team
members
Superhero
Lady
Hero
Symbiote
Ace
Diamond
Brimstone
and
others
he
has
delivered
food
and
supplies
to
Florida
s
large
homeless
population

He
very
sensibly
has
handed
out
socks
to
the
homeless

That
may
seem
like
a
very
minor
thing
but
if
you
are
homeless
in
a
climate
like
Florida
s
clean
socks
aren
t
just
a
matter
of
being
more
comfortable
they
can
literally
be
a
life
saver
preventing
fatal
disease

He
has
participated
in
Christmas
time
toy
drives
charity
events
and
helped
distribute
flyers
of
missing
children

These
missions
are
well
documented
with
photos
and
video
which
you
can
see
at

Acting
as
a
Media
Ambassador
Besides
the
Rolling
Stone
article
mentioned
Master
Legend
has
attracted
media
attention
from
around
the
world
and
for
many
documentarians
flying
to
Florida
is
at
the
top
of
the
list

I
know
for
a
fact
he
has
been
visited
by
two
documentary
film
makers
in
the
last
two
months
and
receives
a
steady
stream
of
visiting
journalists
authors
documentary
film
makers
and
photographers

I
have
heard
rumors
that
he
has
had
interest
from
HBO
about
developing
a
show
of
some
kind
and
strangely
has
even
had
talks
about
his
own
cooking
show
Some
RLSH
say
this
media
attention
is
not
just
good
for
Master
Legend
but
good
for
RLSH
in
general

Not
only
that
but
Master
Legend
runs
his
own
RLSH
forum
leading
a
platoon
at
the
Master
Legend
Army
and
recently
began
his
own
internet
radio
entry
The
Master
Legend
Show

Can
Shred
on
Guitar
One
of
America
s
great
exports
besides
comic
book
superheroes
is
rock
n
roll
and
Master
Legend
likes
to
shred
on
the
guitar
as
evidenced
by
video
showing
him
performing
with
the
band
Alias
Punch
as
well
as
his
own
musical
projects

Master
Legend
tells
me
his
favorite
guitar
players
are
Randy
California
Spirit
also
played
with
Jimmy
Hendrix
Eric
Lifeson
Rush
and
Jeff
Beck
The
Yardbirds


It
stands
to
follow
that
Americans
like
superheroes
and
they
like
rock
n
roll
so
a
rock
n
roll
superhero
who
fights
crime
and
can
do
a
guitar
solo
is
going
to
impress
a
certain
amount
of
people

Recognition
From
Local
Law
Enforcement
In
The
Legend
of
Master
Legend
Joshuah
Bearman
reports
that
he
got
in
touch
with
a
local
police
Sergeant
who
spoke
favorably
of
Master
Legend

The
Sergeant
who
s
in
charge
of
vice
investigations
took
a
chance
and
tracked
Master
Legend
down

Based
on
the
neighborhood
he
figured
Master
Legend
might
be
a
good
local
contact

And
sure
enough
the
Sergeant
tells
me
I
start
getting
calls
from
Master
Legend
with
information

And
it
checks
out

Master
Legend
has
helped
put
away
a
few
criminals

Additionally
a
photo
on
MySpace
shows
Master
Legend
receiving
a
certificate
of
recognition
from
a
police
officer

ALSO
ADDED
RLSHs
tell
me
that
Master
Legend
helped
Florida
residents
in
the
aftermath
of
Hurricane
Charly
He
helped
cut
apart
trees
on
roads
so
relief
trucks
and
traffic
can
get
through

He
was
also
pulling
people
out
of
their
houses
who
were
trapped

ANTI
LEGEND
Tales
of
Comic
Book
Bravado
and
Crimefighting
The
very
thing
that
appeals
to
some
people
about
Master
Legend
is
what
others
use
as
a
criticism
his
storytelling

Many
of
his
claims
have
no
documentation
and
are
outlandish

For
example
in
his
article
Joshuah
Bearman
writes
about
how
Master
legend
and
Justice
Force
a
pre
Team
Justice
had
a
mission
to
put
the
stomp
on
a
child
molester
and
his
gang
of
crackheads

Master
Legend
has
many
more
florid
tales
of
adventure
some
plausible
like
retrieving
a
friend
s
stolen
money
others
quite
outlandish
like
the
child
molester
and
his
gang
of
crackheads

For
starters
doesn
t
it
seem
like
you
d
have
to
be
one
charismatic
child
molester
to
attract
an
entire
gang
of
crackheads
to
do
your
bidding
The
Legend
of
Master
Legend
by
Joshuah
Bearman
Rolling
Stone
Jan

In
another
blog
entry
Master
Legend
himself
describes
a
confrontation
he
has
in
an
alleyway
with
three
criminals
he
encounters
while
give
a
homeless
man
blankets

After
engaging
them
in
combat
he
writes
about
how
he
wins
the
back
alley
brawl
I
then
see
the
first
guy
back
at
me
so
I
throw
a
drop
kick
on
him

I
then
take
off
my
helmet
and
bash
him
in
the
head
with
it
by
this
time
they
hear
the
Legend
yell
as
I
go
into
Fist
City
mode

The
one
guy
s
head
is
bleeding
and
he
staggers
off
as
the
other
two
are
back
on
me

I
still
use
my
helmet
as
my
weapon

Then
one
whips
out
a
knife
so
I
quickly
reach
into
my
utility
belt
and
grab
a
habanero
pepper

I
quickly
chew
it
up
while
backing
off
then
I
snap
kick
the
first
one
that
charged

The
guy
with
the
knife
slashes
at
me
and
I
spit
the
pepper
in
his
eyes

He
hits
the
ground
screaming
I
turn
around
and
laid
out
about
punches
on
the
other
guy

Then
ran
back
over
to
the
guy
with
the
knife
and
stomped
it
out
his
hand
and
even
sprained
my
foot
kicking
him
into
the
brick
wall

Fist
City
in
the
Scummy
Alleyway
Jan

MySpace
blog
He
goes
on
to
say
that
he
flees
the
scene
when
someone
comes
across
it
and
says
they
are
calling
the
cops

Master
Legend
says
call
them
and
gives
the
person
his
card
before
heading
to
a
pizza
joint
and
ordering
pizza
and
beer

The
police
show
up
there
and
basically
tell
him
to
keep
up
the
good
work

So
Master
Legend
triumphs
over
three
armed
street
hoods
using
his
WWII
helmet
and
habanero
pepper
he
has
tucked
in
his
utility
belt

Do
I
have
evidence
this
story
is
false
No
I
don
t

But
I
will
say
if
I
tried
to
file
this
story
as
factual
I
can
tell
you
my
editors
most
likely
would


Check
the
calendar
to
see
if
it
was
April



Tell
me
to
get
out
of
their
office
possibly
permanently

Claims
of
Metaphysical
and
Religious
Powers
Master
Legend
has
claimed
to
have
various
metaphysical
and
voodoo
based
powers

From
the
about
me
section
of
his
MySpace
I
am
a
real
life
super
hero
born
with
a
purple
veil
and
certain
psychic
abilities
and
gifted
with
powers
by
a
voodoo
queen

I
am
here
to
help
you
and
will
put
my
life
on
the
line
to
do
so

Never
hesitate
to
ask
for
my
advice
or
for
me
to
use
my
powers
to
help
you

MySpace
In
January
Master
Legend
posted
a
message
that
he
was
the
archangel
Metatron

It
first
appeared
at
the
Heroes
Network
which
led
to
him
being
banned
from
that
forum

Here
is
the
post
in
question
I
the
arch
angel
Metatron
am
taking
prayer
requests

Do
not
be
afraid
and
let
me
cast
away
demons
and
ailments
in
your
life

God
has
told
me
I
can
do
this
at
this
time
so
come
to
me
with
your
troubles
and
I
will
help
and
it
doesn
t
matter
who
you
are

January
Anti
Homosexual
Comments
Master
Legend
has
received
some
controversy
from
statements
he
s
made
regarding
homosexuals

For
instance
on
March
Atavistik
a
RLSH
from
Northern
California
posted
a
thread
titled
RLSHSF
Meet
at
Pride
Festival
at
therlsh
net

He
suggested
that
RLSHs
in
Northern
California
meet
up
for
San
Francisco
s
Gay
Pride
Fest

Master
Legend
responded
to
the
thread
Do
you
not
see
this
is
like
a
gateway
drug
to
even
worst
sic
immorality
I
tell
you
this
because
I
care
and
I
can
rest
easy
knowing
I
tried
to
warn
you

I
don
t
care
if
people
want
to
hate
me
for
being
a
man
of
the
bible
but
the
bible
is
not
all
my
reason

Can
you
not
see
the
sickness
that
leads
to
death
This
is
just
horrible

You
want
to
praise
disgust
and
evil
and
call
it
freedom
What
s
next
child
molester
pride
day
Hey
it
s
freedom
so
that
gives
me
the
freedom
to
say
the
truth

I
don
t
feel
sorry
for
them
or
praise
this

I
also
have
the
freedom
to
destroy
this
evil

I
cannot
believe
that
this
is
not
seen

March
Allegations
of
Alcohol
Abuse
By
this
I
m
not
talking
about
the
fact
the
Master
Legend
drinks
in
the
comfort
of
Legend
Tower

Many
people
of
all
professions
drink
police
officers
doctors
ditch
diggers
even
RLSH
bloggers

The
allegations
I
am
talking
about
are
Master
Legend
drinking
and
then
going
on
patrol
or
driving
the
Justice
Van

I
want
to
be
very
clear
I
have
no
evidence
that
will
back
such
an
allegation
up
and
will
give
full
benefit
of
the
doubt
that
these
allegations
are
false
until
I
see
proof
otherwise

The
reason
it
has
made
this
list
is
that
I
have
heard
these
allegations
not
once
but
several
times

WELCOME
TO
HEROES
IN
THE
NIGHT
My
name
is
Tea
Krulos
and
I
m
a
freelance
writer
from
Milwaukee
Wisconsin

I
was
introduced
to
the
Real
Life
Super
Hero
RLSH
story
in
late
February


As
a
lifelong
fan
of
comic
books
and
unusual
and
unique
people
and
subcultures
I
was
immediately
hooked

I
was
determined
to
find
a
local
RLSH
if
there
was
one
and
found
The
Watchman
a
man
who
dons
a
red
rubber
mask
suit
and
trenchcoat
and
patrols
the
streets
of
Milwaukee

I
had
a
long
fascinating
interview
with
him
in
person
one
night
and
determined
that
the
short
magazine
piece
I
had
successfully
pitched
did
not
scratch
the
surface
of
the
story
and
decided
to
write
a
book

After
a
few
months
I
also
established
this
blog
both
the
book
and
the
blog
are
titled
Heroes
in
the
Night

My
book
is
based
on
extensive
research
interviewing
and
field
work

I
have
traveled
to
meet
RLSH
in
Minneapolis
Rochester
Minnesota
Brooklyn
Vancouver
Portland
Seattle
San
Diego
New
Bedford
Massachusetts
and
Washington
DC
as
well
as
meeting
regularly
with
the
Milwaukee
crew

I
have
been
quoted
as
an
expert
on
the
subject
in
the
New
York
Times
Wall
Street
Journal
People
magazine
Seattle
Weekly
Scientific
American
io

com
Milwaukee
Journal
Sentinel
and
dozens
of
other
newspapers
magazines
websites
around
the
world

I
ve
also
made
appearances
on
a
dozen
radio
shows
and
have
been
filmed
for
three
different
RLSH
documentaries

I
have
written
articles
on
the
subject
for
Milwaukee
magazine
the
Boston
Phoenix
New
York

The

and
Fall
of

Twins

The
film

career
and

Plot
edit
In
the
s
Reggie
Kray
is
a
former
boxer
who
has
become
an
important
part
of
the
criminal
underground
in
London

At
the
start
of
the
film
his
twin
brother
Ron
is
locked
up
in
a
psychiatric
hospital
for
paranoid
schizophrenia

Reggie
uses
threats
to
obtain
the
premature
release
of
his
brother

The
twins
unite
their
efforts
to
control
a
large
part
of
London
s
criminal
underworld
made
easier
when
the
head
of
the
south
London
Richardson
Gang
a
k
a

the
Torture
Gang
is
imprisoned

One
of
their
first
efforts
is
to
muscle
in
on
the
control
of
a
local
nightclub
using
extortion
and
brutal
violence

Reg
enters
into
a
relationship
with
Frances
his
driver
s
sister
whom
he
eventually
marries

When
he
is
imprisoned
for
a
previous
criminal
conviction
which
he
cannot
evade
she
makes
him
swear
that
he
will
leave
his
criminal
life
behind
an
oath
he
never
honours
owing
to
the
allure
of
crime

While
Reg
is
in
prison
Ron
s
mental
instability
and
violent
temperament
lead
to
severe
financial
setbacks
at
the
nightclub
and
it
is
almost
forced
to
close
after
Ron
scares
away
most
of
the
customers

On
the
first
night
after
Reg
s
release
from
prison
the
brothers
have
an
all
out
fist
fight
but
they
manage
to
patch
things
up
at
least
partially

The
brothers
are
approached
by
Angelo
Bruno
of
the
Philadelphia
crime
family
who
on
behalf
of
Meyer
Lansky
and
the
American
Mafia
wants
to
engage
them
in
a
crime
syndicate
deal

Bruno
agrees
to
a
fifty
fifty
deal
with
Reg
to
split
London
s
underground
gambling
profits
in
exchange
for
local
protection
by
the
brothers

Initially
this
system
is
highly
lucrative
for
the
Kray
brothers
however
Ron
s
paranoia
and
inclination
towards
violence
causes
problems
for
Reg
s
efforts
to
maintain
control

Ron
s
barely
concealed
volatility
results
in
him
publicly
murdering
George
Cornell
an
associate
of
the
Torture
Gang

As
a
result
Scotland
Yard
opens
a
full
investigation
of
the
Kray
brothers

Reg
s
marriage
with
Frances
crumbles
owing
to
his
addiction
to
crime

Unable
to
bear
Reg
s
false
promises
to
reform
Frances
starts
consuming
prescription
drugs
illegally

After
he
beats
and
rapes
her
in
a
fit
of
rage
she
leaves
him

When
Reg
approaches
her
to
reconcile
Frances
seems
to
agree
and
they
plan
to
visit
Ibiza
but
she
kills
herself
with
a
drug
overdose
leaving
Reg
ridden
with
guilt

The
twins
criminal
activities
continue
and
Ron
pays
petty
criminal
Jack
the
Hat
McVitie
to
kill
Leslie
Payne
Reg
s
partner
who
controls
the
legal
side
of
the
Krays
operations
as
he
does
not
trust
Payne

Jack
only
wounds
Payne
who
then
turns
the
brothers
over
to
Detective
Superintendent
Leonard
Nipper
Read
the
head
of
the
investigation

Reg
finds
out
and
brutally
stabs
McVitie
with
a
knife
during
a
party
hosted
by
Ron

The
testimony
given
by
Payne
means
that
Ron
is
arrested
and
charged
with
Cornell
s
murder

The
final
scene
shows
a
police
squad
breaking
down
the
door
to
Reggie
s
flat
in
order
to
apprehend
him
for
McVitie
s
murder

The
closing
captions
indicate
both
brothers
receiving
criminal
convictions
for
murder

They
died
five
years
apart
Ron
from
a
heart
attack
in
and
Reggie
from
bladder
cancer
in

On
October
it
was
announced
that
Brian
Helgeland
had
written
a
script
and
would
be
directing
a
film
focusing
on
the
life
of
Reggie
Kray
who
with
identical
brother
Ronald
formed
the
notorious
Kray
twins

Helgeland
said
the
film
would
concentrate
on
Reggie
s
attempts
to
control
the
psychopathic
tendencies
of
his
younger
twin

Helgeland
spoke
of
hanging
out
in
London
with
well
known
Krays
associate
Freddie
Foreman
saying
I
had
drinks
with
him
in
his
local
haunt

When
we
finished
he
got
up
to
go
and
they
feted
him
at
the
bar

I
said
to
him
what
about
the
bill
and
he
replied
we
don
t
pay

Helgeland
attended
the
Cannes
Film
Festival
with
Working
Title
s
Tim
Bevan
and
Chris
Clark
to
talk
to
potential
buyers
of
the

showing
test

Five
days
later
it
was
stated
that
Browning
was
in
negotiations
for
a
role
as
the
film
s
female
lead

Hardy
was
so
set
on
playing
Ronnie
Kray
that
he
proposed
to
Helgeland
that
if
he
gave
him
the
role
of
Ronnie
Hardy
would
play
the
role
of
Reggie
for
free

June
the
first
image
of
the
film
was
published

Hardy
as

publicity
because
it
made
a
two
star
review
from
The

appear
to
be
at
least
a
four
star
review
by
placing
the
two
stars
between
the
heads
of
the
Krays

In
this
painting
of
Lady
Godiva
by
John
Collier
the
authentic
historical
person
is
fully
submerged
in
the
legend
presented
in
an
anachronistic
high
medieval
setting

A
legend
is
a
genre
of
folklore
that
consists
of
a
narrative
featuring
human
actions
believed
or
perceived
to
have
taken
place
in
human
history

Narratives
in
this
genre
may
demonstrate
human
values
and
possess
certain
qualities
that
give
the
tale
verisimilitude

Legend
for
its
active
and
passive
participants
may
include
miracles

Legends
may
be
transformed
over
time
to
keep
them
fresh
and
vital

Many
legends
operate
within
the
realm
of
uncertainty
never
being
entirely
believed
by
the
participants
but
also
never
being
resolutely
doubted

Legends
are
sometimes
distinguished
from
myths
in
that
they
concern
human
beings
as
the
main
characters
and
do
not
necessarily
have
supernatural
origins
and
sometimes
in
that
they
have
some
sort
of
historical
basis
whereas
myths
generally
do
not

The
Brothers
Grimm
defined
legend
as
folktale
historically
grounded


A
by
product
of
the
concern
with
human
beings
is
the
long
list
of
legendary
creatures
leaving
no
resolute
doubt
that
legends
are
historically
grounded

A
modern
folklorist
s
professional
definition
of
legend
was
proposed
by
Timothy
R

Tangherlini
in
Legend
typically
is
a
short
mono
episodic
traditional
highly
ecotypified
historicized
narrative
performed
in
a
conversational
mode
reflecting
on
a
psychological
level
a
symbolic
representation
of
folk
belief
and
collective
experiences
and
serving
as
a
reaffirmation
of
commonly
held
values
of
the
group
to
whose
tradition
it
belongs

Etymology
and
origin
edit
px
Holger
danske

Holger
Danske
a
legendary
character
Legend
is
a
loanword
from
Old
French
that
entered
English
usage
c



The
Old
French
noun
legende
derives
from
the
Medieval
Latin
legenda

In
its
early
English
language
usage
the
word
indicated
a
narrative
of
an
event

The
word
legendary
was
originally
a
noun
introduced
in
the
s
meaning
a
collection
or
corpus
of
legends

This
word
changed
to
legendry
and
legendary
became
the
adjectival
form

By
English
speaking
Protestants
began
to
use
the
word
when
they
wished
to
imply
that
an
event
especially
the
story
of
any
saint
not
acknowledged
in
John
Foxe
s
Actes
and
Monuments
was
fictitious

Thus
legend
gained
its
modern
connotations
of
undocumented
and
spurious
which
distinguish
it
from
the
meaning
of
chronicle

In
Jacob
Grimm
described
the
fairy
tale
as
poetic
legend
historic

Early
scholars
such
as
Karl
Wehrhan
de
Friedrich
Ranke
and
Will
Erich
Peuckert
followed
Grimm
s
example
in
focussing
solely
on
the
literary
narrative
an
approach
that
was
enriched
particularly
after
the
s
by
addressing
questions
of
performance
and
the
anthropological
and
psychological
insights
provided
in
considering
legends
social
context

Questions
of
categorising
legends
in
hopes
of
compiling
a
content
based
series
of
categories
on
the
line
of
the
Aarne
Thompson
folktale
index
provoked
a
search
for
a
broader
new
synthesis

In
an
early
attempt
at
defining
some
basic
questions
operative
in
examining
folk
tales
Friedrich
Ranke
de
in
characterised
the
folk
legend
as
a
popular
narrative
with
an
objectively
untrue
imaginary
content
a
dismissive
position
that
was
subsequently
largely
abandoned

Compared
to
the
highly
structured
folktale
legend
is
comparatively
amorphous
Helmut
de
Boor
noted
in


The
narrative
content
of
legend
is
in
realistic
mode
rather
than
the
wry
irony
of
folktale
Wilhelm
Heiske
remarked
on
the
similarity
of
motifs
in
legend
and
folktale
and
concluded
that
in
spite
of
its
realistic
mode
legend
is
not
more
historical
than
folktale

In
Einleitung
in
der
Geschichtswissenschaft
Ernst
Bernheim
asserted
that
a
legend
is
simply
a
longstanding
rumour

Gordon
Allport
credited
the
staying
power
of
some
rumours
to
the
persistent
cultural
state
of
mind
that
they
embody
and
capsulise
thus
Urban
legends
are
a
feature
of
rumour

When
Willian
Hugh
Jansen
suggested
that
legends
that
disappear
quickly
were
short
term
legends
and
the
persistent
ones
be
termed
long
term
legends
the
distinction
between
legend
and
rumour
was
effectively
obliterated
Tangherlini
concluded

Christian
legenda
edit
Main
article
Legendary
hagiography
In
a
narrow
Christian
sense
legenda
things
to
be
read
on
a
certain
day
in
church
were
hagiographical
accounts
often
collected
in
a
legendary

Because
saints
lives
are
often
included
in
many
miracle
stories
legend
in
a
wider
sense
came
to
refer
to
any
story
that
is
set
in
a
historical
context
but
that
contains
supernatural
divine
or
fantastic
elements

Oral
tradition
edit
Main
article
Oral
tradition
History
preserved
orally
through
many
generations
often
takes
on
a
more
narrative
based
or
mythological
form
over
time
an
example
being
the
oral
traditions
of
the
African
Great
Lakes

The
legend
on
the
other
hand
has
of
necessity
some
historical
or
topographical
connection

It
refers
imaginary
events
to
some
real
personage
or
it
localizes
romantic
stories
in
some
definite
spot

From
the
moment
a
legend
is
retold
as
fiction
its
authentic
legendary
qualities
begin
to
fade
and
recede
in
The
Legend
of
Sleepy
Hollow
Washington
Irving
transformed
a
local
Hudson
River
Valley
legend
into
a
literary
anecdote
with
Gothic
overtones
which
actually
tended
to
diminish
its
character
as
genuine
legend

Stories
that
exceed
the
boundaries
of
realism
are
called
fables


For
example
the
talking
animal
formula
of
Aesop
identifies
his
brief
stories
as
fables
and
not
legends

The
parable
of
the
Prodigal
Son
would
be
a
legend
if
it
were
told
as
having
actually
happened
to
a
specific
son
of
a
historical
father

If
it
included
a
donkey
that
gave
sage
advice
to
the
Prodigal
Son
it
would
be
a
fable

Urban
legends
are
a
modern
genre
of
folklore
that
is
rooted
in
local
popular
culture
usually
comprising
fictional
stories
that
are
often
presented
as
true
with
macabre
or
humorous
elements

These
legends
can
be
used
for
entertainment
purposes
as
well
as
semi
serious
explanations
for
seemingly
mysterious
events
such
as
disappearances
and
strange
objects

The
term
urban
legend
as
generally
used
by
folklorists
has
appeared
in
print
since
at
least


Jan
Harold
Brunvand
professor
of
English
at
the
University
of
Utah
introduced
the
term
to
the
general
public
in
a
series
of
popular
books
published
beginning
in


Brunvand
used
his
collection
of
legends
The
Vanishing
Hitchhiker
American
Urban
Legends
Their
Meanings
to
make
two
points
first
that
legends
and
folklore
do
not
occur
exclusively
in
so
called
primitive
or
traditional
societies
and
second
that
one
could
learn
much
about
urban
and
modern
culture
by
studying
such
tales

A
story
or
group
of
stories
handed
down
through
popular
oral
tradition
usually
consisting
of
an
exaggerated
or
unreliable
account
of
some
actually
or
possibly
historical
person
often
a
saint
monarch
or
popular
hero

Legends
are
sometimes
distinguished
from
myths
in
that
they
concern
human
beings
rather
than
gods
and
sometimes
in
that
they
have
some
sort
of
historical
basis
whereas
myths
do
not
but
these
distinctions
are
difficult
to
maintain
consistently

The
term
was
originally
applied
to
accounts
of
saints
lives

Myths
are
often
associated
with
theology
and
ritual

Their
main
characters
are
not
usually
human
beings
but
they
often
have
human
attributes
they
are
animals
deities
or
culture
heroes
whose
actions
are
set
in
an
earlier
world
when
the
earth
was
different
from
what
it
is
today
or
in
another
world
such
as
the
sky
or
underworld



Legends
are
more
often
secular
than
sacred
and
their
principal
characters
are
human

They
tell
of
migrations
wars
and
victories
deeds
of
past
heroes
chiefs
and
kings
and
succession
in
ruling
dynasties

Legend
now
sat
at
the
top
spot
on
Netflix
in
the
UK
famously
wedged
a
two
star
Guardian
review
between
Tom
Hardy
s
Kray
twins
on
its
promotional
poster
cheekily
disguised
as
if
the
critic
s
take
was
more
favourable
with
the
two
outer
stars
covered
over

In
ways
that
sums
up
Guy
Ritchie
s
gangster
biopic
a
showy
ostentatious
wannabe
prestige
thing
clearly
gunning
for
bonafides
with
all
the
trappings
of
awards
bait
but
without
the
formal
ingenuity
or
pizzazz
on
the
page
to
justify
it

The
saving
grace
Hardy

Hardy
plays
two
roles
in
one
sharing
similar
screen
time
and
indeed
through
some
nifty
effects
work
often
the
same
frame
both
Ronnie
and
Reggie
Kray
the
nefarious
sibling
clubland
duo
who
swindled
and
savoured
s
London
in
equal
measure

They
rubbed
shoulders
with
the
best
and
brightest
in
town
from
Julie
Garland
through
to
Frank
Sinatra
brutally
extorting
the
local
nightclubs
while
cultivating
a
chic
suited
and
booted
image
with
the
city
elites

Legend
isn
t
a
good
movie

Structurally
it
s
drab
and
conventional
an
elliptical
chronology
of
Kray
moments
loosely
knitted
together
by
the
narration
of
Reggie
s
beleaguered
beau
Frances
Emily
Browning


It
s
shot
and
designed
with
all
the
colour
of
an
old
faded
postage
stamp
functionally
framed
like
a
s
soap
demonstrating
little
in
the
way
of
thought
around
visual
language
for
all
of
Ritchie
s
pulpish
strengths
he
s
never
been
great
at
placing
a
camera


So
thank
god
for
Hardy
making
it
watchable

It
s
a
two
hander
for
the
most
part
the
genius
of
that
being
that
the
hands
in
play
are
both
Hardy

But
the
Krays
despite
their
identical
appearance
were
far
from
the
same
person
Reg
was
the
calm
headed
leader
of
the
pack
Ron
more
off
kilter
and
as
a
paranoid
schizophrenic
shown
to
be
liable
to
flashes
of
violence

Reg
speaks
with
a
roguish
twang
appears
more
chiselled
and
handsome
and
certainly
more
approachable
a
lad
your
nan
might
invite
in
for
tea
and
cake

Ronnie
variously
communicates
through
his
nose
or
with
a
bark
little
between

The
contrast
Hardy
captures
between
the
two
men
is
quite
astounding
their
smallest
specificities
the
sort
you
d
learn
over
time
months
of
orbit
to
distinguish
them
brought
to
the
surface

Playing
two
parts
of
the
same
fraternity
allows
Hardy
to
showcase
all
of
his
emotional
and
physiological
range

Ron
is
carried
with
weightiness
his
chins
gluttonous
and
pouring
over
like
the
gowls
of
a
slobbering
pitbull
Reg
is
commanding
but
light
stepped
svelte
and
debonair

The
first
presents
that
he
will
get
shit
done
in
an
escalate
to
deescalate
fashion
whereas
the
latter
actually
does

It
s
the
juxtaposition
of
power
and
control
as
projected
by
image

Despite
popular
misconception
Hardy
and
the
infamous
Krays
aren
t
exactly
from
the
same
neck
of
the
woods

The
year
old
is
clear
about
this
in
interviews
to
be
fair
in
a
Wired
video
he
described
himself
as
a
bourgeois
posh
middle
class
twat
but
Legend
isn
t
simply
a
case
of
Hardy
falling
back
into
the
working
class
rhythms
of
his
youth

A
lot
of
this
is
owed
to
roles
like
Bronson
Inception
and
Locke
where
Hardy
cultivated
consciously
or
not
a
rough
n
rugged
loveable
bad
boy
image
Legend
being
the
arguable
apex

Seven
years
on
with
Legend
enjoying
something
of
a
resurgence
vis
a
vis
Netflix
you
d
better
believe
there
s
only
one
reason

Here
is
one
work
with
legend
text
getting
cut
off
or
when
you
have
long
legend
values


Turn
off
legends
on
the
various
visuals
you
want
to
display


Create
a
Treemap
visual
with
same
data
columns

Place
its
legend
on
Top
Left


Reduce
height
of
the
Tree
Map
visual
so
that
only
the
Legend
displays

I
set
it
to
px
and
only
the
legend
was
showing

I
set
the
width
of
the
tree
map
visual
as
wide
as
possible
to
accomodate
long
values
in
my
Legend
s
data
category

Hope
this
helps

That
s
right
buddy
MFelix


Though
I
am
asking
for
something
such
as
a
legend
wrap
since
I
have
quite
a
few
categories
and
can
t
go
about
expanding
the
graph
size

The
other
obvious
way
around
it
is
placing
the
legend
to
the
left
or
right
though
I
need
it
at
the
bottom
center

In
Excel
for
example
the
legend
can
be
fit
in
two
three
parallel
lines

Don
t
see
that
happening
here

Hi
Anonymous
There
is
no
such
option
for
legend
wrap
in
Power
BI
now


I
suggest
you
create
an
idea
for
it
in
https
ideas
powerbi
com
forums
power
bi
ideas
to
improve
the
Power
BI

As
a
workaround
you
can
create
a
custom
legend
by
column
chart

For
detailed
steps
you
can
refer
to
the
video

Hi
Anonymous
There
is
no
option
on
the
legends
for
wraping
values
one
option
can
be
to
make
some
sort
of
a
table
or
matrix
visualization
and
used
it
as
your
legend
if
you
group
the
two
together
the
final
user
won
t
realize
they
are
looking
at
different
visuals
however
this
depends
on
the
data

matplotlib
legend
The
legend
module
defines
the
Legend
class
which
is
responsible
for
drawing
legends
associated
with
Axes
and
or
figures

Important
It
is
unlikely
that
you
would
ever
create
a
Legend
instance
manually

Most
users
would
normally
create
a
legend
via
the
legend
function

For
more
details
on
legends
there
is
also
a
legend
guide

The
Legend
class
is
a
container
of
legend
handles
and
legend
texts

The
legend
handler
map
specifies
how
to
create
legend
handles
from
artists
lines
patches
etc

in
the
Axes
or
figures

Default
legend
handlers
are
defined
in
the
legend
handler
module

While
not
all
artist
types
are
covered
by
the
default
legend
handlers
custom
legend
handlers
can
be
defined
to
support
arbitrary
objects

See
the
ref
legend
guide
for
more
information

contains
the
legend

handleslist
of
Artist
or
tuple
of
Artist
A
list
of
Artists
lines

added
to
the
legend

labelslist
of
str
A
list
of
labels
to
show
next
to
the

The
length
of
handles

labels
should
be
the
same

If
they
are
not
they
are
truncated
to
the
length
of
the

of
the
axes
figure

The
string
center
places
the
legend
at
the
center
of
the
axes
figure

The
string
best
places
the
legend
at
the
location
among
the
nine
locations
defined
so
far
with
the
minimum
overlap
with
other
drawn
artists

This
option
can
be
quite
slow
for
plots
with
large
amounts
of
data
your
plotting
speed
may
benefit
from
providing
a
specific
location

The
location
can
also
be
a
tuple
giving
the
coordinates
of
the
lower
left
corner
of
the
legend
in
axes
figure
coordinates
in
which
case
bbox
to
anchor
will
be
ignored


For
back
compatibility
center
right
but
no
other
location
can
also
be
spelled
right
and
each
string
location
can
also
be
given
as
a
numeric
value

If
a
figure
is
using
the
constrained
layout
manager
the
string
codes
of
the
loc
keyword
argument
can
get
better
layout
behaviour
using
the
prefix
outside


There
is
ambiguity
at
the
corners
so
outside
upper
right
will
make
space
for
the
legend
above
the
rest
of
the
axes
in
the
layout
and
outside
right
upper
will
make
space
on
the
right
side
of
the
layout

In
addition
to
the
values
of
loc
listed
above
we
have
outside

See
Legend
guide
for

bbox
to
anchorBboxBase
tuple
or
tuple
of
floats
Box
that
is
used
to
position
the
legend
in
conjunction
with
loc

Defaults
to

bbox

called
as
a
method
to
Axes
legend
or
figure
bbox
if

This
argument
allows
arbitrary
placement
of

legend

Bbox
coordinates
are
interpreted
in
the
coordinate
system
given
by
bbox
transform
with
the
default
transform
Axes
or
Figure
coordinates
depending
on
which
legend
is
called

a
tuple
or
BboxBase
is
given
then
it
specifies

bbox

that
the
legend
is
placed

It
can
be
common
to
want
to
trigger
different
behaviour
when

an
item
in
the

This
can
be
easily
achieved
using
a
callback
in
the

Let
s
say
we
wanted
instead
to

of

We
could
change

accordingly

the

Other

perhaps
even
to
conquer

You
have
a
city
a
loyal
populace
and
a
few
troops
your
power

magic
should
be
sufficient
to
keep
them
alive

that
nothing

Where

Plot
In
the
s
Reggie
Kray
is
a
former
boxer
who
has
become
an
important
part
of
the
criminal
underground
in
London

At
the
start
of
the
film
his
twin
brother
Ron
is
locked
up
in
a
psychiatric
hospital
for
insanity
and
paranoid
schizophrenia

Reggie
uses
threats
to
obtain
the
premature
release
of
his
brother
who
is
rapidly
discharged
from
hospital

The
two
brothers
unite
their
efforts
to
control
a
large
part
of
London
s
criminal
underworld

One
of
their
first
efforts
is
to
muscle
in
on
the
control
of
a
local
night
club
using
extortion
and
brutal
violence

Reggie
enters
into
a
relationship
with
Frances
the
sister
of
his
driver
and
they
ultimately
marry
however
he
is
imprisoned
for
a
previous
criminal
conviction
which
he
cannot
evade

While
Reggie
is
in
prison
Ron
s
mental
problems
and
violence
lead
to
severe
setbacks
at
the
nightclub

The
club
is
almost
forced
to
close
after
Ron
scares
away
most
of
the
customers

When
Reggie
is
finally
released
from
prison
the
two
brothers
have
an
all
out
fist
fight
on
the
first
night
after
Reggie
s
release
but
they
manage
to
partially
patch
things
up

The
brothers
are
approached
by
Angelo
Bruno
of
the
Philadelphia
crime
family
on
behalf
of
Meyer
Lansky
and
the
American
Mafia
to
try
to
interest
them
in
a
crime
syndicate
deal

Bruno
agrees
to
a
fifty
fifty
deal
with
Reggie
to
split
London
s
underground
gambling
profits
in
exchange
for
local
protection
from
the
Kray
brothers

Initially
this
system
is
highly
lucrative
for
the
Kray
brothers

However
the
results
of
Ron
s
barely
concealed
violence
continue
to
cause
problems
with
Scotland
Yard
who
open
a
full
investigation
of
the
Kray
brothers

Reggie
beats
and
rapes
Frances
and
she
leaves
him

Reggie
then
approaches
her
to
start
afresh
offering
her
a
holiday
to
Ibiza

However
she
is
soon
found
dead
after
committing
suicide
with
an
overdose
of
prescription
drugs

The
brothers
criminal
activities
continue
and
they
are
unable
to
thwart
the
escalating
Scotland
Yard
investigation
by
Detective
Superintendent
Leonard
Nipper
Read
who
soon
arrests
Ron

The
final
scene
shows
a
police
squad
breaking
down
the
door
to
Reggie
s
flat
in
order
to
apprehend
him

Krayslegend
Tom
Hardy
as
both
Ronnie
and
Reggie

The
closing
captions
indicate
both
brothers
receiving
criminal
convictions
for
murder

They
died
five
years
apart
Ron
from
a
heart
attack
in
and
Reggie
from
cancer
in


Historical
Inaccuracies
Albert
Donoghue
is
already
working
for
the
Firm
at
the
start
of
the
film
when
Ron
is
in
the
mental
hospital

However
in
real
life
Albert
started
working
for
them
a
few
years
after
Ron
s
release

The
real
life
events
which
are
depicted
in
the
film
happened
throughout
several
years
from
the
late
s
or
early
s
until


However
none
of
the
characters
age
or
start
to
appear
older
as
the
film
goes
on

John
Dickson
and
Pat
Connolly
do
not
have
Scottish
accents
in
the
film
despite
both
in
real
life
hailing
from
Scotland

In
the
scene
where
Ron
meets
Frances
for
the
first
time
he
tells
her
that
he
is
homosexual

However
in
real
life
Ron
claimed
he
was
bisexual

Charlie
Richardson
s
arrest
in
July
is
shown
onscreen
before
George
Cornell
s
death
though
this
could
be
considered
a
flash
forward

The
film
has
a
scene
where
George
Cornell
calls
Ron
a
fat
poof
in
a
confrontation
with
the
twins
in
E

Pellicci
but
in
real
life
Ron
claimed
Cornell
never
called
Ron
a
poof
in
his
life
because
if
he
had
done
Ron
would
have
killed
him
then
and
there

In
real
life
Ron
claimed
to
have
shot
George
Cornell
because
he
threatened
to
kill
him
as
this
made
Ron
decide
to
kill
him
first

In
the
film
however
Ron
shoots
Cornell
for
from
a
dock
worker
who
was
beaten
up
by
Cornell

In
real
life
Ron
claimed
George
Cornell
did
not
say
anything
to
him
when
he
walked
into
The
Blind
Beggar
and
shot
him

Also
the
song
The
Sun
Ain
t
Gonna
Shine
Anymore
was
said
to
have
been
playing
in
the
pub
at
the
time
of
the
shooting
but
in
the
film
no
music
can
be
heard

In
the
film
Reggie
and
Frances
s
eight
month
marriage
falls
apart
when
he
beats
her
up
and
rapes
her

In
real
life
Frances
insisted
Reg
was
never
physically
violent
towards
her

Several
friends
of
theirs
have
corroborated
this

Helgeland
has
since
said
he
used
this
scene
as
part
of
his
poetic
licence

The
escape
and
murder
of
Frank
Mitchell
are
not
mentioned
or
depicted
in
the
movie

This
happened
in
December
whereas
the
movie
jumps
from
Reggie
and
Frances
relationship
ending
occurring
in
to
them
both
getting
tickets
to
go
to
Ibiza
in
order
to
make
amends
occurring
shortly
before
Frances
death
in
June


Allegedly
during
the
morning
after
Frances
death
her
brother
Frank
left
a
cup
of
tea
for
her
in
her
room
before
he
left
go
to
work
unaware
that
she
was
dead

However
in
the
film
he
is
seen
to
have
realised
she
was
dead
after
entering
her
room

Billy
Exley
drove
Jack
McVitie
to
Payne
s
house
to
kill
him
but
in
the
film
Jack
appears
to
be
alone

Payne
also
did
not
answer
the
door
nor
did
McVitie
shoot
him
at
all

The
murder
of
Jack
McVitie
happens
differently
in
the
film

Reggie
suddenly
decides
to
shoot
Jack
after
he
told
Reg
that
it
was
not
his
fault
Frances
killed
herself
instead
of
already
intending
to
do
so
due
to
him
failing
to
kill
Leslie
Payne

He
was
lured
into
the
basement
and
it
was
not
done
within
the
party

Also
Albert
Donoghue
and
Teddy
Smith
were
not
present
at
the
murder

In
real
life
the
Firm
continued
to
operate
for
another
seven
months

hanging
out

haunt

When
we
finished
he
got
up
to
go
and
they
feted
him
at
the
bar

I
said
to
him
what
about
the
bill
and
he
replied
we
don
t
pay

attended
the

Embrace
Your
Fate
In
a
game
of
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
your
cards
are
divided
between
two
decks

The
first
is
the
dynasty
deck
which
contains
your
characters
and
holdings
like
those
shown
above

l
c
anc
cardfan

png
The
second
deck
is
your
conflict
deck
which
has
a
mix
of
characters
attachments
including
weapons
followers
equipment
and
other
conditions
and
events

Between
your
two
decks
are
four
face
down
province
cards
as
shown
below
and
protecting
these
provinces
is
essential
to
maintaining
your
strength
and
defeating
your
opponent

l
c
game
setup
png
At
the
beginning
of
the
game
a
card
from
the
top
of
your
dynasty
deck
is
placed
on
top
of
each
of
the
four
province
cards
between
your
decks
while
the
fifth
province
hosts
your
stronghold

As
the
round
begins
the
dynasty
cards
on
your
four
central
provinces
are
turned
face
up
and
during
the
dynasty
phase
you
and
your
opponent
will
take
turns
playing
characters
from
your
provinces

All
characters
have
a
cost
shown
in
the
upper
left
corner
that
must
be
paid
in
fate
a
currency
that
represents
the
karma
and
destiny
that
a
clan
has
accrued

There
is
an
additional
cost
however
that
must
be
considered

In
Rokugani
culture
a
central
philosophical
concept
is
mono
no
aware

Literally
translating
to
the
pathos
of
things
mono
no
aware
is
an
understanding
and
bittersweet
acceptance
that
everything
in
the
world
is
impermanent
and
transient

In
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
this
is
played
out
through
your
characters
and
your
fate

After
playing
a
character
from
one
of
your
provinces
you
may
choose
to
pay
any
number
of
additional
fate
placing
these
fate
tokens
directly
onto
the
character

For

you
may
choose
to
play
the
Matsu
Berserker
Core
Set
from
a
province
paying
one
fate
as
shown
above

Considering
your
options
you
decide
that
you
will
want
this
character
in
play
for
several
rounds
so
you
place
two
more
fate

your
supply
onto
this
character

At
the
end
of
this
round
one
of
those
fate
tokens
will
be
removed
from
the
Matsu
Berserker

If
you
had
chosen
to
not
place
any
additional
fate
on
the
Matsu
Berserker
this
character
would
have
been
discarded
in

phase
the

Berserker
will
have
fulfilled

at

During
the
fate
phase
at
the
end
of
the
round
the
Steadfast
Samurai
has
no
fate
and
is
discarded

One
fate
is
removed
from
the
Matsu
Berserker

By
placing
additional
fate
tokens
on
a
character
you
are
in
essence
paying
to
keep
that
character
in
play
for
additional
rounds

Choosing
exactly
how
much
fate
to
invest
in
a
character
is
a
key
strategic
decision
If
you
don
t
pay
enough
you
could
find
your
best
characters
have
fulfilled
their
destiny
and
departed
just
when
you
need
them
most

If
you
pay
too
much
however
you
may
have
bound
your
clan
s
destiny
to
a
single
character
which
could
leave
you
vulnerable
to
attacks
on
multiple
fronts

Compounding
the
decision
is
the
fact
that
you
ll
need
to
save
some
fate
if
you
re
going
to
play
conflict
cards
from
your
hand
later
in
the
round

The
clans
gain
more
fate
at
the
beginning
of
each
new

deciding
how
to
use
your
fate
is
crucial
to

Uphold
Your
Honor
After
both
players
have
passed
on
the
chance
to
play
additional
characters
in
the
dynasty
phase
the
game
proceeds
to
the
draw
phase

Here
you
and
your
opponent
each
have
the
chance
to
select
how
many
cards
you
will
draw
from
your
conflict
decks
which
contains
the
tactics
and
maneuvers
that
you
keep
hidden
in
your
hand
but
you
must
be
cautious
because
the
honor
of
your
entire
clan
is
at
stake

Each
player
has
an
honor
dial
featuring
numbers
from
one
to
five

The
number
that
you
select
indicates
how
honorably
you
intend
to
act
during
the
coming
round
with
a
low
number
equating
to
a
more
honorable
path
and
a
high
number
equating
to
a
less
honorable
path

The
number
that
you
select
is
also
the
number
of
cards
that
you
will
draw
from
your
conflict
deck

After
both
players
have
secretly
chosen
a
number
you
will
each
reveal
your
dial
and
draw
the
number
of
cards
that
you
chose
but
if
you
re
relying
on
dishonorable
tricks
from
your
conflict
deck
you
ll
pay
with
your
clan
s
honor

For
instance
if
you
reveal
a
dial
with
a
five
and
your
opponent
reveals
a
dial
with
a
one
you
must
pay
him
four
honor
the
difference
between
the
two
bids

Then
you
would
draw
five
cards
your
bid
he
would
draw
one
card
his
bid
and
the
draw
phase
would
be
complete

l
c
honor
dial
diagram
png
When
setting
a
number
on
your
dial
you
are
essentially
bidding
honor
against
your
opponent

A
low
bid
allows
you
to
preserve
your
honor
or
gain
more
honor
from
your
opponent
and
in
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
maintaining
your
honor
is
of
the
utmost
importance

Choosing
a
higher
number
on
the
other
hand
may
sacrifice
some
honor
but
it
also
fills
your
hand
with
conflict
cards
that
could
give
you
exactly
what
you
need
during
a
conflict
Betting
against
your
opponent
and
guarding
your
honor
leads
to
countless
strategic
moments
during
the
game

Face
Your
Enemy
Once
both
players
have
drawn
cards
conflict
begins
in
earnest
inviting
players
to
initiate
military
and
political
confrontations

These
confrontations
could
represent
pitched
battle
a
physical
fight
a
trial
a
debate
or
a
contest
of
courtly
intrigues
but
in
any
circumstance
your
end
goal
is
to
break
your
opponent
s
provinces

Each
player
has
the
option
to
declare
up
to
two
conflicts
during
the
conflict
phase

Players
alternate
declaring
conflicts
and
each
player
can
initiate
one
military
conflict
and
one
political
conflict

You
may
even
choose
to
pass
your
first
conflict
waiting
to
see
how
your
opponent
acts
and
then
commit
your
full
strength
to
your
second
conflict
later

When
you
do
choose
to
initiate
a
conflict
you
face
an
array
of
strategic
options
and
choices

You
must
choose
which
characters
will
participate
in
the
conflict
while
carefully
ensuring
you
have
enough
characters
left
to
defend
against
your
opponent
because
undefended
provinces
are
easily
broken
and
you
ll
lose
honor
for
failing
to
defend
your
lands

You
must
also
choose
which
enemy
province
to
attack
at
the
start
of
the
game
all
province
cards
are
face
down
hiding
their
true
nature
but
as
your
forces
move
into
enemy
lands
you
ll
discover
what
lies
in
wait
potentially
undermining
your
plans
with
an
unwanted
surprise

Finally
you
must
determine
the
type
and
ring
used
for
the
conflict

Every
conflict
must
be
either
military
or
political
which
corresponds
to
the
military
and
political
skills
of
your
characters
only
the
skill
that
matches
your
chosen
conflict
type
is
used
for
this
conflict

Along
with
the
type
of
conflict
you
ll
select
one
of
the
five
rings
Air
Earth
Fire
Water
or
Void

The
ring
that
you
use
for
the
conflict
determines
the
consequences
if
you
are
victorious
as
the
attacker

play
and

Honoring

dishonoring
a
character
has
a

on
that
character
s
skill
and
causes
you
to
gain
or
lose
honor
when
that
character
leaves
play

Once
the
conflict
has
been

your

and
the

During
the
conflict
you
and
your

will
trade
actions

abilities
and
playing
cards
from
your

to
gain
the

You

Breaking

provinces
moves
you
directly
closer

in
Legend

The

Game

Though
your
opponents
can
still
play
new
cards
from
their
broken
provinces
if
you
break
three
of
your
opponent
s
four
provinces
you
will
be
allowed
to
declare
conflicts
against
their
stronghold

A
clan
s
stronghold
is
the
seat
of
its
power
providing
your
supply
of
fate
determining
your
starting
honor
and
offering
a
powerful
ability
that
can
be
used
throughout
the
game

Underneath
your
stronghold
you
ll
place
a
fifth
province
card
at
the
beginning
of
the
game
like
the
four
province
cards
that
you
ve
placed
between
your
dynasty
deck
and

Your
opponent

stronghold
will
be
the
site
of
a
dramatic
final
conflict
and
whether
that
takes
the
form
of
a
military
siege
or
a

is
up

you

Either
way

conflict
is
not
the
only
way
that
you
can
win
a
game
of
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game

As
previously
mentioned
the
honor
of
your
clan
is
crucial
to
maintaining
your
standing
in
the
Emerald
Empire

If
you
ever
attain
twenty
five
honor
during
the
game
you
immediately
win
the
game
Similarly
you
can
also
shame
and
dishonor
your
opponent
into
nothingness

If
a
player
ever
loses
all
of
his
honor
he
immediately
loses
the
game

With
three
distinct
paths
to
victory
you
ll
have
careful
choices
to
make
both
when
building
your
decks
and
playing
the
game
The
Great
Clans
of
Rokugan
Seven
Great
Clans
await
your
command
in
the
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
Core
Set

For
over
years
the
Great
Clans
have
served
the
Chrysanthemum
Throne
according
to
their
unique
strengths
and
weaknesses

As
new
conflicts
erupt
across
Rokugan
you
ll
need
to
decide
which
clan
has
won
your
loyalty
l
c
art

png
The
Crab
Clan
To
the
south
of
Rokugan
lie
the
blighted
Shadowlands
a
dark
realm
under
the
sway
of
Fu
Leng
and
the
corrupted
armies
from
the
realm
of
Jigoku

The
only
safeguard
between
the
Shadowlands
and
Rokugan
is
the
mighty
Kaiu
Wall
and
its
constructers
and
defenders
the
Crab
Clan

To
those
who
look
upon
the
Crab
kindly
their
strength
is
impressive
and
their
determination
honorable

But
to
those
who
do
not
those
who
benefit
from
the
protection
of
the
Wall
without
knowing
the
sacrifices
it
requires
the
Crab
are
impolite
brutes
too
pigheaded
to
comprehend
the
intricacies
of
court
decorum

Regardless
of
how
others
might
view
them
the
Crab
cannot
mire
themselves
in
bickering
and
intrigue

They
present
their
back
to
the
court
only
so
they
may
more
fully
face
the
true
enemy
in
the
Shadowlands
beyond

As
rugged
stoic
and
tenacious
defenders
of
the
Empire
the
Crab
are
at
their
best
when
they
are
defending
against
attacks
and
reacting
to
an
opponent
s
aggression
weathering
your
opponent
s
best
attacks
and
retaliating
when
your
foe
is
most
vulnerable

As
builders
who
excel
at
living
off
the
land
holdings
are
important
to
the
Crab
to
protect
their
provinces
and
power
their
characters

The
Crane
Clan
To
the
rest
of
the
Empire
the
Crane
are
a
study
in
contrasts

They
are
both
respected
and
hated
for
their
achievements
both
admired
and
envied
for
their
elegance
and
grace

They
are
the
makers
of
beauty
and
beauty
itself
devotees
of
peace
and
civility
who
nonetheless
wield
lethal
blades

From
the
Crane
s
impeccable
garments
which
set
the
standards
for
style
in
the
Empire
to
the
sprawling
beauty
and
wonder
of
their
Fantastic
Gardens
to
their
seemingly
limitless
talent
for
artistic
accomplishments
and
political
dominance
in
Rokugan
s
courts
the
Crane
don
t
simply
define
what
it
means
to
be
a
civilized
Empire
they
are
the
very
civilized
essence
of
Rokugan

The
Crane
are
known
throughout
the
Emerald
Empire
as
a
political
powerhouse
with
wise
and
honorable
courtiers
guiding
the
clan
and
protecting
themselves
from
external
threats

In
the
game
you
must
leverage
this
political
might
to
devastate
your
opponents
during
conflicts
keeping
your
characters
honored
to
increase
their
skill
and
controlling
the
board
by
pushing
your
opponent
s
characters
away

The
Dragon
Clan
In
contrast
to
the
conformity
that
permeates
the
land
of
Rokugan
the
Dragon
Clan
chases
individual
enlightenment

Secluded
in
the
northern
mountains
the
Dragon
rarely
focus
on
the
internal
politics
of
Rokugan
instead
turning
their
eyes
to
the
future
and
the
mysterious
visions
of
their
founder
the
Kami
Togashi

Indeed
few
can
truly
say
they
understand
the
Dragon

Some
insist
their
beloved
paradoxes
and
puzzles
are
no
more
than
a
game
triviality
masquerading
as
depth

To
this
accusation
the
Dragon
quote
a
common
saying
of
their
monks
What
is
wisdom
one
asked

What
is
not
wisdom
the
other
answered

The
Dragon
are
a
mysterious
and
individualistic
clan

The
use
of
attachments
is
one
of
this
clan
s
greatest
strengths
and
it
s
wise
to
invest
in
a
few
powerful
characters
with
plans
to
give
them
multiple
attachments

The
concept
of
balance
is
also
important
to
this
clan
and
they
are
well
suited
for
both
military
and
political
conflicts

You
must
take
advantage
of
this
flexibility
and
strike
wherever
you
opponent
leaves
an
opening

The
Lion
Clan
Sitting
opposed
to
the
Crane
s
political
skills
is
the
pure
military
might
of
the
Lion
Clan

Every
samurai
who
lives
in
Rokugan
measures
courage
honor
and
duty
against
the
standard
set
by
the
Lion
Clan

With
the
largest
standing
army
in
Rokugan
the
Lion
have
earned
their
place
as
the
Right
Hand
of
the
emperor

Above
all
the
Lion
Clan
lives
breathes
and
dies
for
the
Emperor
and
Rokugan

Should
the
interests
of
the
Emperor
and
the
welfare
of
the
Empire
diverge
toward
what
deadly
paths
or
dishonorable
fates
would
the
Lion
march
The
Lion
are
a
proud
aggressive
and
violent
clan
that
leverages
its
strong
military
skill
to
win
conflicts

Lion
decks
frequently
aim
to
swarm
the
play
area
with
characters
strengthening
their
presence
through
numbers

However
Lion
characters
with
political
skill
are
harder
to
come
by
so
it
s
important
to
have
some
extra
fate
to
keep
your
few
courtiers
and
politicians
in
play

The
Phoenix
Clan
The
Phoenix
is
a
symbol
of
contradictions
explosive
power
and
great
restraint
vast
intelligence
and
deep
humility
immolating
self
sacrifice
and
glorious
rebirth

These
entwined
virtues
illuminate
the
path
of
Rokugan
s
most
mystical
Great
Clan
the
keepers
of
the
Tao
of
Shinsei
and
caretakers
of
the
Empire
s
soul

The
Phoenix
are
the
masters
of
magic
in
Rokugan
but
they
are
also
staunch
pacifists
with
little
interest
in
warfare

Wise
players
will
use
the
clan
s
shugenja
to
trigger
powerful
effects
against
your
opponent
from
the
safety
of
your
home
area

The
clan
s
mastery
of
the
elemental
rings
will
also
help
to
deny
your
opponent
the
effects
they
aim
to
use
against
you
while
ensuring
you
can
use
the
rings
you
need
to
win

This
clan
s
distaste
for
violence
can
also
be
used
as
a
calming
influence
upon
your
opponent
making
overt
aggression
and
military
conflicts
much
less
effective
against
you

The
Scorpion
Clan
With
six
terrible
words
the
Kami
Bayushi
set
his
followers
in
the
newly
founded
Scorpion
Clan
on
a
dark
and
dangerous
path

Enemies
loomed
beyond
Rokugan
s
borders
but
they
also
lurked
within
them

Bayushi
swore
to
protect
the
Empire
by
any
means
necessary

Where
the
Code
of
Bushid
tied
the
Emperor
s
Left
and
Right
Hands
the
courtiers
of
the
Crane
and
the
mighty
legions
of
the
Lion
the
Emperor
s
Underhand
could
still
reach

To
combat
the
liars
the
thieves
and
the
traitors
within
the
Great
Clans
Bayushi
s
followers
would
have
to
lie
steal
and
cheat
in
turn

The
weapons
of
the
Scorpion
became
blackmail
and
poison
and
sabotage

The
Scorpion
dirtied
their
hands
so
that
others
could
remain
pure

Yet
in
spite
of
and
perhaps
because
of
the
clan
s
fearsome
reputation
there
is
none
more
loyal
than
a
Scorpion

In
a
clan
of
deceivers
and
manipulators
trust
is
a
hard
earned
treasure
to
be
cherished
and
guarded

Such
fierce
loyalty
is
a
small
consolation
at
least
given
the
dangerous
but
vital
role
the
Scorpion
have
played
in
the
Empire
from
the
moment
their
Kami
spoke
his
fateful
words
I
will
be
your
villain
Hantei

While
playing
the
Scorpion
Clan
you
ll
want
to
make
high
honor
bids
in
order
to
draw
extra
cards
and
surprise
your
opponents
with
potent
tricks
and
traps

Yet
you
must
always
maintain
your
deepest
loyalty
lest
you
lose
all
honor
and
the
game

Dishonor
is
also
a
powerful
tool
when
turned
against
your
foes
to
keep
their
skill
low
and
their
hopes
of
beating
you
in

The
Unicorn
Clan
For
years
the
Ki
Rin
Clan
journeyed
beyond
Rokugan
s
borders
in
search
of
external
threats
to
the
Emerald
Empire

In
these
foreign
lands
the
clan
learned
to
adapt
to
do
whatever
it
took
to
survive

The
clan
eventually
returned
to
Rokugan
rechristened
as
the
Unicorn
Clan
its
members
speaking
foreign
tongues
wielding
strange
weapons
and
drawing
upon
the
kami
using
sorcery
known
as
meish
d


The
Unicorn
s
return
was
greeted
as
a
barbarian
invasion
carving
a
place
in
Rokugani
society
by
breaking
through
the
defenses
mounted
by
the
Crab
and
Lion
clans

Reintegration
has
not
been
without
difficulty
but
there
are
lights
in
the
darkness

An
ancient
treaty
with
the
Crane
was
honored
providing
the
Unicorn
a
strong
ally
within
the
Empire

The
Phoenix
watch
Unicorn
magic
with
equal
parts
interest
and
concern

The
Dragon
perceive
the
wisdom
of
Shinjo
s
children
the
Scorpion
see
the
advantage
in
a
pliable
ally
and
all
Rokugan
marvels
at
the
speed
and
might
of
their
magnificent
steeds

Perhaps
they
are
finally
where
they
belong

The
Unicorn
are
an
aggressive
practical
and
nomadic
clan
that
has
mastered
the
arts
of
mobility
and
warfare

You
must
use
the
clan
s
powerful
cavalry
characters
to
outmaneuver
your
opponent
during
conflicts
brining
your
characters
into
and
out
of
conflict
to
keep
your
opponent
on
edge

The
Unicorn
are
strongest
when
they
are
first
to
act
and
much
more
comfortable
attacking
than
defending
so
be
sure
to
play
aggressively
and
get
to
your
opponent
before
they
get
to
you

Enter
the
Emerald
Empire
The
world
of
Rokugan
is
spread
out
before
you
choose
your
clan
and
uphold
your
honor
with
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
What
are
the
major
changes
from
the
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
collectible
card
game
As
part
of
the
transition
for
a
collectible
card
game
CCG
to
a
Living
Card
Game
LCG
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
had
to
go
through
a
significant
transformation
and
although
there
are
many
familiar
elements
within
the
game
the
gameplay
itself
is
very
different

Because
of
this
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
is
incompatible
with
the
CCG
version
of
the
game

Below
we
ll
highlight
a
few
of
the
most
important
differences
with
the
new
version
of
the
game

Provinces
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
uses
a
very
familiar
game
layout
with
a
dynasty
deck
containing
characters
and
holdings
on
your
left
and
a
conflict
deck
containing
a
limited
number
of
characters
that
can
be
played
from
your
hand
attachments
and
events
on
your
right

Between
these
two
decks
are
four
provinces
that
hold
cards
from
your
dynasty
deck
as
in
the
CCG

However
each
province
is
now
represented
by
its
own
individual
card

Province
cards
offer
different
strengths
and
abilities
and
choosing
your
provinces
is
an
important
part
of
deckbuilding

Furthermore
when
a
province
is
broken
it
does
not
disappear
preventing
a
snowball
effect
that
weakens
a
player
who
starts
losing
provinces

Characters
Characters
in
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
take
on
a
different
form
than
the
characters
in
the
CCG

First
characters
now
feature
different
stats
reflecting
their
military
and
political
skill
instead
of
the
force
and
chi
stats

These
new
skills
are
used
in
the
revised
conflict
system
that
we
discuss
below

Characters
no
longer
have
honor
requirements
and
their
personal
honor
is
incorporated
into
their
glory
and
the
Honored
Dishonored
status
cards

l
c

Conflict
The
conflict
system
for
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
has
been
completely
redesigned

There
are
now
two
different
types
of
conflicts
military
and
political

The
conflict
type
determines
which
skill
your
characters
will
use

In
other
words
during
a
military
conflict
you
will
compare
your
characters
military
skill
against
the
military
skill
of
your
opponent
s
characters

During
the
conflict
you
and
your
opponent
will
manipulate
the
skill
of
your
characters
by
triggering
abilities
from
cards
in
play
and
playing
cards
from
your
conflict
hand

Like
events
the
attachments
and
characters
in
your
conflict
deck
can
be
played
directly
into
a
conflict
to
affect
the
result
of
the
ongoing
struggle

In
addition
the
titular
five
rings
are
inherently
tied
to
conflict
rather
than
taking
the
place
of
cards
in
the
deck

When
you
declare
a
conflict
you
will
choose
one
of
the
five
rings

If
you
win
the
conflict
as
the
attacker
the
ring
that
you
chose
determines
the
rewards
that
you
claim

In
addition
the
loser
of
a
conflict
no
longer
loses
all
of
his
characters

For
more
information
on
conflicts

the
Face
Your
Enemy
section

on
this
page

Resources
The
resource
system
for
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
has
also
been
completely
redesigned

The
resources
that
you
obtain
are
no
longer
based
on
holdings
instead
you
will
receive
a
set
quantity
of
fate
the
game
s
central
currency
at
the
beginning
of
each
round

The
amount
of
fate
you
receive
is
decided
by
your
stronghold

There
are
multiple
ways
to
gain
more
fate
over
the
course
of
the
game
but
these
are
built
into
the
game
mechanics
unrelated
to
holdings

In
addition
you
are
now
able
to
carryover
excess
fate
into
future
rounds
rewarding
you
for
choosing
to
save
some
of
your
fate
in
order
to
have
more
flexible
options
in
the
future

l
c
art

png
The
Fate
Phase
Unlike
in
the
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
CCG
your
characters
no
longer
remain
in
play
indefinitely
unless
removed
by
a
card
effect


Instead
when
you
play
a
character
from
your
province
or
your
conflict
hand
you
may
choose
to
place
any
number
of
additional
fate
tokens
on
it
from
your
supply
of
fate

During
the
fate
phase
at
the
end
of
each
round
one
of
these
fate
tokens
will
be
removed
or
if
the
character
has
no
fate
tokens
the
character
will
be
discarded

For
more
information
on
the
fate
phase
read
the
Embrace
Your
Fate
section
further
up
on
this
page

Honor
Honor
plays
a
significant
role
in
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
but
fundamentally
honor
effects
are
tied
to
conflicts

You
will
need
to
engage
in
conflicts
if
you
re
planning
to
advance
your
agenda
whether
you
re
attempting
to
increase
your
own
honor
or
dishonor
your
opponent

In
addition
a
character
s
status
as
honored
or
dishonored
can
have
a
significant
impact
on
its
military
and
political
skill

An
honored
character
adds
its
glory
to
its
military
and
political
skills
while
a
dishonored
character
subtracts
its
glory
from
its
military
and
political
skills

Dueling
Mechanics
for
dueling
are
present
in
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
The
Card
Game
but
it
will
function
completely
differently
than
in
the
collectible
card
game

What
is
happening
with
the
Legend
of
the
Five
Rings
storyline
It
is
an
era
of
sudden
change
and
upheaval
in
the
Emerald
Empire

Mortal
schemes
elemental
imbalances
and
celestial
turmoil
have
disrupted
the
political
military
and
spiritual
equilibrium
of
Rokugan

Long
simmering
rivalries
and
fresh
betrayals
ripple
through
the
courts
and
on
the
battlefield

The
Chrysanthemum
Throne
is
beset
by
threats
from
without
and
within
and
the
honor
of
the
seven
Great
Clans
shall
be
put
to
the
test

After
a
devastating
tsunami
strikes
their
coastal
farmland
the
Crane
Clan
balances
on
the
precipice
of
famine
and
war

Doji
Hotaru
the
young
Crane
Clan
Champion
who
grew
up
in
the
shadow
of
her
father
the
legendary
Emerald
Champion
Doji
Satsume
must
defend
her
clan
s
artistic
legacy
political
clout
and
extensive
borders
with
honor
alone

l
c

While
the
Crane
have
been
laid
low
the
Scorpion
Clan
has
ascended
to
the
height
of
glory

Bayushi
Shoju
is
the
trusted
friend
Emperor
Hantei
XXXVIII
while
his
impossibly
beautiful
wife
Kachiko
serves
as
the
Emperor
s
Imperial
Advisor

No
word
is
whispered
in
the
Imperial
Capital
that
escapes
the
Scorpion
Clan
s
ears
and
no
plot
is
hatched
that
evades
the
notice
of
its
agents

The
Scorpion
maintain
a
tenuous
alliance
with
the
Lion
Clan
s
leader
Akodo
Arasou
who
seeks
to
carry
out
an
age
old
vendetta
against
the
Crane
at
the
side
of
his
beloved
the
warrior
Matsu
Tsuko

No
army
can
withstand
the
ferocity
and
tenacity
of
the
Lion
s
warriors
or
the
stratagems
of
the
clan
s
brilliant
new
general
Akodo
Toturi

The
Lion
s
unconventional
neighbors
the
Unicorn
Clan
struggle
to
reconcile
their
foreign
customs
with
the
laws
and
traditions
of
Rokugan

Shinjo
Altansarnai
believes
she
has
brokered
a
peace
with
the
Lion
Clan
at
last
but
the
fiery
Utaku
Kamoko
may
not
be
able
to
leash
her
hatred
for
the
Lion
whom
she
believes
murdered
her
mother

The
Phoenix
Clan

a
wary
eye

the
talismanic
name
magic
practiced
by
the
Unicorn
and
fear
the
imbalance
that
foreign
sorcery
has
wrought

Shiba
Ujimitsu
must
prepare
to
defend
his
clan
s
borders
while
the
prayers
of
the
Phoenix
s
mystical
shugenja
go
awry

The
Council
of
Elemental
Masters
cannot
explain
the
disquiet
affecting
the
elemental
kami
and
so
they
turn
to
forgotten
or
forbidden
lore
for
answers

In
the
secluded
mountains
of
the
far
north
the
Dragon
Clan
beset
by
a
failing
birthrate
and
the
surging
popularity
of
a
potentially
dangerous
and
heretical
sect
of
Shinseism
looks
to
the
guidance
of
its
enigmatic
champion
Togashi
Yokuni
to
restore
the
clan
s
enlightened
way
of

this
infighting

demons
known
as
oni
threaten
to
spread
their
darkness

destroy
civilization

support
of

to

back
the
tide
of
destruction
or

evil
Shadowlands
onslaught

Who
among

clans
will
prove
strong
enough
to
guide

tumultuous
times
Will
their
names
be
lifted

Could
you
clarify
what
s
the
issue
Also
be
aware
that
legend
spacing
y
sets
the
spacing
between
legends
whereas
legend

key

spacing
y
sets
the
spacing
between
the
keys
or
items

Yes
I
get
the
difference
between
legend
spacing
y
and
legend
key
spacing
y

The
publisher
wants
less
space
between
the
key
items

The
greatest
athlete
of
the
st
century
That
s
easy

It
has
to
be
Tom
Brady
the
quarterback
of
the
greatest
dynasty
America
s
favorite
sport
has
ever
seen
a
seven
time
Super
Bowl
champ
and
five
time
Super
Bowl
MVP

Yep

Tom
Brady

Except

Except
it
has
to
be
Lionel
Messi
the
best
player
in
the
world
s
favorite
sport
an
eight
time
Ballon
d
Or
winner
as
the
footballer
of
the
year

Yep
definitely
Messi

Except




no

No
athlete
has
dominated
the
public
conversation
like
LeBron
has

He
has
to
be
No



Except
what
about
Serena
Williams
Winner
of
Grand
Slam
titles
the
Serena
Slam
holding
all
four
major
titles
at
the
same
time
and
four
Olympic
gold
medals

And
she
got
her
final
Grand
Slam
event
win
while
pregnant
putting
her
career
on
hold
while
she
was
at
her
most
dominant

Except
if
you
are
going
to
pick
a
tennis
player
what
about
Roger
Federer
He
transformed
an
entire
sport
with
his
artistry
his
chess
game
on
the
court
his
blazing
forehand

He
won
Grand
Slam
titles
and
became
the
most
beloved
tennis
player
of
all
time

Gotta
be
Fed

Yeah
except
Rafael
Nadal
won
Grand
Slam
titles
and
Novak
Djokovic
has
won


You
have
to
pick
one
of
them
over
Federer

Hmm

Maybe
this
isn
t
so
easy

We
didn
t
even
mention
the
Olympians
Usain
Bolt
and
Michael
Phelps
and
Katie
Ledecky
and
Simone

ranking

for

He
won
seven

but
only
four
of
those
came
after
as
did
of
his

Or

all

came
in

Tiger
won

his

from
on
so
he
s
in

Other
athletes
such
as
Patrick
Mahomes
or
Nikola
Jokic
or
Shohei

obviously
have
more
greatness
ahead
of

we

But
it

and
remained

in

The

of

of

and
it

even
rank

It
might
not

This
is
what

rests
on
No

has

night
in

of

is
merely
one
of

James
has
in
the
playoffs
alone

That
win
paved
the
way
to
his
first
Finals
starting
a
run
of
appearances
in
years

During
that
stretch
he
won
four
NBA
titles
four

and
four

with
three
different
teams
as
well
as
two

the

isn

measure
achievement
in

anymore
and
it
lends
credence
to
those
who
want
to
push
James
down

It

side
of
the
argument
to

Ronaldo
s
story
is
one
of
a
supremely
talented
athlete
but
with
a
drive
and
will
to
win
to
match

His
career
is
best
summed
up
by
one
of
his
own
quotes
If
you
don
t
believe
you
are
the
best
then
you
will
never
achieve
all
that
you
are
capable
of

Ronaldo
has
shown
that
belief
throughout
more
than
two
decades
at
the
top
of
world
soccer
and
often
proved
it
to
be
true

He
is
the
best
said
his
former
Real
Madrid
manager
Jose
Mourinho

I
saw
Maradona
a
couple
of
times

I
never
saw
Pele

But
Cristiano
is
amazing

This
man
is
the
best

Cristiano
is

machine

There
will
never
be

At

had

his

drive
off
it
helped
turn

The
combination
of
his

talent
and
his
blinding
desire
to
win
at
all
costs
made
him
enthralling

per

Only
three
hitters
have
piled
up
more
WAR
since

than
Trout
and
all
of
them
had
more
than
a

start
on
him
when
he
launched
fully
formed
into
the
majors
at
age
two
years
after
going
th
in

That
s
how
quickly
Trout
leaped
into
the
conversation
about
the
game
s
historical
elite

As
perhaps
the
first
star
whose
greatness
was
sharpened
by
contemporary
analytics
Trout
s
all
around
dominance
was
on
display
from
the
start

At
Trout
has
won
three
MVP
awards
and
finished
in
the
top
five
of
balloting
seven
other
times

Injuries
have
slowed
his
momentum
but
if
Trout
can
string
together
a
few
more
healthy
campaigns
the
kid
from
Millville
New

could
yet
transcend
his
status
as
the

He

in

The
brilliance

perhaps
dimmed
a

because
he

up
with

Chris

And
the

that

He
had

over

That
includes
when

he
went

two

and
eight
walks
in
the
Fall

against
a
St

Jimmie
Johnson
auto
racing
Key
accomplishments
Seven
time
NASCAR
Cup
Series
champion
tied
for
most
all
time
with
Dale
Earnhardt
and
Richard
Petty
only
driver
to
win
five
straight
titles


The
challenge
when
it
comes
to
covering
Johnson
s
career
is
having
to
continuously
find
new
ways
to
express
Hey
y
all
this
guy
he
s
really
great
at
racing
stock
cars
isn
t
he
And
that
s
only
the
second
best
compliment
I
can
give
to
the
man
who
won
seven
NASCAR
Cup
Series
titles
equaling
Richard
Petty
and
Dale
Earnhardt
including
five
in
a
row
a
mark
of
which
The
King
and
The
Intimidator
never
came
close

But
Johnson
s
most
mind
bending
accomplishment
is
that
he
won
those
Cups
even
as
the
system
that
awarded
them
was
seemingly
and
repeatedly
rigged
against
him

The
paddock
called
it
Jimmie
Proofing
as
his
septet
of
titles
were
earned
via
three
different
points
systems
and
four
postseason
format
variations
all
while
steering
three
wildly
different
generations
of
race
cars

Meanwhile
he
somehow
has
remained
true
to
his
SoCal
desert
town
trailer
park
roots
as
kind
and
humble
as
he
was
fast
and
unbeatable

But
his
most

feat
is
undoubtedly
going

He
was
outstanding
in
that
campaign
leading
his
team
to
an
achievement
never

I
believe
Thierry
was
on

level
as

definitely

He
was
an
exceptional
football
player
but
as
well
a

of

huge

Even

the

Ovechkin

come
in

because
of
how
he
uses

Rory

Key

spent
as
world
No

golfer
PGA
Tour
victories
including
four
major
wins
a
Masters
victory
shy
of
completing
career
Grand
Slam

After
McIlroy
won
his
first
two
major
championships
the
U
S

Open
and
PGA
Championship
by
eight
strokes
and
then
added
two
more
majors
in
a
three
week
span
in
The
Guardian
of
London
declared
that
it
was
the
dawning
of
a
new
era

There
s
no
question
McIlroy
has
been
one
of
the
most
consistent
and
popular
golfers
of
his
generation

He
has
won
times
including
times
on
the
PGA
Tour

He
is
a
three
time
PGA
Tour
Player
of
the
Year
and
a
five
time
winner
of
the
DP
World
Tour
s
Race
to
Dubai

However
McIlroy
s
nearly
year
drought
in
the
four
majors
since
capturing
the
PGA
Championship
leaves
him
a
step
below
legends
such
as
Tiger
Woods
Jack
Nicklaus
Arnold
Palmer
and
others

Unless
of
course
McIlroy
still
has
a
few
more
victories
coming

If
longevity
were
not
a
factor
in

then
Ronaldinho
would
certainly
be
a
candidate
for
his
feats
in
his
first
three
years
with
Barcelona

Between
and
there
was
no
better
show
in
soccer

There
have
been
few
if
any
more
talented
players
in
the
history
of
the
global
game
and
all
too
briefly
Ronaldinho
captivated
with
his
childlike
glee
at
his
own
achievements
reminding
so
many
of
why
they
fell
in
love
with
the
sport
in
the
first
place

A
disappointing
World
Cup
was
a
turning
point
and
he
appeared
to
grow
weary
of
the
sacrifices
needed
to
stay
at
the
top
level

But
those
three
years
were
unforgettable

Methodology
Experts
in

asked
to
vote
to
rank
the
top
athletes
in
their
sport
since
Jan

no
accomplishments
before
this
date
were
to
be
considered


Those
votes
pared
down
pools
in
each

to
lists
of
to
athletes
each
which
constituted
the
overall
candidate
pool
for
the
top
athletes
of

was
presented
two
randomly
selected
names
and
asked
to
pick
which
one
has
had
the
better
career
in
the
st
century

Across
repeated
randomized
head

matchups
more
than
votes
were
cast
at
this
stage
and
using
an
Elo

system
the

then
evaluated
by
a

Jenna
Taylor
Bloody
Mary
repeated
three
times
in
the
mirror
the
tall
faceless
man
who
lurks
in
the
dark
the
story
of
a
man
waking
up
with
a
missing
kidney
urban
legends
have
always
been
whispered
to
us

From
a
young
age
we
have
been
told
stories
about
black
eyed
children
the
mysterious
call
received
by
a
babysitter
and
hundreds
of
other
stories
that
make
our
skin
crawl

Urban
legends
surround
us
and
they
can
be
anything
from
tales
told
on
the
school
bus
to
internet
stories

But
why
do
stories
like
this
spread
and
why
do
they
impact
us
so
much
The
term
urban
legend
has
been
popular
since
the
s
when
Jan
Harold
Brunvand
published
his
collection
of
urban
legends
and
their
meanings

When
discussing
the
story
of
the
vanishing
hitchhiker
Harold
wrote
that
the
legend
had
evolved
from
older
European
stories
about
travelers
riding
horseback

With
time
the
story
adopted
more
variations

With
changes
in
the
narrative
scenery
and
characters
the
story
has
traveled
far
and
wide
spreading
by
word
of
mouth
to
ears
all
around

Urban
legends
typically
grow
popular
through
storytelling

The
speaker
usually
claims
that
such
things
happened
to
a
friend
of
a
friend
making
the
story
something
we
want
to
believe

Because
why
would
a
friend
lie
The
peculiarities
and
suspense
of
an
urban
legend
are
what
makes
them
spread

The
more
shocking
yet
realistic
the
story
the
more
we
want
to
share
it

Sometimes
urban
legends
are
told
to
extend
caution
and
sometimes
most
times
they
are
simply
good
stories

Nowadays
instant
communication
has
made
it
easier
for
urban
legends
to
spread

For
a
long
time
urban
legend
email
chains
were
popular
and
now
such
tales
are
told
on
social
media
with
a
few
clicks

The
continuous
pattern
of
misinformation
circulating
on
social
media
has
made
it
easier
for
such
stories
to
be
shared
as
many
people
take
what
they
read
and
hear
on
the
internet
at
face
value
never
second
guessing
their
feeds

What
makes
urban
legends
so
captivating
is
that
they
contain
elements
from
everyday
life
such
as
walking
through
the
woods
driving
down
a
long
road
looking
into
a
mirror
the
list
is
endless

There
is
something
so
haunting
about
the
possibility
that
ordinary
things
could
expose
us
to
the
terrors
these
legends
speak
of

As
time
passes
urban
legends
shift
retelling
a
modernized
version
of
the
story
to
newer
audiences
making
urban
legends
everlasting

Some
stories
we
take
more
seriously
than
others
because
apart
from
entertainment
urban
legends
allow
us
to
spread
awareness
and
preach
caution
about
the
dangers
hidden
in
everyday
life

But
there
have
been
times
when
urban
legends
have
been
taken
too
seriously

In
two
girls
attempted
to
brutally
murder
their
best
friend
because
of
the
urban
legend
of
the
Slender
Man

The
first
time
the
name
touched
screens
was
in
when
two
faked
photos
and
ominous
captions
were
posted
about
the
Slender
Man
suggesting
that
because
of
this
evil
character
people
had
gone
missing

These
two
simple
posts
sparked
an
internet
phenomenon
birthing
lore
video
games
movies
and
more
about
the
mysterious
creature

People
began
to
believe
the
Slender
Man
was
real
and
that
he
was
a
danger
to
society
specifically
children

In
when
the
story
reached
year
olds
Anissa
Weier
and
Morgan
Geyser
it
forever
changed
many
lives

After
believing
that
the
Slender
Man
was
going
to
harm
her
family
Geyser
proposed
to
Weier
that
to
become
servants
or
proxies
to
Slender
Man
they
would
have
to
sacrifice
their
close
friend

After
plotting
the
two
young
girls
lured
their
year
old
friend
Payton
Leutner
into
the
woods
and
stabbed
her
times

Although
the
girls
were
caught
and
Leutner
survived
the
story
is
not
any
less
terrifying

It
is
important
to
be
cautious
when
spreading
stories
especially
among
children

Because
urban
legends
like
this
one
can
quickly
unfold
into
more
elaborate
creative
stories
our
minds
can
wander
into
dark
scary
places

Although
most
are
not
susceptible
to
becoming
violent
because
of
a
story
urban
legends
can
trigger
deep
dark
fears
impacting
us
deeply
and
oftentimes
making
us
paranoid

Most
people
have
been
impacted
by
urban
legends
in
one
way
or
another
whether
that
be
hearing
a
story
and
sharing
it
with
a
friend
or
stumbling
upon
a
Creepypasta
and
not
being
able
to
sleep
in
the
dark
for
days

Urban
legends
are
not
typical
scary
stories
they
are
spread
with
the
notion
that
they
are
true
and
that
they
are
something
we
should
beware
of

Urban
legends
must
be
spread
with
warning
as
they
can
unravel
more
than
we
know

Urban
legends
can
form
innocently
sometimes
with
the
simple
intention
of
amusing
friends
and
sometimes
with
the
intention
of
evoking
harmless
fear

But
as
humans
we
have
a
knack
for
taking
scary
stories
and
legends
too
seriously

Do
not
believe
everything
you
hear
and
remember
to
spread
stories
with
caution

You
never
know
what
you
could
be
stirring
up
in
someone
s
mind
or
how
easy
it
can
be
to
impact
a
person
s
life
forever

G

was
the
site
of
Stanley
Hall
where
a
bloody
massacre
took
place
years
prior

Early
in
the
movie
Natalie
Alicia
Witt
and
Brenda
Rebecca
Gayheart
talk
about
the
legend
of
the
Stanley
Hall
massacre
and
dare
one
another
to
stand
in
the
doorway
under
the
arch
on
the
east
side
of
the
building
and
repeat
the
words
Bloody
Mary
three
times

They
jump
when
they
hear
moaning
coming
up
from
the
boarded
up
door

Towards
the
end
of
the
film
Natalie
Alicia
Witt
hears
screaming
coming
from
Stanley
Hall
and
climbs
the
south
eastern
exterior
of
the
building

She
and
Paul
Jared
Leto
then
confront
Brenda
Rebecca
Gayheart
an
argument
which
results
in
Brenda
falling
out
the
second
floor
window

the
archway
of

Fun
Trivia
Urban
Legend
was
released
only
two
years
after
the
first
of
the
Scream
trilogy
films
and
received
much
negative
criticism
when
the
two
were
compared

Both
films
feature
a
well
known
group
of
young
actors
playing
a
small
group
of
friends
who
are
overly
familiar
with
the
horror
movie
genre
and
find
themselves
at
the
center
of
a
series
of
bizarre
murders

Like
its
counterpart
Urban
Legend
did
not
hesitate
to
poke
fun
at
itself
Just
prior
to
his
death
Damon
Joshua
Jackson

soundtrack

hit
TV
show
Dawson

Paul
Cole
s
I
Don
t
Want

Wait


At
the
end
of
the
film
a
group
of
students
sit
around
talking
about
the
murders
and
debate
whether
or
not
they
are
an
urban
legend

One
of
the
students
jokingly
says
that
they
bet
Brenda
was
the
girl
from
the
Noxzema
commercials
which
Rebecca
Gayheart
starred
in

When
Paul
Jared
Leto
and
Natalie
Alicia

What
exactly
is
the
difference
between
Mythology
Legend
Folklore
Epics
and
other
forms
of
literature
This
question
came
to
my

I
was
reading
The
Ravenous
Hyenas
and
the
Wounded
Sun
Myth
and
Ritual
in
Ancient
India
by
Stephanie
W

Jamison
where
she
defined
myth
for
the
purpose
of
her
work
as
a
narrative
that
involves
divine
or
semidivine
or
beyond
human
figures
as
major
participants
in
the
story

Is
this
accurate
Can
someone
answer
this
specific
query

the
more
general
one

Fascinating
Myths
in
Iceland
Landmannalaugar
in
the
Highlands
of
Iceland

A
Comprehensive
Guide
to
Icelandic
Folklore
Legends
In
a
realm
where
fiery
volcanoes
clash
with
icy
glaciers
and
the
Northern
Lights
illuminate
the
winter
sky
Iceland
is
a
place
where
the
boundaries
between
the
natural
and
the
supernatural
blur

This
remote
island
forged
by
the
raw
power
of
nature
is
steeped
in
legends
that
echo
with
the
whispers
of
ancient
gods
elusive
elves
and
fearsome
trolls

Here
the
winds
carry
folktales
of
hidden
worlds
beneath
the
earth
where
creatures
of
myths
and
legend
dwell

Join
us
as
we
delve
into
the
mystical
narratives
at
the
heart
of
this
Nordic
land

Lagarflj
tsormur
the
Icelandic
Loch
Ness
monster
Deep
in
the
waters
of
Lake
Lagarfljot
in
East
Iceland
lies
the
beast
Lagarflj
tsormur
the
Lagarfljot
worm
similar
to
Scotland
s
Loch
Ness
monster

Legend
has
it
that
a
young
girl
once
asked
her
mother
how
to
make
the
most
of
the
gold
ring
she
gave
her

The
mother
told
the
daughter
a
myth
according
to
which
gold
can
grow
on
a
worm

So
the
young
girl
trapped
a
worm
alongside
her
gold
ring
in
a
chest

But
alas
it
was
the
worm
that
grew
bigger
instead

Scared
she
threw
the
chest
into
the
lake
making
it
the
monster
s
home
for
eternity

The
legend
stems
from
the
eerie
atmosphere
around
the
lake

Of
late
its
existence
has
been
alluded
to
on
the
Internet
through
videos
showing
a
moving
form
in
Lake
Lagarfljot

home
to
big
stupid
and
greedy
trolls
a
prominent
character
in
Icelandic
folklore

Although
not
physically
appealing
trolls
can
perform
extraordinary
magical
feats
including
fearsome
spells
and
enchantments


As
they
aren
t
the
most
clever
beings
humans
can
easily
free
themselves
of
their
enchantments

That
being
said
trolls
have
a
taste
for
flesh
and
often
lure
unsuspecting
humans
including
misbehaving
children
into
their
caves
through
spells
potions
or
simply
by
capturing
them

The
Reynisdrangar
cliffs
three
towering
rocks
off
the
beach
of
Reynisfjara
V
k
M
rdal
are
a
testament
to
the
Icelandic
legend
of
trolls
turning
to
stone
in
the
sun

Hvitserkur
or
the
troll
rock
in
Iceland

The
lfh
l
Dollhouses
No
matter
where
you
find
yourself
in
Iceland
whether
amidst
the
bustle
of
a
lively
town
or
deep
within
the
enchanting
embrace
of
its
otherworldly
landscapes
you
are
likely
to
encounter
lfh
l

These
miniature
wooden
dwellings
lovingly
crafted
by
human
hands
stand
as
humble
abodes
for
the
elves
who
are
believed
to
inhabit
them

lfh
l
dollhouses
can
range
from
the
simplest
to
the
most
elaborate
and
include
minute
churches
created
to
convert
the
elves
to
Christianity

Hulduf
lk
the
Elves
of
Iceland
North
European
and
Germanic
mythology
refer
to
elves
as
beautiful
subtle
eternal
beings
having
extraordinary
magical
power

In
Iceland
elves
are
called
Hulduf
lk
hidden
people
as
they
live
in
enchanted
rocks
and
cliffs

Their
resemblance
to
humans
and
their
lifestyle
is
remarkably
uncanny
and
believed
to
be
why
they
are
invisible
most
of
the
time
except
for
occasions
like
Midsummer
Night
and
New
Year
s
Eve

Icelandic
elves
are
fiercely
protective
of
their
enchanted
homes
and
are
known
to
unleash
great
harm
on
those
who
disturb
them

The
latest
manifestation
of
this
myth
occurred
during
a
road
laying
project
at
the
G
lgahraun
lava
field
in


Mysterious
breakdowns
and
strange
accidents
plagued
the
project
until
at
last
the
road
was
rerouted
to
bypass
the
hidden
people
s
realm
leaving
their
secrets
undisturbed

Iceland
s
Yule
Lads
In
Iceland
the
holiday
season
doesn
t
start
until
Yule
Lads
or
rather
the
first
of
these
thirteen
mischievous
creatures
have
made
their
appearance

These
thirteen
brothers
who
trace
their
lineage
back
to
trolls
inhabit
the
pitch
black
caves
within
the
mountains
sharing
their
home
with
their
ogre
parents
Gr
la
and
Leppal
i
and
the
child
eating
Yule
Cat

Their
tradition
of
creating
mischief
in
rural
communities
led
them
to
be
called
names
such
as
The
Door
Slammer
and
Candle
Stealer


Today
these
Yule
Lads
have
taken
on
a
new
role
as
the
Icelandic
version
of
Santa
Claus

The
Legend
of
Dimmuborgir
Around
years
ago
an
eruption
in
the
Lake
M
vatn
region
of
northern
Iceland
created
lava
column
sculptures
at
Dimmuborgir

Translated
to
dark
castle
in
English
Dimmuborgir
has
been
described
as
the
gateway
to
Hell
in
Nordic
legends

Gr
la
and
Leppal
i
the
troll
parents
of
the
Icelandic
Yule
Lads
are
known
to
kidnap
little
children
and
bring
them
here
during
Christmas
time

The
place
also
has
references
in
pop
culture
most
notably
the
Norwegian
dark
metal
band
Dimmu
Borgir

The
lava
from
the
eruption
that
created
Dimmuborgir
can
also
be
seen
in
nearby
volcanic
areas
such
as
N
maskar
Pass
Grj
tagj
cave
and
Krafla
fissure

Lagarfljot
Lake
near
the
Litlanesfoss
waterfall
in
Iceland

As
the
mist
settles
over
Iceland
s
rugged
landscapes
the
tales
of
ancient
beings
hidden
worlds
and
timeless
magic
linger
in
the
air
leaving
an
indelible
mark
on
the
soul

Anyone
remember
this
show
I
was
surprised
to
discover
this
it
s
been
almost
years
since
this
show
has
aired
on
disney
and
it
gave
me
nostalgia
vibes
after
watching
a
few
episodes

What
s
sad
is
that
the
show
is
pretty
much
forgotten
there
are
only
a
few
episodes
on
both
vimeo
and
youtube
so
some
of
it
is

I
remember
this
show
looked
forward
to
see
the
episode
on
the
durian
which
is
nowhere
to
be
found
online
now

Want
to
write
to
Disney
Channel
Asia
requesting
them
to
put
up
the
episodes
on
its
YouTube
channel
but
I
do
not
know
how
I
would
phrase
it

Here
are
other
episodes
available
online
Taro
Japan
Why
Man
and
Animal
Don
t
Live
Together
Hmong
The
uploader
of
the
Western
Australia
and
Hmong
episodes
Allan
Lau
did
the
music
scoring
for
those
episodes

Probably
he
has
more
if
he
did
the
score
for
the
entire
show

There
is
a
similar
show
by
Disney
Channel
Asia
from
a
few
years
after
this
show
called
Guardians

Each
episodes
featured
a
festival
from
an
Asian
country
with
an
elder
narrating
the
story
and
a
child
participating
in
the
festival

In
the
Philippines
it
was
the
Higantes
that
was
featured

Guardians
is
totally
lost
media
with
no
episodes
online

Or
perhaps
I
did
not
find
hard
enough
If
anyone
wants
to
write
an
article
on
this
on
the
wiki
Legends

the

I
just
found
two
articles
on
this
show

One
by
Magz
Osborne
on
Variety
com
the
other
is
from
Animated
Views

According
to
the
latter
six
shorts
were
made

I
thought
there
were
more

The
latter
article
also
contained
a
link
to
the
show
s
website

It
s
no
longer
up
but
the
Wayback
Machine
was
able
to
save
it

It
s
all
in
Flash

But
everything
can
be
saved
from
the
site
by
a
simple
print
screen

I
saved
screencaps

Was
looking
for
info
about
the
Philippine
episode
when
I
found
names
of
people
involved
with
the
show

From
a
Philstar
com
a
Philippine
news
site
article
from
August
Walt
Disney
Television
International
Asia
Pacific
WDTVI
AP
received
two
World
Gold
PROMAX
Awards
for
Disney
s
Legends
of
the
Ring
of
Fire
the
first
animated
short
story
series
produced
by
Walt
Disney
Television

Indonesia
s
folktale
Why
the
Sun
Chases
the
Moon
bagged
the
Gold
in
the
category
interstitial
promotainment
Network
or
Block
executive
produced
by
Raymund
Miranda
and
Ashok
Miranda

The
other
Gold
was
for
Malaysia
s
folktale
The
Chengal
Tree
executive
produced
by
Raymund
Miranda
Shawn
Letts
Kelvin
Singh
and
Ashok
Miranda

Legends
of
the
Ring
of
Fire
recounts
stories
from
Asian
folklore
passed
down
from
generation
to
generation

Combining
high
quality
animation
and
memorable
soundtracks
with
the
magic
of
Disney
s
unique
storytelling
style
the
series
captures
the
hearts
and
imagination
of
the
young
and
old

It
features
classic
folktales
from
India
Indonesia
Singapore
Taiwan
Malaysia
Korea
Thailand
and
the
Philippines

WDTVI
AP
s
creative
services
team
headed
by
executive
producer
Natalie
Gee
also
won
a
Silver
PROMAX
Award
for
Promotional
Animation
for
the
Studio
D
opener
and
a
Silver
BDA
Design
Award
for
Interstitial
for
Behind
the
Ears
Lilo
Stitch
Something
Stitch

Both
were
produced
by
Senior
Graphics
Producer
Juddee
Torres

We
are
extremely
pleased
and
honored
to
be
presented
with
these
awards
says
Miranda
who
is
also
the
managing
director

These
awards
are
a
fitting
validation
of
all
the
hard
work
and
talent
that
go
through
the
creation
of
each
Disney
program

We
re
especially
proud
of
Disney
s
Legends
of
the
Ring
of
Fire
as
we
feel
that
it
perfectly
showcases
Asia
s
diverse
colorful
and
historic
cultures
and
traditions
adds
Miranda

I
found
another
article
on
Miranda
from
the
same
site
and
his
LinkedIn
profile

He
s
an
executive
at
ABS
CBN
which
is
facing
challenging
times
right
now

Hence
maybe
now
is
not
the
best
time
to
contact
him

I
also
found
this
forum
post
describing
all
episodes

It
cites
a
now
deleted
forum
post
at
talkdisney
com

The
post
is
available
at
the
Wayback
Machine
and
cites
The
Jakarta
Post

August
Source
The
Jakarta
Post


I
cannot
find
The
Jakarta
Post
article
but
it
is
reproduced
in
jawawa
id
which
I
don
t
know
anything
about

If
there
are
Indonesians
here
please
help

Hence
these
descriptions
remain
unverified

In
the
beginning
there
were
nine
suns
scorching
the
Earth

The
Moon
felt
sorry
for
the
people
of
Earth
and
helped
them
trick
the
father
Sun
into
eating
the
other
suns

This
is
the
story
of
Why
the
Sun
Chases
the
Moon
based
on
Indonesian
folklore
for
the
Disney
Channel
series
Legends
of
the
Ring
of
Fire

The
Cengal
Tree
a
tale
from
Malaysia
Premiere
date
Saturday
Aug

Long
long
ago
it
rained
non
stop
such
that
the
earth
was
flooded

The
white
ants
had
to
flee
from
their
homes
to
escape
the
floodwaters

They
appealed
to
the
trees
to
seek
shelter
in
their
branches
but
were
refused
as
the
trees
were
afraid
that
the
white
ants
would
eat
them
later

Finally
they
approached
the
big
Cengal
tree
as
their
last
hope
and
the
Cengal
tree
who
had
a
soft
heart
agreed
and
struck
a
bargain
with
the
white
ants
which
lasts
till
this
day

How
the
Moon
Came
to
be
a
tale
from
Thailand
Premiere
date
Saturday
Sept

Long
long
ago
there
was
a
Sun
King
who
ruled
the
heavens
but
there
was
no
moon
in
the
sky
at
night

One
day
the
Sun
King
say
the
beautiful
daughter
of
the
King
of
Siam
and
fell
in
love
with
her

He
refused
to
go
back
to
his
home
in
the
sky
as
he
wanted
to
stay
by
her
side
constantly
and
night
never
fell
on
earth
again

The
stars
who
were
forced
to
hide
in
the
clouds
decided
on
a
plan
to
bring
back
the
nights
and
in
doing
so
created
the
moon
that
we
see
in
our
skies
to
this
day

How
Singapore
Got
Its
Name
a
tale
from
Singapore
Premiere
date
Saturday
Sept

Long
long
ago
there
was
a
young
adventurous
king
who
loved
to
hunt

One
day
when
he
was
in
the
jungle
hunting
for
stags
he
came
a
cross
a
beautiful
island

Eager
to
explore
it
he
set
sail
immediately
and
encountered
the
fury
of
the
Sea
King

Upon
landing
safely
on
the
island
a
majestic
lion
like
creature
appeared
from
the
jungle
and
gave
the
king
the
inspiration
to
name
the
island
Singapore
which
it
is
still
known
as
to
this
day

The
Magic
Snail
a
tale
from
Korea
Premiere
date
Saturday
Oct

There
once
was
a
young
hardworking
farmer
who
longed
for
a
wife
and
made
a
wish
while
working
in
his
fields

He
heard
a
reply
come
from
a
snail
and
took
the
snail
home
out
of
curiosity

The
snail
transformed
into
a
beautiful
lady
whom
the
farmer
fell
in
love
with
and
they
were
married

One
day
by
chance
the
king
saw
the
beautiful
snail
lady
and
wanted
her
for
himself
so
he
challenged
the
farmer
to
a
test

But
with
the
help
of
his
beautiful
wife
and
the
Dragon
King
the
farmer
was
able
to
overcome
all
obstacles
and
win
back
his
wife

How
the
Durian
Came
to
Be
a
tale
from
the
Philippines
Premiere
date
Saturday
Oct

Long
long
ago
a
powerful
king
ruled
the
Kingdom
of
the
Philippines
but
he
was
sad
as
he
had
a
beautiful
young
wife
who
did
not
love
him

He
decided
to
seek
help
from
a
wise
hermit
who
told
him
how
to
win
his
wife
s
heart
by
planting
a
special
tree

He
succeeded
with
the
help
of
the
nymph
of
the
air
and
held
a
celebration
for
the
entire
kingdom
but
he
forgot
to
invite
the
wise
hermit

In
a
rage
the
hermit
cursed
the
tree
and
created
the
fruit
we
know
as
durian
to
this
day

Based
on
these
descriptions
there
are
still
four
missing
episodes
the
tales
from
Malaysia
Singapore
Korea
and
the
Philippines

Meanwhile
among
the
found
episodes
are
from
Western
Australia
and
Japan

This
means
that
there
are
more
than
six
episodes

Which
means
that
I
was
correct
when
I
said
see
post
above
According
to
the
latter
six
shorts
were
made

I
thought
there
were
more

The
possibility
of
more
episodes
is
not
a
Mandela
effect

How
many
exactly
were
made
I
plan
to
ask
Mr

Miranda
when
the
time
is
right

production
or
simply
didn
t
win
an
award
I
don
t
know

So
there
are
six
initial
episodes
plus
the
Western
Australia
and
Japan
episodes
plus
the
Hmong
episode
which
I
forgot
to
mention
in
my
last
post
plus
the
four
episodes
I
mentioned
in
this
post
for
a
grand
total
of

I
had
never
of
heard
of
this
show
but
the
few
episodes
that
are
availble
seem
great

Haven
t
located
any
other
episodes
but
found
some
additional
links
info

This
forum
thread
that
has
some
assorted
concept
art
including
a
shot
from
The
Magic
Snail
as
well
as
a
link
to
a
now
dead
and
not
waybacked
page
that
stated
the
series
had
a
total
of
eps
so
good
calulation
phlmhunter


IMDB
seeems
to
have
a
stub
article
for
The
Herdsman
and
the
Weaver
that
does
not
associated
it
with
the
larger
series

Of
the
three
names
included
only
writer
Polly
Watkins
has
credits
apart
from
the
short

Another
trail
I
have
found
that
is
already
a
dead
end
is
the
actor
who
voiced
the
narrator
Jim
West
who
passed
away
in
https
voiceactors
wordpress
com
tag
james
robert
west
and
voice

com
jimwest
although
strangely
the
first
link
mentions
an
Emmy
for
the
voice
over
perfomance
that
I
can
t
find
any
proof
of

However
it
appears
he
also
recieved
a
Promax
award

The
only
two
other
major
names
I
have
come
accross
is
the
director
of
Why
the
Sun
Chases
the
Moon
and
the
series
producer
Atul
N
Rao

Another
link
for
Rao
mention
that
he
wrote
and
directed
for
the
series
as
well

A
few
other
minor
players
two
animators
and
an
audio
enginer
include
the
show
in
their
resumes
bios
availble
online
Again
not
sure
if
any
of
this
will
help
but
just
wanted
to
share
what
I
have
found

You
know
this
series
is
obscure
when
googling
Disney
Legends
of
the
Ring
of
Fire
only
has
results
with
the
ommited
simlar
results
active

Thank
you
for
the
additional
info
Amdillae

I
m
hoping
that
they
have
copies
of
the
episodes
they
worked
on
and
that
they
would
be
willing
to
make
them
available
online

If
not
then
at
least
we
can
ask
them
about
their
experiences
in
working
on
the
show

I
ll
contact
them
in
the
far
future
when
I
start
making
my
script
for
this
show
on
my
YouTube
channel

Please
check
it
out

But
if
you
or
someone
else
wants
to
reach
out
to
them
now
feel
free
to
do
so

Thanks
again

Goodbye

Looks

the

is
an

From
Staff
Writer
with
agencies
Taiwan
Quick
Take
Taipei
Times
July
Saisiat
tale
now
a
cartoon
The
Disney
Channel
will
be
airing
a
five
minute
cartoon
based
on
local
indigenous
folklore
on
Saturday
and
Sunday
at
pm

The
cartoon
The
Lightening
Spirit
s
Daughter
A
Tale
from
Taiwan
is
based
on
a
Saisiat
legend
describing
how
the
Saisiat
people
who
live
in
Miaoli
and
Hsinchu
counties
became
farmers

According
to
the
legend
the
Saisiat
were
hunters

The
lightening
god
saddened
by
the
land
being
left
to
waste
sent
his
daughter
to
the
Earth
where
she
married
a
Saisiat
man
and
taught
the
people
how
to
farm

Although
she
eventually
returned
to
the
heavens
the
Saisiat
honor
her
memory
by
holding
ceremonies
each
year

Disney
is
showing
the
cartoon
as
part
of
its
cartoon
series
Legends
of
the
Ring
of
Fire
which
details
myths
from
Southeast
and
Northeast
Asia

rehearsed
ready
to
punish
any
mistakes

Joe
acknowledged
that
he
regularly
whipped
Michael

Katherine
said
that
although
whipping
came
to
be
considered
abuse
it
was
a
common
way
to
discipline
children
when
Michael
was
growing
up

Jackie
Tito
Jermaine
and
Marlon
denied
that
their
father
was
abusive
and
said
that
the
whippings
which
had
a
deeper
impact
on
Michael
because
he
was
younger
kept
them
disciplined
and
out
of
trouble

Michael
said
that
during
his
youth
he
was
lonely
and
isolated

Later

After
signing
with
Motown
the
Jackson
family
relocated
to
Los
Angeles

In
Motown
executives
decided
Diana
Ross
should
introduce
the
Jackson
to
the
public
partly
to
bolster
her
career
in
television
sending
off
what
was
considered
Motown
s
last
product
of

line

described
as
a
cutting
edge
example
of
black
crossover
artists

were
frustrated
by

losing
their
pigment

He
also
identified
discoid
lupus
erythematosus
in
Jackson

He
diagnosed
Jackson
with
lupus
that
year
and
with
vitiligo
in


Vitiligo
s
drastic
effects
on
the
body
can
cause
psychological
distress

Jackson
used
fair
colored
makeup
and
possibly
skin
bleaching
prescription
creams
to
cover
up
the
uneven
blotches
of
color
caused
by
the
illness

The
creams
would
depigment
the
blotches
and
with
the
application
of
makeup
he
could
appear
very
pale

Jackson
said
he
had
not
purposely
bleached
his
skin
and
could
not
control
his
vitiligo
adding
When
people
make
up
stories
that
I
don
t
want
to
be
who
I
am
it
hurts
me

He
became
friends
with
Klein
and
Klein
s
assistant
Debbie
Rowe

Rowe
later
became
Jackson
s
second
wife
and
the
mother
of
his
first
two
children

In
his
autobiography
and
a
interview
Jackson
said
he
had
had
two
rhinoplasty
surgeries
and
a
cleft
chin
surgery
but
no
more
than
that

He
said
he
lost
weight
in
the
early
s
because
of
a
change
in
diet
to
achieve
a
dancer
s
body

Witnesses
reported
that
he
was
often
dizzy
and
speculated
he
was
suffering
from
anorexia
nervosa

Periods
of
weight
loss
became
a
recurring
problem
later
in
his
life

After
his
death
Jackson
s
mother
said
that
he
first
turned
to
cosmetic
procedures
to
remedy
his
vitiligo
because
he
did
not
want
to
look
like
a
spotted
cow


She
said
he
had
received
more
than
the
two
cosmetic
surgeries
he
claimed
and
speculated
that
he
had
become
addicted
to
them

In
it
was
reported
that
Jackson
slept
in
a
hyperbaric
oxygen
chamber
to
slow
aging

He
denied
the
story
although
it
was
alleged
that
Jackson
leaked
an
image
of
him
sleeping
in
a
glass
chamber
according
to
Jackson
this
was
a
promotional
shot
from
an
upcoming
space
opera
featuring
himself
to
The
National
Enquirer

It
was
also
reported
that
Jackson
took
female
hormone
shots
to
keep
his
voice
high
and
facial
hair
wispy
proposed
to
Elizabeth
Taylor
and
possibly
had
a
shrine
of
her
and
had
cosmetic
surgery
on
his
eyes

Jackson
s
manager
Frank
DiLeo
denied
all
of
them
except
for
Jackson
having
a
chamber

DiLeo
added
I
don
t
know
if
he
sleeps
in
it

I
m
not
for
it

But
Michael
thinks
it
s
something
that
s
probably
healthy
for
him

He
s
a
bit
of
a
health
fanatic

When
Jackson
took
his
pet
chimpanzee
Bubbles
to
tour
in
Japan
the
media
portrayed
Jackson
as
an
aspiring
Disney
cartoon
character
who
befriended
animals

It
was
also
reported
that
Jackson
had
offered
to
buy
the
bones
of
Joseph
Merrick
the
Elephant
Man


In
June
the
Chicago
Tribune
reported
Jackson
s
publicist
bidding
million
for
the
skeleton
to
the
London
Hospital
Medical
College
on
his
behalf

The
college
maintained
the
skeleton
was
not
for
sale

DiLeo
said
Jackson
had
an
absorbing
interest
in
Merrick
purely
based
on
his
awareness
of
the
ethical
medical
and
historical
significance

In
September
using
the
oxygen
chamber
story
the
British
tabloid
The
Sun
branded
Jackson
Wacko
Jacko
a
name
Jackson
came
to
despise

The
Atlantic
noted
that
the
name
Jacko
has
racist
connotations
as
it
originates
from
Jacko
Macacco
a
monkey
used
in
monkey
baiting
matches
at
the
Westminster
Pit
in
the
early
s
and
Jacko
was
used
in
Cockney
slang
to
refer
to
monkeys
in
general

Jackson
worked
with
George
Lucas
and
Francis
Ford
Coppola
on
the
minute
million
D
film
Captain
EO
which
ran
from

Disneyland
and
Epcot

later
at
Tokyo
Disneyland

been
removed
in
the
late
s
it
returned
to
the
theme
park
for
several
years
after
Jackson
s
death

In
Ebony
reported
that
Jackson
had
disassociated
himself
from
the
Jehovah
s
Witnesses

Katherine
Jackson
said
this
might
have
been
because
some
Witnesses
strongly
opposed
the
Thriller
video
which
Michael
denounced
in
a
Witness
publication
in


In
Jackson
told
an
interviewer
he

First

Main

Michael
Jackson
sexual
abuse
allegations
In
August
Jackson
was
accused
of
child
sexual
abuse
by
a
year
old
boy
Jordan
Chandler
and
his
father
Evan
Chandler

Jordan
said
he
and
Jackson
had
engaged
in
acts
of
kissing
masturbation
and
oral
sex

While
Jordan
s
mother
initially
told
police
that
she
did
not
believe
Jackson
had
molested
him
her
position
wavered
a
few
days
later

Evan
was
recorded
discussing
his
intention
to
pursue
charges
which
Jackson
used
to
argue
that
he
was
the
victim
of
a
jealous
father
trying
to
extort
money

Jackson
s
older
sister
La
Toya
accused
him
of
being
a
pedophile
she
later
retracted
this
saying
she
had
been
forced
into
it
by
her
abusive
husband

Police
raided
Jackson
s
home
in
August
and
found
two
legal
large
format
art
books
featuring
young
boys
playing
running
and
swimming
in
various
states
of
undress

Jackson
denied
knowing
of
the
books
content
and
claimed
if
they
were
there
someone
had
to
have
sent
them
to
him
and
he
did
not
open
them

Jordan
Chandler
gave
police
a
description
of
Jackson
s
genitals

A
strip
search
was
made
and
the
jurors
felt
the
description
was
not
a
match

In
January
Jackson
settled
with
the
Chandlers
out
of
court
for
a
reported
total
sum
of
million

The
police
never
pressed
criminal
charges

Citing
a
lack
of
evidence
without
Jordan
s
testimony
the
state
closed
its
investigation
on
September


Jackson
had
been
taking
painkillers
for
his
reconstructive
scalp
surgeries
administered
due
to
the
Pepsi
commercial
accident
in
and
became
dependent
on
them
to
cope
with
the
stress
of
the
sexual
abuse
allegations

On
November
Jackson
canceled
the
remainder
of
the
Dangerous
World
Tour
due
to
health
problems
stress
from
the
allegations
and
painkiller
addiction

He
thanked
his
close
friend
Elizabeth
Taylor
for
support
encouragement
and
counsel

The
end
of
the
tour
concluded
his
sponsorship
deal
with
Pepsi

In
late
Jackson
proposed
to
Lisa
Marie
Presley
the
daughter
of
Elvis
Presley
over
the
phone

They
were
married
in
La
Vega
Dominican
Republic
in
May
by
civil
judge
Hugo
Francisco
lvarez
P
rez

The
tabloid
media
speculated
that
the
wedding
was
a
publicity
stunt
to
deflect
away
from
Jackson
s
sexual
abuse
allegations
and
jump
start
Presley
s
career
as
a
singer

Their
marriage
ended
little
more
than
a
year
later
and
they
separated
in
December


Presley
cited
irreconcilable
differences
when
filing
for
divorce
the
next
month
and
only
sought
to
reclaim
her
maiden
name
as
her
settlement

After
the
divorce
Judge
P
rez
said
They
lasted
longer
than
I
thought
they
would

I
gave
them
a
year

They
lasted
a
year
and
a
half

Presley
later
said
she
and
Jackson
had
attempted
to
reconcile
intermittently
for
four
years
following
their
divorce
and
that
she
had
traveled
the
world
to
be
with
him

Jackson
composed
music
for
the
Sega
Genesis
video
game
Sonic
the
Hedgehog
but
left
the
project
around
the
time
the
sexual
abuse
allegations
surfaced
and
went
uncredited

The
Sega
Technical
Institute
director
Roger
Hector
and
the
Sonic
co
creator
Naoto
Ohshima
said
that
Jackson
s
involvement
was
terminated
and
his
music
reworked
following
the
allegations

However
Jackson
s
musical
director
Brad
Buxer
and
other
members
of
Jackson
s
team
said
Jackson
went
uncredited
because
he
was
unhappy
with
how
the
Genesis
replicated
his
music

The

preceded
by
a
dispute
between

record
label

Entertainment

Jackson
had
expected

to
him
in
the
early
s
after
which
he
would
be

however
he
pleased
and
keep
the
profits
but
clauses
in
the
contract
set
the
revert
date
years
into
the
future

Jackson
sought
an
early
exit
from
his
contract

Invincible
was
released
on
October


It
was

first
full

album
in
six

II
nicknamed
Blanket
nb

over
the
railing
of
his
Berlin
hotel
room

criticism
in

Jackson
apologized

calling
it
a
terrible
mistake

Avram
filed
a
breach
of
contract
complaint
against

to
pay

appeals
on
the
verdict
and
settled
the
lawsuit
for
an
undisclosed
amount

final
on

at
Al
Sharpton
s
National
Action
Network
in
Harlem
Jackson
called
the
Sony
Music
chairman
Tommy
Mottola
a
racist
and
very
very
very
devilish
and
accused
him
of
exploiting
black
artists
for
his
own
gain

The
accusation
prompted
Sharpton
to
form
a
coalition
investigating
whether
Mottola
exploited
black
artists

Jackson
charged
that
Mottola
had
called
his
colleague
Irv
Gotti
a
fat
nigger


Sony
issued
a
statement
calling
the
accusations
ludicrous
spiteful
and
hurtful
and
said
Mottola
had
championed
Jackson
s
career
for
years

Sony
refused
to
renew
Jackson
s
contract
and
said
that
a
million
promotional
campaign
had
failed
because

he
saw
nothing
wrong
with
having
sleepovers
with
minors
and
sharing
his
bed
and
bedroom
with
various
people
which
aroused
controversy

He
insisted
that
the
sleepovers
were
not
sexual
and
that
his
words
had
been
misunderstood

old

case
was
filed
by
James
Safechuck
alleging
similar
sexual
abuse
over
a
four
year
period
starting
when
Safechuck
was
ten


Both
had
previously
testified
in
Jackson
s
defense
during
the
allegations
Robson
did
so
again
in


In
Robson
s
case
against
Jackson
s
estate
was
dismissed
as
it
had
been
filed
too
late

Safechuck
s
claim
was
also
time
barred

In

ruled
that
Jackson
s
corporations

his
alleged
past
actions

appealed

On

Safechuck

nor
was
it

relationship
between

results


On
February
the
Jackson
estate
sued
HBO
for
breaching
a
non
disparagement
clause
from
a
contract

HBO
to
participate
in
a
non

arbitration
that
could

awarded
to

not
breach
a
contract
and
filed
an
anti
SLAPP
motion
against
the
estate

In
September
Judge
George
H

Wu
denied
HBO
s
motion
to
dismiss
the
case
allowing
the
Jackson
estate
to
arbitrate

HBO
appealed
but
in
December
the
appeals
court
affirmed
Wu
s
ruling

In

state
law
passed
in
California
which
granted
plaintiffs
in
child
sex
abuse
cases
an
additional
period
to
file
lawsuits

List
of
Michael
Jackson
records
and
achievements
Jackson
has
been
referred
to
as
the
King
of
Pop
for
having
transformed
the
art
of
music
videos
and
paving
the
way
for
modern
pop
music

For
much
of
Jackson
s
career
he
had
an
unparalleled
worldwide
influence
over
the
younger
generation

His
influence
extended
beyond
the
music
industry
he
impacted
dance
led
fashion
trends
and
raised
awareness
for
global
affairs

Jackson
s
music
and
videos
fostered
racial
diversity
in
MTV
s
roster
and
steered
its
focus
from
rock
to
pop
music
and
R
B
leading
to
the
discontinuation
of
the
album
oriented
rock
format
previously
dominant
on
the
channel

Michael
Jackson
s
meteoric
rise
in
the
s
catapulted
him
to
global
stardom
and
his
influence
transcended
borders

In
Africa
his
influence
was
compared
to
Nelson
Mandela
for
his
ability
to
inspire
and
unite
diverse
audiences
through
his
music

Similarly
in
India
Jackson
was
likened
to
Mahatma
Gandhi
with
his
art
championing
themes
of
social
justice
and
humanitarianism
and
his
influence
extending
to
Bollywood
where
it
was
said
that
anyone
who
danced
well
was
compared
to
Michael
Jackson

In
Europe
Jackson
s
impact
was
compared
to
that
of
the
Pope
drawing
huge
crowds
of
people
who
gathered
to
see
the
singer
in
public
and
even
more
to
his
concerts
which
spread
messages
of
love
and
healing
during
rough
economic
and
political
times

His
presence
in
the
Middle
East
was
considered
as
widespread
as
Coca
Cola
symbolizing
a
shared
global
culture
through
his
music

Additionally
Jackson
is
considered
the
backbone
of
the
K
Pop
industry
in
South
Korea
influencing
countless
artists
and
shaping
the
genre
s
development

In
songs
such
as
Black
or
White
Heal
the
World
Earth
Song
and
They
Don
t
Care
About
Us
Jackson
s
music
emphasized
racial
integration
and
environmentalism
and
protested
injustice

He
is
recognized
as
the
Most
Successful
Entertainer
of
All
Time
by
Guinness
World
Records

Jackson
has
also
appeared
on
Rolling
Stone
s
lists
of
the
Greatest
Singers
of
All
Time

He
is
considered
one
of
the
most
significant
cultural
figures
of
the
th
century
and
his
contributions
to
music
dance
and
fashion
along
with
his
publicized
personal
life
made
him
a
global
figure
in
popular
culture
for
over
four
decades

Trying
to
trace
Michael
Jackson
s
influence
on
the
pop
stars
that
followed
him
is
like
trying
to
trace
the
influence
of
oxygen
and
gravity

So
vast
far
reaching
and
was
his
impact
particularly
in
the
wake
of
Thriller
s
colossal
and
heretofore
unmatched
commercial
success
that
there
weren
t
a
whole
lot
of
artists
who
weren

trying
to
mimic
some
of
the
Jackson
formula

league
of

of
alcohol
and

a
prolific
philanthropist
and
humanitarian

Jackson
s
early
charitable
work
has
been
described
by
The
Chronicle
of
Philanthropy
as
having
paved
the
way
for
the
current
surge
in
celebrity

and
by
the

Angeles
Times
as
having
set
the
standard
for
generosity

other
entertainers


By
some
estimates
he
donated
over
million
not
accounting
for
inflation
to
various
charities
over
the
course
of
his
life

In
Jackson
established
his
Heal
the
World
Foundation
to
which
he
donated
several
million
dollars
in
revenue
from
his
Dangerous
World

Jackson
s
philanthropic
activities
went
beyond
just
monetary
donations

He
also
performed
at
benefit
concerts
some
of
which
he
arranged

He
gifted
tickets
for
his
regular
concert
performances
to
groups
that

charity
auctions

He
received
various
awards
and
accolades
for
his
philanthropic
work
including
two
bestowed
by
presidents
of
the
United
States

The
vast
breadth
of
Jackson
s
philanthropic
work
has
earned
recognition
in
the
Guinness
World
Records

On
May
President
Ronald
Reagan
gave
Jackson
an
award
recognizing
his
support
of
alcohol
and
drug
abuse
charities
and
in
recognition
of
his
support
for
the
Ad
Council
s
and
the
National
Highway
Traffic
Safety
Administration
s

campaign

Jackson
allowed
the
campaign
to
use
Beat

for
its
public
service
announcements

Artistry
Vocal
style
Jackson
was
known
as
an
expressive
vocalist
with
absolute
pitch

Critics
describe
his
vocal
theatricality
having
a
range
from
clear
and
soft
to
harsh
and
aggressive
depending
on
the
genre
sung

Principally
in
history
Michael
Jackson
is
the
sole
recipient
to
receive
Grammy
Awards
for
three
different
genres
of
vocal
performance
as
a
soloist
winning
Pop
Vocal
for
Thriller
Rock
Vocal
for
Beat
It
and
Rhythm
and
Blues
Vocal
with
both
Billie
Jean
and
Don
t
Stop
Til
You
Get
Enough


Bruce
Swedien
his
long
time
sound
engineer
emphasized
that
a
critical
element
of
their
vocal
recordings
are
of
him
and
Jackson
trying
numerous
approaches
to
rhythmic
emotional
and
technical
distinctions
to
consummate
a
sonic
character


His
stylings
such
as
common
use
of
staccato
legato
falsetto
as
well
as
vocal
hiccups
adlibs
wailings
and
growls
are
all
signature
to
his
sound

Jackson
sang
from
childhood
and
over
time
his
voice
and
vocal
style
changed

Between
and
his
voice
descended
from
boy
soprano
to
lyric
tenor

He
was
known
for
his
intonation
and
vocal
range

Through
each
music
release
his
vocal
development
and
changes
were
positively
narrated
by
music
journalists

With
the
arrival
of
Off
the
Wall
in
the
late
s
Jackson
s
abilities
in
his
coming
of
age
period
had
Rolling
Stone
comparing
his
vocals
to
the
breathless
dreamy
stutter
of
Stevie
Wonder
and
wrote
that
Jackson
s
feathery
timbred
tenor
is
extraordinarily
beautiful

It
slides
smoothly
into
a
startling
falsetto
that
s
used
very
daringly

By
the
time
of
s
Thriller
Rolling
Stone
wrote
that
Jackson
was
singing
in
a
fully
adult
voice
that
was
tinged
by
sadness


The
turn
of
the
s
saw
the
release
of
the
introspective
album
Dangerous

The
New
York
Times
noted
that
on
some
tracks
he
gulps
for
breath
his
voice
quivers
with
anxiety
or
drops
to
a
desperate
whisper
hissing
through
clenched
teeth
and
he
had
a
wretched
tone


When
singing
of
brotherhood
or
self
esteem
the
musician
would
return
to
smooth
vocals

Of
Invincible
Rolling
Stone
wrote
that
at
Jackson
still
performed
exquisitely
voiced
rhythm
tracks
and
vibrating
vocal
harmonies


Joseph
Vogel
notes
Jackson
s
ability
to
use
non
verbal
sounds
to
express
emotion

Neil
McCormick
wrote
that
Jackson
s
unorthodox
singing
style
was
original
and
utterly
distinctive


Influences
Jackson
was
influenced
by
musicians
including
James
Brown
Little
Richard
Jackie
Wilson
Diana
Ross
Fred
Astaire
Sammy
Davis
Jr

Gene
Kelly
and
David
Ruffin

Little
Richard
had
a
substantial
influence
on
Jackson
but
Brown
was
his
greatest
inspiration

When
Jackson
was
a
small
child
his
mother
would
wake
him
whenever
Brown
appeared
on
television

Jackson
described
being
mesmerized


Jackson
s
vocal
technique
was
influenced
by
Diana
Ross
his
use
of
the
oooh
interjection
from
a
young
age
was
something
Ross
had
used
on
many
of
her
songs
with
the
Supremes

She
was
a
mother
figure
to
him
and
he
often
watched
her
rehearse

He
said
he
had
learned
a
lot
from
watching
how
she
moved
and
sang
and
that
she
had
encouraged
him
to
have
confidence
in
himself

Choreographer
David
Winters
who
met
Jackson
while
choreographing
the
Diana
Ross
TV
special
Diana
said
that
Jackson
watched
the
musical
West
Side
Story
almost
every
week
and
it
was
his
favorite
film
he
paid
tribute
to
it
in
Beat
It
and
the
Bad
video

Musicianship
Jackson
had
no
formal
music
training
and
could
not
read
or
write
music
notation

He
is
credited
for
playing
guitar
keyboard
and
drums
but
was
not
proficient
in
them

When
composing
he
recorded
ideas
by
beatboxing
and
imitating
instruments
vocally

Describing
the
process
he
said
I
ll
just
sing
the
bass
part
into
the
tape
recorder

I
ll
take
that
bass
lick
and
put
the
chords
of
the
melody
over
the
bass
lick
and
that
s
what
inspires
the
melody

These
were
shown
in
his
demos
for
Beat
It
and
Billie
Jean
where
he
vocalized
the
melody
bass
instrumentals
as
well
as
lead
and
backing
vocals
by
overlaying
each
component

The
engineer
Robert
Hoffman
recalled
that
after
Jackson
came
in
with
a
song
he
had
written
overnight
Jackson
sang
every
note
of
every
chord
to
a
guitar
player

Hoffman
also
remembered
Jackson
singing
string
arrangements
part
by
part
into
a
cassette
recorder

Dance
Jackson
danced
from
a
young
age
as
part
of
the
Jackson
and
incorporated
dance
extensively
in
his
performances
and
music
videos

According
to
Sanjoy
Roy
of
The
Guardian
Jackson
would
flick
and
retract
his
limbs
like
switchblades
or
snap
out
of
a
tornado
spin
into
a
perfectly
poised
toe
stand


The
moonwalk
taught
to
him
by
Jeffrey
Daniel
was
Jackson
s
signature
dance
move
and
one
of
the
most
famous
of
the
th
century

Jackson
is
credited
for
coining
the
name
moonwalk
for
this
street
dance
move
previously
known
as
the
backslide


His
other
moves
included
the
robot
crotch
grab
and
the
anti
gravity
lean
of
the
Smooth
Criminal
video

Steve

refined
the

of
Off

the
dance
and
rock
tracks
were
more
aggressive
while
the
pop

his
maturation
into
an
adult
Robert
Christgau
wrote
in
Christgau
s
Record
Guide
Rock
Albums
of
the
Seventies


The
album
s
title
track
suggested
to
the
critic
a
parallel
between
Jackson
and
Stevie
Wonder
s
oddball
music
personas
Since
childhood
his
main
contact
with
the
real
world
has
been
on
stage
and
in
bed

With
Thriller
Christopher
Connelly
of
Rolling
Stone
commented
that
Jackson
developed
his
long
association
with
the
subliminal
theme
of
paranoia
and
darker
imagery

AllMusic
s
Stephen
Thomas
Erlewine
noted
this
on
the
songs
Billie
Jean
and
Wanna
Be
Startin
Somethin


In
Billie
Jean
Jackson
depicts
an
obsessive
fan
who
alleges
he
has
fathered
her
child
and
in
Wanna
Be
Startin
Somethin
he
argues
against
gossip

the

in
a
homage
to
West

and
was
Jackson
s
first
successful

over
piece
according
to
Huey

He
observed
that
Thriller
began
Jackson
s
interest
with
the
theme
of
the
supernatural
a
topic
he
revisited
in
subsequent
years

In
Jackson
co

The

is
a
traditional
love
ballad
and
Man

is
a
ballad
of

Smooth

an
evocation
of

and

AllMusic
s
Stephen
Thomas
Erlewine
states
that
Dangerous
presents
Jackson
as
a
paradoxical
person

The
first
half
of
the
record
is
dedicated
to
new
jack
swing
including
songs
like
Jam
and
Remember

It
was
the
first

in
which
social
ills
became
a
primary
theme
Why
You
Wanna
Trip
on
Me
for
example
protests
world
hunger
AIDS
homelessness
and
drugs

Dangerous
contains
sexually
charged
songs
such
as
In
the
Closet


The
title
track
continues
the
theme
of
the
predatory
lover
and
compulsive
desire

The
second
half
includes
introspective
pop
gospel
anthems
such
as
Will
You
Be
There
Heal
the
World
and
Keep
the
Faith


In
the
ballad
Gone

Jackson
gives
tribute
to

directs
his
anger
at

laments
his

broke
racial
barriers
on
MTV
which
had
launched
two
years
earlier

Before
Thriller
Jackson
struggled
to
receive
coverage
on
MTV
allegedly
because
he
was
African
American

Pressure
from
CBS
Records
persuaded
MTV
to
start
showing
Billie
Jean
and
later
Beat
It
which
led
to
a
lengthy
partnership
with
Jackson
and
helped
other
black
music
artists
gain
recognition

The
popularity
of
his
videos
on
MTV
helped
the
relatively
new
channel
s
viewing
figures
and
MTV
s
focus
shifted
toward
pop
and
R
B

His
performance
on
Motown

changed
the
scope
of
live
stage
shows
making
it
acceptable
for
artists
to
lip

asked
by

interview
about
why
he
grabbed
his
crotch
he
said
it

as
infamous


It
featured
Wesley

For
the

Jackson
experimented
with
leaning
forward
at
a
degree
angle
beyond
the
performer
s
center
of

To
accomplish
this
live
Jackson
and
designers
developed
a
special
shoe
to
lock
the
performer

feet
to
the
stage
allowing
them
to
lean
forward

In
he
left
the
Jehovah
s
Witnesses

There
was
strong
opposition
to
his
Thriller
video
on
the
part
of
some
Witnesses

Perhaps
the
controversy
figured
into
his
decision
to
leave

But
I
don
t
know
that
for
a
fact
because
I
didn
t
talk
to
him
about
what
he
d
done

I
couldn
t

Witnesses
do
not
discuss
spiritual
matters
with
a
person
who
has
disassociated
himself
from
the
Witnesses
including
family
members

But
I
want
to
stress
that
contrary
to
published
reports
I
was
not
required
to
shun
my
son

Our
relationship
is
as
loving
today
as
it
was
when
he
was
a
Witness

I
just
can
t
ask
him
Why

Folklore
and
local
colour
There
is
a
story
that
when
Alexandre
Dumas
play
Christine
was
banned
shortly
before
the
Revolution
Dumas
went
to
plead
his
case
to
the
acad
micien
and
censor
Charles
Brifaut

Brifaut
suggested
what
seemed
to
him
minor
alterations
such
as
the
sex
of
the
protagonist
and
mentioned
that
under
the
First
Empire
he
had
been
obliged
to
do
much
the
same

A
play
of
his
set
in
Spain
was
considered
too
inflammatory
given
the
Emperor
s
difficulties
in
that
country
so
he
changed
some
names
and
locations
and
transformed
it
into
Ninus
II
an
acceptable
drama
of
ancient
Babylon

Dumas
exclaimed
But
really
Monsieur
Brifaut
the
local
colour
Brifaut
smiled
and
replied
Monsieur
in
our
time
for
us
local
colour
had
not
yet
been
invented

Brifaut
s
cynicism
is
echoed
by
many
contemporary
historians

Dumas
was
shocked
because
Brifaut
had
in
his
opinion
sacrificed
the
authenticity
of
the
work
what
was
true
of
Spain
could
not
also
be
true
of
Babylon

But
for
post
modern
historians
trained
to
unpick
invented
traditions
and
imagined
communities
the
Romantics
yearning
for
authenticity
has
itself
become
suspect

The
whole
nineteenth
century
enterprise
of
defining
cultural
difference
through
nation
building
imperial
exploration
and
social
investigation
can
be
seen
in
retrospect
as
a
fabrication
in
which
the
self
serving
taxonomies
of
elites
were
imposed
on
suspect
data

The
academic
subjects
built
on
this
concern
for
explaining
difference
history
sociology
and
anthropology
have
likewise
had
their
credentials
as
social
sciences
severely
weakened

But
the
subject
which
has
suffered
most
by
the
retreat
into
reflexivity
is
folklore

Pioneer
sociologists
and
anthropologists
may
have
been
keen
to
collect
and
classify
but
from
the
start
folklorists
saw
themselves
in
a
more
active
role
reviving
threatened
traditions

The
issue
of
authenticity
was
always
therefore
of
greater
significance
to
folklore

For
romantics
like
Dumas
an
enthusiastic
reader
and
translator
of
the
Grimms
folklore
was
all
about
local
colour

The
subject
had
been
born
out
of
an
assertion
of
cultural
difference
in
reaction
to
the
universalist
ambitions
of
the
Enlightenment

Johann
Gottfried
Herder
put
its
case
most
clearly
what
was
true
and
good
for
France
was
alien
to
Germany
for
each
nation
had
over
centuries
developed
its
own
unique
traditions
ideally
suited
to
the
character
of
its
people

The
essence
of
this
unique
culture
what
Herder
called
the
folk
soul
was
expressed
in
language
and
in
particular
in
folk
song
and
tale

No
one
person
could
claim
authorship
of
ballads
they
were
the
communal
almost
unconscious
creation
of
the
nation
as
a
whole

Every
singer
was
connected
to
the
collective
body
of
the
nation
and
simultaneously
to
their
ancestors
from
whom
they
had
inherited
this
traditional
lore

This
is
a
well
known
story
but
there
is
one
point
that
I
would
like
to
emphasise

Herder
believed
that
the
origins
of
cultural
difference
lay
in
the
environment
Nature
has
sketched
with
the
mountain
ranges
she
formed
and
with
the
rivers
she
made
flow
from
them
the
rough
but
definite
outline
of
the
entire
history
of
man
Oceans
mountain
chains
and
rivers
are
the
most
natural
boundaries
not
only
of
lands
but
also
of
peoples
customs
languages
and
empires

The
customs
of
each
nation
had
been
shaped
by
the
landscape
in
which
they
lived

Folklore
was
not
just
the
expression
of
a
people
and
its
history
but
of
the
land
itself

Thus
the
Grimms
were
able
to
describe
the
tales
collected
from
their
their
principal
informants
Dorothea
Viehmann
the
so
called
M
rchenfrau
of
Niederzwehren
and
Old
Marie
as
authentically
Hessian
and
originally
Hessian


Emile
Souvestre
a
romantic
poet
and
one
of
the
earliest
imitators
of
the
Grimms
in
France
expressed
this
connection
between
story
and
geography
in
an
environmental
clich
when
introducing
his
collection
Le
Foyer
breton
we
have
only
published
those
folktales
which
exhale
that
smell
of
the
land
which
cannot
be
imitated

More
than
a
hundred
years
later
the
compiler
of
the
French
folktale
index
Paul
Delarue
echoed
this
sentiment
in
France
as
in
the
other
countries
folktales
have
through
the
course
of
the
centuries
been
subjected
to
the
influence
of
the
physical
and
human
environment
of
the
particular
genius
of
the
race
and
they
have
acquired
characteristics
that
are
unique

These
unique
characteristics
might
be
obvious
to
collectors
able
to
compare
and
contrast
the
narrative
tradition
of
many
communities
but
it
is
questionable
whether
they
could
have
been
identified
by
the
narrators
of
folktales

Folklorists
seldom
asked
their
informants
where
they
thought
their
stories
originated
but
Ariane
de
F
lice
who
conducted
fieldwork
in
the
marshland
of
the
Loire
estuary
after
the
Second
World
War
was
the
exception

She
was
told
They
must
have
been
more
intelligent
than
most
the
guys
who
invented
this
You
won
t
find
that
here

They
come
perhaps
from
the
depths
of
England
or
I
don
t
know
where

Their
exotic
quality
was
indeed
part
of
the
tales
attraction

None
of
her
narrators
who
all
came
from
the
one
village
suggested
that
there
was
anything
particularly
Breton
about
their
tales
and
yet
F
lice
s
book
was
entitled
Contes
de
Haute
Bretagne

To
this
day
it
is
almost
impossible
to
find
a
folktale
collection
which
does
not
claim
to
be
in
some
way
expressive
of
a
region
or
nation

The
primacy
of
collective
identities
be
they
ethnic
cultural
or
geographic
is
the
legacy
bequeathed
by
romantic
nationalism
to
folklore

Folk
wisdom
however
recognised
the
ease
with
which
songs
and
stories
were
diffused
around
the
globe
and
this
has
been
understood
at
a
scholarly
level
also

Delarue
catalogued
the
French
folktales
according
to
the
international
index
of
tale
types

The
tale
of
Cinderella
is
tale
type
and
one
can
go
to
the
folktale
catalogue
of
any
country
from
China
to
the
Caribbean
and
find
examples
of
tales
that
fit
this
typology

The
story
was
popular
in
France
but
not
specific
to
France

The
same
is
true
of
other
genres
of
folklore
whether
we
are
talking
of
riddles
proverbs
legends
or
folksongs
it
is
difficult
to
find
examples
limited
to
just
one
region
or
one
nation

They
all
have
analogues
in
other
countries

Delarue
knew
this
his
argument
was
that
the
way
Cinderella
was
told
in
France
was
characteristically
French

For
example
it
lacked
the
cruelty
and
overt
moralising
that
he
associated
with
German
tales

And
it
is
true
that
while
Cinderella
was
moreorless
universally
known
the
tale
was
never
told
exactly
the
same
way
in
different
places

But
was
this
variation
a
reflection
of
national
or
regional
cultural
difference
or
did
it
have
more
to
do
with
the
sex
of
the
narrators
their
occupations
and
personalities
or
the
personalities
of
the
collectors
This
last
is
the
most
serious
charge
for
it
threatens
not
only
to
deny
folklore
s
claims
to
reveal
specific
cultures
but
to
undermine
the
entire
collecting
project

What
if
folklorists
as
collectors
and
editors
shaped
the
final
work
to
fit
ideological
agendas
of
their
own
This
is
indeed
the
accusation
levelled
at
Emile
Souvestre
and
even
more
so
at
his
contemporary
Th
odore
Hersart
de
la
Villemarqu


The
publication
in
of
Villemarqu
s
Barzaz
Breiz
Breton
Ballads
had
an
impact
in
France
akin
to
MacPherson
s
Ossian

Unfortunately
there
were
other
parallels

Villemarqu
was
a
Breton
patriot
who
wanted
to
endow
his
homeland
with
an
epic
literature
to
rival
that
of
any
nation

He
was
also
an
aristocrat
a
conservative
and
a
Catholic
and
the
Breton
nation
he
envisioned
was
pious
deferential
and
static
preserved
by
its
language
and
traditions
from
the
taint
of
revolutionary
modernity

The
ballads
he
discovered
suited
all
these
purposes
admirably

Although
he
styled
himself
as
the
collector
and
translator
of
the
Breton
ballads
the
suspicion
arose
that
he
was
in
fact
their
author

The
Querelle
over
the
authenticity
of
the
Barzaz
Breiz
which
irrupted
in
continues
to
rumble
on
but
a
prevailing
albeit
erroneous
judgement
in
academic
circles
is
that
Villemarqu
s
ballads
like
MacPherson
s
fragments
were
forgeries

Villemarqu
is
not
the
only
nineteenth
century
folklorist
to
fall
under
the
critical
spot
light
not
least
because
many
French
folklorists
were
likewise
aligned
with
the
Catholic
Royalist
right

Their
desire
to
establish
a
connection
between
the
land
and
its
people
through
its
folklore
has
been
seen
as
a
defensive
ploy
by
traditional
elites
landowners
and
clerics
in
the
face
of
rural
depopulation
social
mobility
and
radical
political
upheaval

It
is
not
just
that
folklorists
were
local
patriots
with
regionalist
or
autonomist
objectives
though
many
were
but
it
is
also
a
question
of
the
kind
of
country
or
region
they
were
patriotic
about

Why
in
France
for
example
did
practically
every
folklorist
reject
the
administrative
boundaries
created
by
the
Revolution
the
departments
in
favour
of
collecting
the
folklore
of
the
Old
Regime
provinces
such
as
Lorraine
Franche
Comt
Normandy
The
implicit
or
explicit
explanation
is
that
the
provinces
represented
genuine
cultural
units
but
there
is
sometimes
at
least
the
hint
of
counter
revolutionary
nostalgia

Folklorists
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
claimed
that
theirs
was
an
objective
science
with
its
own
vigorous
methodology

But
the
suspicion
among
academics
today
is
that
folklore
was
less
the
creation
of
the
folk
than
the
imposition
derived
from
political
and
aesthetic
movements
among
d
racin
intellectuals

The
implications
of
such
revisionism
are
not
limited
to
folklore

With
the
development
of
social
history
since
the
s
historians
have
mined
folklore
collections
to
uncover
the
hidden
lives
of
the
popular
classes
developing
such
explanatory
schemas
as
popular
religion
popular
medicine
and
popular
culture

Yet
recently
all
these
categories
have
been
dismissed
as
constructions
derived
from
the
discourses
of
nineteenth
century
elites

Even
the
very
concept
of
peasant
has
been
called
into
question

What
for
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
has
been
the
most
influential
approach
to
nineteenth
century
rural
France
Eugen
Weber
s
history
of
the
acculturation
of
regional
and
traditional
societies
in
the
process
of
transforming
Peasants
into
Frenchmen
crumbles
if
the
very
categories
of
peasant
tradition
and
region
were
nothing
more
than
the
ideological
projections
of
nation
builders

As
a
consequence
the
peasants
who
seemed
to
speak
to
us
from
the
pages
of
folklore
collections
have
been
once
more
condemned
to
historical
marginality
for
their
voices
will
always
be
hidden
behind
the
discourses
of
the
dominant

I
am
unwilling
to
accept
this
conclusion
and
the
remainder
of
this
paper
will
attempt
to
show
that
nineteenth
century
folklorists
were
basically
correct
in
proposing
a
connection
between
cultural
traditions
and
a
particular
community
and
that
the
relationship
between
the
land
and
the
lore
was
suggested
to
them
by
their
informants
rather
than
imposed
on
them

This
does
not
mean
that
I
think
folklorists
always
correctly
identified
what
that
connection
was
and
in
the
case
of
France
the
largely
unreflecting
use
of
pre
revolutionary
provincial
titles
is
unhelpful

But
mislabelling
should
not
prevent
us
realising
what
folklorists
intuitively
grasped
that
there
was
a
link
between
the
stories
they
heard
and
the
landscapes
in
which
they
were
told

To
demonstrate
this
I
will
call
on
the
collection
made
by
Paul
S
billot
between
and
in
and
around
the
village
of
Saint
Cast
near
to
Saint
Malo
on
the
north
Breton
coast

Paul
S
billot
and
the
storytellers
of
Saint
Cast
Although
Paul
S
billot
was
the
dominant
figure
in
French
folklore
studies
at
the
end
the
nineteenth
century
he
did
not
conform
to
the
stereotype
of
the
Breton
traditionalist

He
was
certainly
no
pious
aristocrat
like
Villemarqu
and
it
is
worth
mentioning
that
despite
the
supposed
inherent
conservatism
of
folklorists
in
Brittany
at
least
it
was
as
much
an
enthusiasm
of
the
left

Emile
Souvestre
had
stood
as
a
Republican
candidate
in
while
leading
contemporaries
of
S
billot
included
Fran
ois
Marie
Luzel
and
Adolphe
Orain
both
editors
of
Republican
newspapers

S
billot
was
born
at
Matignon
C
tes
du
Nord
in
the
son
of
a
doctor
and
a
Republican
activist

He
inherited
his
father
s
politics
writing
a
popular
pamphlet
in
entitled
La
R
publique
c
est
la
tranquilit
which
Luzel
translated
into
Breton

He
married
the
sister
of
the
economist
and
Republican
politician
Yves
Guyot
who
as
editor
of
Le
Si
cle
was
a
well
known
advocate
of
radical
causes
from
Dreyfus
to
feminism

Yet
despite
his
Republican
and
anticlerical
affiliations
in
other
ways
S
billot
was
true
to
the
folklorist
type

He
was
a
member
of
a
well
educated
and
well
connected
bourgeois
family
a
rival
folklorist
would
later
accuse
him
of
abusing
his
position
as
ch
telain
to
make
his
collections

He
was
also
a
d
racin
having
settled
in
Paris
first
as
a
law
student
and
then
as
an
artist
and
writer

Folklore
at
least
initially
had
been
the
exiled
S
billot
s
tribute
to
his
homeland

His
local
patriotism
had
been
fired
by
a
borrowed
copy
of
Souvestre
s
Le
Foyer
breton
while
a
homesick
schoolboy
in


In
his
memoirs
S
billot
recalled
that
the
idea
came
to
me
to
discover
if
there
were
in
my
native
land
marvellous
or
fantastic
stories
worthy
of
inclusion
in
a
Gallo
Hearth

But
what
attracted
S
billot
most
about
Souvestre
s
book
were
the
illustrations
for
he
was
already
nursing
artistic
ambitions

From
to
he
pursued
a
career
as
a
painter

As
the
art
critic
for
various
Republican
journals
in
the
s
and
a
visitor
to
Pont
Aven
S
billot
presumably
knew
of
the
impressionists
but
he
did
not
follow
their
lead

Nor
despite
his
interest
in
the
marvellous
is
there
anything
fey
let
alone
symbolist
about
his
paintings

S
billot
s
artistic
allegiances
were
with
the
realism
of
Am
d
e
Gu
rard
and
Alexandre
Antigna

He
specialised
in
landscapes
of
the
Breton
coast
and
in
particular
the
strange
scenery
of
low
tide
his
first
salon
piece
in
was
entitled
Rocks
at
Low
Tide


This
is
not
a
minor
genre
along
Brittany
s
c
te
d
emeraude
where
the
sea
level
falls
several
metres
daily
revealing
the
rocks
that
made
this
coast
so
dangerous
for
shipping

There
is
an
unexplored
connection
between
the
practice
of
landscape
painting
and
folklore
collecting
in
the
nineteenth
century

Souvestre
had
been
a
painter
before
he
turned
to
writing
while
artists
like
Jules
Bastien
Lepage
occasionally
dabbled
in
folklore

In
S
billot
s
case
the
meticulousness
and
commitment
to
accuracy
apparent
in
his
paintings
would
also
resurface
in
his
work
as
a
folklorist
for
although
he
acknowledged
a
debt
to
predecessors
like
Villemarqu
he
considered
himself
the
leader
of
a
new
generation
of
scientific
investigators

S
billot
s
conversion
from
brush
to
pen
was
particularly
fruitful

In
the
artist
L
once
Petit
asked
S
billot
if
he
could
contribute
some
stories
to
a
book
of
fairy
tales
that
his
friend
hoped
to
illustrate

S
billot
promised
to
see
what
he
could
unearth
the
following
summer
while
on
a
painting
trip
to
Brittany

But
the
weather
that
year
was
dismal
and
while
sheltering
with
peasant
families
S
billot
asked
his
hosts
if
they
knew
any
tales

The
more
than
six
hundred
narratives
he
collected
over
the
following
years
were
the
basis
for
S
billot
s
brilliant
career
as
a
folklorist

They
provided
the
matter
for
more
than
a
dozen
major
publications
starting
in
with
the
first
volume
of
Contes
populaires
de
la
Haute
Bretagne

The
title
implied
that
these
were
characteristically
Breton
tales

S
billot
like
other
folklorists
placed
his
collection
within
the
framework
of
a
geographically
specific
culture
a
trend
he
would
help
propagate
as
editor
of
the
major
collection
Les
Litt
ratures
populaires
de
toutes
les
nations


But
S
billot
was
ahead
of
his
time
in
recognising
that
his
informants
occupations
were
as
significant
to
the
kind
of
stories
they
told
as
the
places
they
lived

More
than
half
the
tales
were
collected
in
and
around
the
fishing
village
of
Saint
Cast
not
far
from
his
hometown
of
Matignon

Hence
the
third
volume
of
the
Contes
populaires
de
la
Haute
Bretagne
was
subtitled
Contes
des
marins

S
billot
had
come
to
Saint
Cast
in
to
paint
but
the
storytelling
talent
of
his
landlady
Rose
Renault
set
him
on
a
different
tack

Her
house
became
the
centre
of
S
billot
s
collecting
activities
as
her
visitors
were
invited
to
contribute
a
tale

Among
them
was
the
story
in
the
appendix
told
in
by
an
elderly
widow
named
Jeanne
le
H
riss


It
concerns
one
of
those
watery
rock
formations
S
billot
painted
so
often
the
Bourdineaux

Oral
history
and
folk
geography
The
Bourdineaux
or
Bourdinots
as
they
now
appear
on
maps
are
a
group
of
rocks
off
the
tip
of
the
Saint
Cast
peninsular
close
to
the
spot
marked
on
S
billot
s
map
of
the
legendary
geography
of
the
area

For
fishermen
the
virtue
of
these
offshore
rocks
was
that
they
were
a
haven
for
marine
wild
life
and
in
the
case
of
the
Bourdineaux
for
skate
in
particular

Le
Heriss
s
story
tells
of
a
battle
for
control
of
the
rocks
between
the
C
tins
of
Saint
Cast
and
the
Jaguens
of
the
rival
fishing
village
of
Saint
Jacut
which
faced
them
across
the
Arguenon
estuary

There
are
numerous
stories
about
conflicts
between
these
two
villages
several
of
which
focus
on
this
same
group
of
rocks

For
example
in
another
tale
the
Jaguens
drop
a
dead
donkey
in
the
sea
in
order
to
claim
all
the
land
it
touched
but
unfortunately
for
them
it
by
passed
the
Bourdineaux

The
donkey
story
was
probably
intended
as
a
joke
but
the
Jeanne
le
H
riss
told
her
tale
as
a
matter
of
history

She
had
learnt
it
from
her
grandfather
and
according
to
him
the
battle
had
taken
place
two
centuries
before

It
is
quite
likely
that
the
story
has
some
basis
in
history

Ownership
or
use
rights
over
land
was
a
dominant
issue
in
village
politics
throughout
France
from
the
Middle
Ages
onwards

Most
communities
were
at
one
time
or
another
engaged
in
protracted
conflicts
with
their
neighbours
about
their
precise
boundaries
access
to
water
the
use
of
the
woods
and
pastures
between
them

These
kinds
of
resources
were
either
communal
property
or
at
least
considered
as
communal
property
and
so
any
dispute
would
involve
the
community
as
a
whole

The
court
records
of
both
old
regime
and
post
revolutionary
France
abound
in
such
cases
but
conflict
was
not
restricted
to
legal
argument
it
was
carried
into
the
fields



Conscription
rallies
fairs
and
even
Breton
pardons
were
all
occasions
for
collective
violence
because
at
these
events
rival
villagers
were
bound
to
meet
and
therefore
argue
with
one
another

In
some
parts
of
France
even
in
the
nineteenth
century
such
riots
frequently
led
to
fatalities

These
village
wars
tended
to
have
a
history

Even
if
boundaries
were
finally
agreed
the
vendetta
between
them
left
legacies
of
triumphs
to
be
boasted
humiliations
to
be
avenged
events
to
be
memorised
and
retold
at
communal
gatherings

The
economic
issue
might
be
settled
but
the
conflict
was
perpetuated
through
the
village
s
oral
culture
which
enshrined
its
code
of
honour

Although
the
Bourdineaux
were
at
sea
their
case
was
not
essentially
different
from
any
landlocked
dispute

They
were
a
collective
economic
resource
to
which
two
communities
laid
claim

Looking
at
the
map
it
would
seem
as
if
the
C
tins
were
in
the
right

There
were
as
they
say
in
story
fishing
right
in
front
of
their
homes

And
yet
other
tales
even
those
told
in
Saint
Cast
acknowledged
some
historic
relationship
between
the
Jaguens
and
the
Bourdineaux

There
are
two
possible
explanations
for
this

Firstly
the
Jaguens
specialised
in
the
fishing
of
skate

This
is
still
apparent
in
the
architecture
of
the
village
which
is
arranged
in
house
rows
with
a
south
facing
fa
ade
where
the
skate
were
hung
to
dry

The
smell
was
to
judge
by
the
frequent
comments
in
the
tales
appalling

As
the
Bourdineaux
abounded
in
skate
the
Jaguens
may
have
felt
a
proprietorial
interest
in
them

Secondly
fishing
rights
in
the
estuary
of
the
Arguenon
river
had
been
the
seigneurial
property
of
the
Abbey
of
Saint
Jacut
so
fish
caught
in
these
waters
had
to
be
landed
at
Saint
Jacut

At
a
pinch
the
Bourdineaux
might
be
included
within
this
seigneurial
domain
although
they
were
at
boundary
of
the
open
sea

As
a
consequence
there
were
in
the
sixteenth
century
numerous
stands
off
between
the
fishing
fleets
of
the
two
villages
leading
to
insults
and
even
injuries

From
the
seventeenth
century
onwards
the
men
of
both
communities
found
employment
in
deep
sea
fishing
in
shore
fishing
declined
and
with
it
the
economic
importance
of
the
Bourdineaux

But
the
dispute
was
not
forgotten
and
references
to
it
were
sure
to
enliven
encounters
between
the
inhabitants
of
the
two
peninsulas

Indeed
the
history
was
still
being
related
in
the
s
according
to
Herv
Collet
who
audio
taped
the
same
tale
as
told
an
old
sailor
of
Saint
Jacut

Unfortunately
this
Jaguen
version
of
events
probably
owes
more
to
a
S
billot
reprint
than
to
any
autochthon
tradition
even
though
there
are
telling
differences
between
the
two

However
it
was
not
to
history
that
each
group
appealed
during
their
confrontation
but
to
legend
in
particular
to
divergent
legends
of
Gargantua

The
story
also
alludes
to
several
other
religious
comic
and
aetiological
legends
which
would
help
listeners
make
sense
of
their
local
geography

Nineteenth
century
folklorists
were
more
interested
in
the
text
than
the
context
and
seldom
asked
themselves
why
particular
stories
were
being
told
at
particular
moments

But
in
Le
H
riss
s
tale
it
is
clear
that
legends
were
not
just
amusing
pastimes
they
had
a
function
it
is
this
functional
aspect
that
provides
the
link
between
a
particular
landscape
and
the
stories
told
within
it

Legends
were
mobilized
as
charters
of
ownership
by
the
communities
that
told
them

According
to
the
Jaguens
the
Bourdineaux
belonged
to
them
because
the
rocks
were
thrown
from
their
village
by
the
giant
Gargantua

The
C
tins
agreed
that
Gargantua
deposited
the
rocks
but
not
for
the
Jaguens
rather
in
disgust
at
them

There
is
a
whole
cycle
of
Gargantua
legends
concerning
this
coastline
often
associated
with
particular
features
such
as
Gargantua
s
tooth
near
Saint
Suliac
or
his
finger
at
Fort
La
Latte
both
prehistoric
standing
stones


S
billot
collected
several
Gargantua
legends
in
Saint
Cast

They
did
not
concur
in
every
detail
but
it
is
nonetheless
possible
to
compile
an
outline
biography
for
the
giant
that
might
have
been
recognised
by
C
tins

To
summarize
Gargantua
was
born
at
Pl
venon

He
liked
to
travel
and
visited
Dinan
Saint
Malo
Paris
and
Jersey

In
each
place
he
terrorised
the
inhabitants
with
his
enormous
appetite
and
marked
the
landscape
in
some
permanent
way

His
leap
from
Fort
La
Latte
to
Saint
Malo
or
in
another
version
to
Jersey
for
instance
is
commemorated
by
the
indent
of
the
giant
s
shoe
on
the
cliff
top

Practically
all
the
rocks
off
the
coast
were
ascribed
to
Gargantua
s
actions

According
to
Fran
ois
Marquer
the
C
tin
cabinboy
who
was
S
billot
s
most
forthcoming
informant
the
Becrond
or
Bec
rond
s
it
now
appears
on
maps
where
the
C
tin
fleet
waited
to
attack
the
Jaguens
was
the
result
of
a
Gargantuan
bout
of
diarrhoea

The
Bourdineaux
were
created
shortly
after
by
the
giant
s
attempts
to
kill
a
barnacle
goose
flying
out
to
sea
by
throwing
stones
taken
from
the
headland

Presumably
the
Jaguens
were
referring
to
a
similar
story
localised
in
their
own
village
during
their
confrontation
on
the
Bourdineaux

The
C
tins
response
was
that
Gargantua
felt
too
much
disgust
for
the
Jaguens
to
provide
for
them
in
this
way

The
story
as
told
in
Saint
Cast
was
that
Gargantua
had
been
coming
home
to
Pl
venon
when
he
came
across
a
Jaguen
boat
loaded
with
skate
caught
on
the
Bourdineaux

He
gobbled
down
the
boat
crew
and
catch
but
as
his
journey
took
him
past
Saint
Jacut
the
smell
of
rotting
fish
made
him
throw
up
his
meal

The
ballast
stones
from
the
boat
were
projected
out
to
sea
and
formed
various
islands
towards
Saint
Briac
and
Saint
Lunaire
in
the
opposite
direction
to
Saint
Cast
and
therefore
undisputed
territory
as
far
as
C
tins
were
concerned


In
other
stories
Gargantua
did
not
eat
the
Jaguen
boat
simply
the
smell
of
its
cargo
was
enough
to
make
him
vomit
up
various
rocks
and
islands

In
some
tales
Gargantua
then
quit
the
country
with
the
words
I
don
t
want
to
see
the
Jaguens
any
more
they
will
kill
me
with
their
obnoxiousness
in
others
he
really
was
overcome
with
disgust
and
died

C
tins
and
Jaguens
told
two
contradictory
legends
about
Gargantua
and
the
Bourdineaux
but
to
what
extent
were
either
believed
Belief
used
to
be
the
test
that
folklorists
applied
to
distinguish
a
folktale
from
a
legend
the
former
being
told
as
a
fiction
and
the
latter
as
a
true
account

However
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
anyone
could
countenance
that
a
handful
of
ballast
stones
provided
the
basis
for
several
islands

All
we
can
say
is
that
the
story
just
like
Le
H
riss
s
was
told
as
if
it
might
be
true
and
so
could
be
cited
as
fact
in
disputes
between
the
two
villages

But
belief
was
not
as
essential
as
agreement
among
the
community
as
to
which
was
the
right
story
or
rather
which
was
the
right
story
for
a
particular
occasion


Which
story
you
knew
and
told
about
Gargantua
the
Bourdineaux
and
the
Jaguens
would
indicate
where
your
loyalties
lay

Thus
the
shared
story
became
the
basis
for
communal
solidarity

Le
H
riss
s
tale
draws
on
many
other
distinctions
between
the
two
villages

The
two
fleets
even
arrive
on
the
scene
in
different
kinds
of
boat
those
of
the
Jaguens
are
called
simply
boats
but
the
C
tins
had
dinghies


Canot
or
dinghy
was
the
term
used
for
the
small
stubby
but
manoeuvrable
boats
that
fishermen
of
both
villages
adopted
during
the
nineteenth
century

The
implication
of
the
story
however
is
that
the
C
tins
had
them
first
they
were
therefore
more
up
to
date
and
civilised
than
their
neighbours

This
claim
to
cultural
superiority
was
confirmed
whenever
the
Jaguens
opened
their
mouths

By
and
large
S
billot
s
fishermen
storytellers
spoke
good
French
when
telling
tales
and
were
proud
of
it

Patois
was
for
them
the
language
of
peasants
who
had
never
learnt
anything
of
the
world

Yet
according
to
S
billot
whenever
one
of
his
storytellers
adopted
the
voice
of
a
Jaguen
he
or
she
would
put
on
a
distinct
accent
and
lace
their
speech
with
characteristic
swearing
Dieu
me
danse
or
Dieu
me
gagne
a
change
S
billot
indicated
on
the
written
page
with
italics

He
went
on
to
point
out
however
that
the
level
of
education
and
therefore
presumably
correct
French
usage
was
higher
in
Saint
Jacut
than
in
nearby
villages

But
for
the
storyteller
it
was
not
necessary
that
Jaguens
actually
spoke
like
this
but
that
her
audience
and
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
region
generally
understood
that
this
was
how
Jaguens
were
supposed
to
speak

Storytellers
from
all
over
France
used
similar
tactics
to
denigrate
their
despised
neighbours

A
further
distinction
between
the
villages
is
offered
by
the
collective
nicknames
the
blason
populaire
exchanged
between
the
fishermen

The
C
tins
apparently
because
of
the
colour
of
their
water
proofs
were
called
petits
Jaunes
by
the
Jaguens
while
the
latter
were
termed
Houohaous


According
to
S
billot
most
C
tins
thought
this
was
an
insult
implying
that
the
Jaguens
howled
like
dogs
but
it
may
have
derived
from
Saint
Houohaou
the
name
given
by
the
fishermen
to
a
rock
at
the
end
of
the
Saint
Jacut
peninsular

As
they
passed
the
rock
Jaguens
would
offer
up
a
prayer
Saint
Houohaou
give
us
mackerel


Every
village
in
France
seems
to
have
had
at
least
one
such
collective
sobriquet
picking
up
on
some
distinguishing
aspect
of
dress
economic
activity
character
or
history

However
the
blason
was
not
used
by
the
villagers
themselves
only
by
their
neighbours
who
were
also
their
enemies

They
were
commonly
exchanged
during
disputes
over
territories

The
origins
of
many
nicknames
are
obscure
but
where
they
can
be
traced
they
often
relate
to
places
or
events
on
these
disputed
frontiers

The
rock
of
Saint
Houohaou
for
example
is
at
the
edge
of
the
commune
of
Saint
Jacut
and
the
open
sea

It
is
in
a
sense
a
boundary
marker

Geography
and
cultural
identity
are
once
more
brought
together

The
people
of
Saint
Cast
held
the
Jaguens
in
low
esteem
Daft
as
a
Jaguen
went
the
local
proverb

This
reputation
was
widely
known
on
the
coast

S
billot
collected
stories
about
Jaguens
at
Dinard
Matignon
and
even
one
from
an
inhabitant
of
Saint
Jacut

At
Dinan
stories
about
idiots
whatever
their
origin
were
termed
a
Jaguens
t
s


An
example
of
such
a
tale
is
the
Jaguens
Journey


Because
they
were
so
backward
and
had
never
left
their
village
before
they
mistook
a
field
of
flax
for
the
sea
and
a
partridge
for
a
feathered
fish

On
another
occasion
they
thought
a
lobster
was
the
devil

Similar
if
less
maritime
stories
were
told
about
dozens
of
other
villages
in
France
and
further
afield
such
as
the
famous
Wise
Men
of
Gotham
in
Nottinghamshire
just
one
of
at
least
forty
five
places
in
England
described
as
the
village
of
fools


Numskull
tales
as
these
kind
of
tales
are
listed
in
the
international
type
index
prove
once
more
that
folklore
knows
no
boundaries

One
can
find
nearly
identical
stories
in
the
literature
of
ancient
India
Turkey
and
China

But
while
they
were
known
all
over
the
world
they
were
not
told
as
universally
valid
but
rather
only
as
true
for
particular
villages

It
was
not
the
folklorist
who
located
them
in
the
landscape
it
was
the
narrators

We
get
a
hint
of
the
Jaguens
reputation
near
the
beginning
of
this
story
when
they
demand
that
no
guns
be
used
as
no
one
in
Saint
Jacut
knew
how
to
fire
one

But
the
full
depth
of
their
stupidity
is
saved
until
the
end
when
disgusted
at
Jesus
for
not
helping
them
even
though
they
had
taken
the
trouble
to
bring
him
along
on
his
cross
they
drag
the
crucifix
through
the
streets
and
finally
burn
it

Despite
or
more
probably
because
of
the
presence
of
an
abbey
in
the
village
several
Jaguen
tales
turn
on
their
misunderstanding
of
or
contempt
for
both
the
symbols
of
the
Church
and
its
personnel

Hence
the
proverbial
phrase
It
s
like
the
old
Jaguens
who
no
more
believed
in
God
than
in
his
saints


C
tins
could
also
be
anticlerical
even
sceptical
on
occasions
and
yet
still
look
down
on
their
neighbours
not
so
much
for
their
lack
of
belief
but
because
they
did
not
know
how
to
behave

Given
S
billot
s
politics
he
probably
rather
enjoyed
these
stories
although
he
got
into
a
bit
of
trouble
with
local
Catholics
when
he
published
the
story
of
the
Le
Bon
Dieu
de
Saint
Jacut
in
a
local
newspaper

In
this
story
the
Jaguens
realise
they
are
the
only
village
without
such
an
asset
which
may
account
for
a
series
of
poor
barley
harvests

But
even
when
they
have
erected
their
own
crucifix
the
harvest
are
no
better
so
they
beat
and
even
shoot
the
figure
of
Jesus

This
may
be
a
deliberately
ironic
counter
comment
to
the
common
legend
of
Breton
piety
in
which
a
peasant
refuses
to
strike
a
crucifix
despite
threats
from
Republican
troops
and
dies
a
martyr
s
death

The
Jaguens
finally
decide
to
kill
their
God
but
unsure
how
this
might
be
done
safely
they
carry
him
over
to
the
Isle
Agot
in
the
bay
and
leave
him
there

Le
H
riss
s
tale
picks
up
on
both
the
Jaguens
anticlerical
reputation
and
their
mistreatment
of
the
crucifix

It
is
also
has
aetiological
aspects
because
the
crucifix
has
since
disappeared
from
the
Isle
Agot
yet
one
can
still
see
the
base
where
it
stood

What
Freud
called
the
narcissism
of
minor
differences
mattered
a
lot
in
these
small
face
to
face
communities

The
untutored
eye
might
have
found
little
to
separate
the
villages
of
Saint
Cast
and
Saint
Jacut
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
C
tins
would
have
been
insulted
by
any
such
comparison

It
would
have
sullied
their
reputation
and
reputation
was
vital
to
their
well
being

The
advancement
of
credit
getting
the
best
berths
on
ship
the
chances
to
make
a
good
marriage
all
depended
on
the
good
name
of
one
s
family
and
community

Yet
reputation
is
a
strange
thing
in
that
one
can
only
increase
one
s
own
by
diminishing
one
s
rivals

Telling
numskull
stories
emphasises
the
superior
reputation
of
one
s
own
community
by
denigrating
another
s
and
this
helps
reunite
one
s
village
in
a
sense
of
its
own
worth

Otherwise
it
was
in
danger
of
being
torn
apart
by
its
own
internal
honour
disputes
between
families
and
colleagues

A
fishing
community
like
Saint
Cast
may
have
had
particular
need
of
the
balm
of
storytelling
which
perhaps
accounts
for
why
S
billot
found
it
such
a
fertile
source


Fishermen
liked
to
create
for
themselves
a
persona
of
aggressive
individualism
so
unlike
the
servile
peasants
they
despised

In
folktales
this
persona
took
shape
as
the
hero
Tribord
Amures
the
sailor
who
gave
way
to
no
man

Such
attitudes
helped
the
men
to
cope
with
the
grinding
misery
of
their
work
on
the
Newfoundland
banks
and
the
ruthless
competition
fostered
between
them
by
the
trawler
captains

Much
of
S
billot
s
collection
was
told
by
boys
apprentice
fishermen
whose
tales
evinced
characteristics
of
devil
may
care
heroism
and
a
refusal
ever
to
bow
one
s
head

Thus
they
demonstrated
they
had
acquired
the
fishermen
s
morality
and
were
ready
to
enter
the
world
of
men

But
fishermen
also
needed
the
community
their
work
was
dangerous
and
their
relied
on
warnings
and
help
given
by
their
colleagues
if
they
died
at
sea
they
needed
to
know
that
their
loved
ones
would
be
cared
for
and
if
they
were
denied
access
to
their
fishing
grounds
they
needed
the
community
to
come
to
their
support
as
in
the
case
of
the
Bourdineaux

Storytelling
was
one
mechanism
through
which
that
community
reconnected
with
itself

This
one
story
of
the
Battle
of
the
Bourdineaux
has
led
us
on
quite
a
tour
of
the
region
around
Saint
Cast
from
Pl
venon
to
the
Isle
Agot

For
a
storyteller
like
Jeanne
Le
H
riss
the
landscape
oozed
narratives

Stories
endowed
space
with
meanings

Guided
by
her
tale
Le
H
riss
s
audience
could
orientate
themselves
in
the
landscape
aetiological
legends
like
that
of
Gargantua
s
finger
and
lieux
dits
such
as
the
Becrond
contained
descriptions
of
landmarks
which
together
formed
a
working
map
of
the
area

Legends
were
an
informal
education
in
significant
geography
one
learnt
the
boundaries
of
one
s
community
with
one
s
neighbours
and
just
as
importantly
with
the
supernatural

Legends
connected
the
vital
history
of
the
community
to
its
environment

No
C
tin
fisherman
could
forget
that
his
ancestors
had
fought
and
won
their
claim
to
the
Bourdineaux
for
the
rocks
themselves
were
a
daily
visual
mnemonic

During
Rogationtide
ceremonies
in
England
boys
accompanying
the
procession
around
the
perimeter
of
the
parish
would
be
beaten
at
each
boundary
marker
to
help
them
more
vividly
their
exact
location

Legends
served
a
similar
if
less
painful
function

They
were
the
collective
memory
of
the
community

Storytelling
also
gave
Jeanne
Le
H
riss
a
continuing
role
in
the
village

The
Le
H
riss
family
had
lived
in
Saint
Cast
since
at
least
the
fifteenth
century
and
although
they
had
lost
their
letters
of
nobility
in
Jeanne
s
great
grandfather
still
styled
himself
noble
cuyer
when
he
built
the
manor
of
Sainte
Blanche
in


But
since
the
revolution
the
family
s
social
status
and
fortune
had
declined
markedly

Jeanne
s
grandfather
had
been
a
substantial
landowner
but
Jeanne
had
married
a
simple
fisherman
Marc
Renault

Like
so
many
of
his
compatriots
he
had
died
at
sea
leaving
her
with
at
least
five
children
to
bring
up

A
widow
in
her
late
fifties
with
three
daughters
still
living
at
home
Jeanne
was
in
danger
of
becoming
a
marginal
figure
even
in
a
matriarchal
community
like
Saint
Cast

Yet
she
retained
some
cultural
capital
she
knew
things
that
might
be
important
to
future
generations
of
C
tins
like
why
the
Bourdineaux
belonged
to
them

In
her
story
both
C
tins
and
Jaguens
turn
to
their
oldest
inhabitants
in
this
crisis
because
as
Jeanne
puts
it
among
the
old
there
is
always
one
cleverer
than
the
others


She
was
in
an
oblique
fashion
talking
about
herself

The
lessons
she
gave
in
folk
geography
staked
her
claim
to
full
membership
in
the
community

Dumas

to
his
recollection
what
shocked
him
was

These
two
works
have
been
very
influential
on
historical
scholarship

Both
concepts
at
least
in
common
usage
among
historians
concern
the
mobilisation
of
collective
identities
supposedly
based
on
historical
continuities
but
which
have
in
fact
been
constructed
by
elites
or
would
be
elites
to
meet
the
needs
of
current
political
ideologies

Anthropology
in
particular
has
been
forced
onto
the
defensive

While
preparing
this
paper
I
chanced
on
this
pithy
challenge
almost
every
generation
of
anthropologists
has
condemned
previous
researchers
for
faulty
studies
imperialistic
or
colonialist
arrogance
or
plain
doctoring
of
the
material

The
idea
of
the
participant
observer
has
little
credibility
in
academic
circles
and
the
standing
of
much
ethnographic
research
is
these
days
roughly
on
a
par
with
reality

Hyrule
A
Geography
and
Cartography

Article
By
Bastian
In
nearly
every
The
Legend
of
Zelda
video
game
we
explore
a
vast
landscape
usually
called
Hyrule
and
yet
no
two
Hyrules
are
ever
identical

Are
we
meant
to
believe
that
Hyrule
is
constantly
suffering
cataclysmic
natural
disasters
which
are
dramatically
changing
its
features
Or
are
we
to
assume
that
there
are
many
different
lands
all
called
Hyrule
within
the
same
world
Or
possibly
worlds
Or
should
we
believe
that
somehow
all
of
these
lands
called
Hyrule
are
in
fact
one
in
the
same
I
fancy
the
latter
myself
and
my
aim
is
to
show
how
this
can
be
possible
despite
the
contrasting
popular
opinion

In
the
Beginning
Let
s
travel
back
in
time
to
the
beginning
to
the
earliest
documentation
of
this
magical
land

In
the
instruction
manual
for
The
Legend
of
Zelda
it
indicates
that
this
game
takes
place
in
a
little
kingdom
in
the
land
of
Hyrule

As
we
discover
in
the
direct
sequel
Zelda
II
The
Adventure
of
Link
such
a
description
couldn
t
be
more
accurate

In
this
sequel
we
are
presented
with
a
tiny
representation
of
the
vast
landscape
we
traversed
in
the
first
game

Clearly
we
are
to
believe
that
Hyrule
as
we
knew
it
in
The
Legend
of
Zelda
is
but
one
tiny
piece
of
a
grand
land

Comparing
LoZ
Hyrule
to
AoL
Hyrule
I
assert
that
nearly
every
video
game
that
takes
place
within
Hyrule
actually
takes
place
within
the
same
vague
area
of
Hyrule
seen
in
The
Legend
of
Zelda

A
Story
and
a
Map
In
each
Zelda
video
game
we
are
provided
with
two
important
documents
a
legend
regarding
the
history
preceding
the
story
of
the
game
usually
entitled
Story
and
a
rough
map
of
the
geography
that
Link
will
discover
in
that
particular
adventure

Sometimes
these
two
artifacts
are
very
accurate
and
detailed
in
accordance
with
the
particular
adventure
at
hand
but
more
often
than
not
these
documents
are
so
vague
that
they
border
on
impressionistic

Take
for
instance
the
original
The
Legend
of
Zelda
in
the
instruction
manual
we
are
presented
with
a
highly
detailed
clay
representation
of
the
landscape
matching
almost
identically
the
geography
we
see
in
the
bit
game

The
Legend
of
Zelda
s
Hyrule
Now
consider
the
map
provided
in
Ocarina
of
Time
while
it
unquestionably
gives
an
accurate
notion
of
the
geography
it
is
by
no
means
one
to
one
indentical

Ocarina
of
Time
s
Map
Are
we
then
to
believe
that
The
Legend
of
Zelda
s
blocky
clay
map
of
Hyrule
is
more
accurate
than
Ocarina
s
merely
because
it
better
matches
the
in
game
landscape
of
its
game
Certainly
not

It
would
be
absurd
to
believe
that
geometric
series
of
square
features
could
ever
naturally
exist
as
a
landscape

We
must
then
assume
that
Hyrule
as
depicted
in
The
Legend
of
Zelda
is
an
impression
only

If
we
take
both
the
instruction
manual
map
and
in
game
landscape
as
impressionistic
for
The
Legend
of
Zelda
why
then
should
we
take
any
other
representation
of
Hyrule
any
more
literally
In
The
Adventure
of
Link
we
are
presented
with
two
seperate
maps
both
rather
vague
when
it
comes
to
comparing
the
landscape
with
that
presented
in
the
videogame
and
yet
very
different
each
from
the
other

The
two
maps
in
the
instruction
manual
for
AoL
I
take
this
varying
degree
of
vagueness
in
the
hand
drawn
cartography
along
with
the
legendary
verbage
of
the
prehistory
provided
as
story
but
that
s
another
topic
for
another
time
as
the
key
to
this
controversial
approach
to
the
accuracy
of
Hyrule
s
geography
in
comparison
to
its
cartographies

Many
insist
that
all
of
these
Hyrules
cannot
possibly
be
the
same
Hyrule
because
the
geography
is
wildly
changing
and
transforming
between
games

I
assert
that
the
geography
is
not
changing
at
all
or
at
least
not
all
that
dramatically


The
actual
problem
instead
stems
from
the
degree
of
accuracy
of
the
cartography
presented
both
in
game
and
via
the
map
provided

Ancient
Maps
of
Earth
When
we
consider
antique
maps
of
our
own
world
we
are
often
surprised
at
the
shapes
and
sizes
of
the
continents

We
wonder
at
the
seemingly
arbitrary
position
of
the
major
geographic
features
we
are
all
so
familiar
with

How
can
they
have
thought
North
America
was
so
tiny
Why
is
China
shaped
like
a
boomerang
Where
is
Greenland
Antique
Earth
Maps
These
antique
maps
display
vastly
different
shapes
and
sizes
of
landmasses
than
we
know
today

Why
the
dramatic
difference
We
know
of
course
that
these
continents
and
their
features
have
not
radically
transformed
since
that
era

The
true
transformation
is
found
in
the
improved
accuracy
of
cartography
tools
and
theories

When
we
look
at
these
antique
maps
and
see
the
shapes
and
proportions
and
complete
juxtaposition
of
features
we
do
not
assume
we
are
looking
at
a
different
Earth

No
we
understand
that
these
are
simply
archaic
understandings
of
what
Earth
was
thought
to
look
like
at
that
time

All
Hyrules
Are
One
Hyrule
The
notion
that
each
game
takes
place
in
a
different
Hyrule
is
as
absurd
to
me
as
the
Columbus
era
idea
that
the
Americas
were
actually
the
Orient

Clearly
each
videogame
deals
with
the
same
continents
collectively
known
as
Hyrule

The
majority
of
the
Zelda
games
take
place
in
the
region
I
term
Southern
Hyrule

Beginning
with
the
original
The
Legend
of
Zelda
then
A
Link
to
the
Past
Ocarina
of
Time
The
Wind
Waker
The
Minish
Cap
Four
Swords
Adventures
and
Twilight
Princess

Even
The
Adventure
of
Link
utilizes
Southern
Hyrule
albeit
limitedly
in
a
miniturized
rendition
to
give
scope
to
the
vastness
of
what
I
term
Northern
Hyrule
the
land
just
north
of
Death
Mountains
and
Eastern
Hyrule
the
continent
to
the
east
of
North
South
Hyrule


It
is
my
belief
that
Phantom
Hourglass
also
takes
place
in
a
flooded
Northern
and
Eastern
Hyrule

Three
Continents
of
Hyrule
So
how
can
all
these
different
landscapes
be
one
and
the
same
when
their
geographies
are
so
extremely
different
It
is
because
we
are
intended
to
take
these
cartographies
with
a
grain
of
salt

Sometimes
it
is
as
simple
as
up
is
NOT
north
north
is
to
the
right
as
is
the
case
in
The
Minish
Cap


Similarly
with
Ocarina
of
Time
we
find
north
to
have
shifted
about
degrees
counter
clockwise

As
long
as
we
orient
Death
Mountain
at
the
top
of
the
map
we
find
the
basic
major
features
orient
themselves
in
roughly
the
same
areas

A
Link
to
the
Past
vs

Ocarina
of
Time
The
only
thing
changing
in
the
geographies
is
the
cartographer
s
understanding
or
impression
of
it

It
is
then
unsuprising
when
we
take
a
simplified
snapshot
of
a
portion
of
Southern
Hyrule
in
each
of
these
cartographies
that
we
always
find
the
Death
Mountain
s
to
the
north
Hyrule
Castle
just
south
of
that
an
enormous
lake
to
the
east
and
an
equally
large
desert
to
the
west

Comparing
the
Hyrules
The
Moving
Village
and
Castle
What
of
Kakariko
Village
It
seems
to
be
leaping
about
the
landscape
wildly

If
the
other
major
geographic
features
are
fairly
static
map
to
map
why
then
does
it
seem
as
if
Kakariko
and
Hyrule
Castle
can
never
stay
in
the
same
place
in
each
game
This
can
be
explained
in
two
very
different
ways


As
these
maps
are
highly
impressionistic
the
village
remains
in
the
same
place
throughout
history
but
each
cartographer
s
notion
of
where
it
existed
is
different
consider
legendary
Camelot
and
the
debate
concerning
the
three
different
argued
locations
of
Cadbury
Camelford
and
Caerleon




The
Kakariko
Village
presented
in
Ocarina
of
Time
has
been
destroyed
deserted
and
thus
is
the
hidden
town
found
in
Twilight
Princess
with
a
New
Kakariko
having
been
built
further
west

Along
that
same
line
could
it
also
be
possible
that
an
earlier
Hyrule
Castle
presented
in
Ocarina
of
Time
has
been
destroyed
at
some
point
prior
to
Twilight
Princess
with
a
new
Hyrule
Castle
having
been
built
farther
east
closer
to
where
Lon
Lon
Ranch
once
stood
If
so
this
could
explain
the
ruins
found
all
throughout
Twilight
Princess
Lost
Woods
including
the
ruins
of
the
Temple
of
Time

Later
then
we
would
find
that
these
are
the
same
Lost
Woods
found
in
A
Link
to
the
Past
and
that
the
only
thing
left
of
the
ruins
of
the
Temple
of
Time
is
the
dias
and
pedestal
where
Link
discovers
the
Master
Sword

In
this
A
Link
to
the
Past
era
Hyrule
Kakariko
now
stands
just
south
of
the
ruins
of
the
Temple
of
Time
Lost
Woods
precicely
where
the
ancient
Hyrule
Castle
from
Ocarina
era
stood

Then
again
perhaps
these
are
all
simply
misinterpretations
or
slightly
different
notions
according
to
each
cartographer

The
True
Map
So
which
of
all
the
maps
is
the
most
accurate
That
remains
to
be
seen

Perhaps
they
are
each
equally
accurate
inaccurate

Or
maybe
it
stands
to
reason
that
the
most
recent
telling
Twilight
Princess
is
the
most
accurate
as
our
Nintendo
staff
cartographers
tools
advancement
of
realism
of
graphics
improve
so
too
does
the
accuracy
of
the
geography

If
the
rumors
of
Eiji
Aonuma
s
desire
to
release
a
D
A
Link
to
the
Past
ever
comes
to
fruition
it
will
be
exciting
to
see
how
this
cartography
compares
to
that
of
it
s
bit
predecesor

One
thing
remains
certain
however
regardless
of
its
geography
Hyrule
never
ceases
to
prove
full
of
fun
and
adventure

And
really
that
s
all
that
matters
in
the
end

The
Legend
of
Zelda
a
is
a
media
franchise
created
by
the
Japanese
game
designers
Shigeru
Miyamoto
and
Takashi
Tezuka

It
is
primarily
developed
and
published
by
Nintendo
some
portable
installments
and
re
releases
have
been
outsourced
to
Flagship
Vanpool
Grezzo
and
Tantalus
Media

The
series
centers
on
the
various
incarnations
of
Link
a
courageous
young
man
of
the
elf
like
Hylian
race
and
Princess
Zelda
a
princess
within
the
bloodline
of
the
goddess
Hylia
as
they
fight
to
save
the
land
of
Hyrule
from
Ganon
an
evil
warlord
turned
demon
king
who
is
the
principal
antagonist
of
the
series

Ganon
wishes
to
use
the
Triforce
a
sacred
relic
left
behind
by
the
three
goddesses
that
created
Hyrule
to
remake
the
world
in
his
own
dark
image

When
gathered
together
the
power
of
the
Triforce
can
grant
any
wish
its
user
desires
but
if
someone
with
a
heart
that
does
not
possess
a
balance
of
the
three
virtues
of
Power
Courage
and
Wisdom
attempts
to
touch
the
Triforce
it
will
split
into
three
triangles
and
bond
with
three
people
whose
hearts
embody
the
required
virtue

Although
their
personalities
and
backstory
differ
from
game
to
game
the
incarnations
of
Link
and
Zelda
often
have
many
traits
in
common
such
as
Link
often
being
left
handed
and
clad
in
green
and
Zelda
being
associated
with
wisdom
light
and
prophecy

While
the
conflict
with
Ganon
serves
as
a
backbone
for
the
series
some
games
have
featured
other
settings
and
antagonists
with
Link
traveling
or
being
sent
to
these
other
lands
in
their
time
of
need

Since
The
Legend
of
Zelda
was
released
in
the
series
has
expanded
to
include
entries
on
all
of
Nintendo
s
major
game
consoles
as
well
as
a
number
of
spin
offs

An
American
animated
TV
series
based
on
the
games
aired
in
and
manga
adaptations
commissioned
by
Nintendo
have
been
produced
in
Japan
since


The
Legend
of
Zelda
is
one
of
Nintendo
s
most
successful
franchises
several
of
its
entries
are
considered
among
the
greatest
video
games
of
all
time

Rupees

in
the
series
Gameplay
of
The
Legend
of
Zelda
games
feature
a
mix
of
puzzles
action
adventure
and
exploration

These
elements
have
remained
constant
throughout
the
series
with
refinements
and
additions
featured
in
each
new
game

Later
games
in
the
series
include
stealth
gameplay
where
the
player
must
avoid
enemies
while
proceeding
through
a
level
as
well
as
racing
elements

Although
the
games
can
be
beaten
with
a
minimal
amount
of
exploration
and
side
quests
the
player
is
frequently
rewarded
with
helpful
items
or
increased
abilities
for
solving
puzzles
or
exploring
hidden
areas

Some
items
are
consistent
and
appear
many
times
throughout
the
series
such
as
bombs
and
bomb
flowers
which
can
be
used
both
as
weapons
and
to
open
blocked
or
hidden
doorways
boomerangs
which
can
kill
or
paralyze
enemies
keys
for
locked
doors
magic
swords
shields
and
bows
and
arrows
while
others
are
unique
to
a
single
game

Though
the
games
contain
role
playing
elements
Zelda
II
The
Adventure
of
Link
is
the
only
one
to
include
an
experience
system
they
emphasize
straightforward
hack
and
slash
style
combat
over
the
strategic
turn
based
or
active
time
combat
of
series
like
Final
Fantasy

The
game
s
role
playing
elements
however
have
led
to
much
debate
over
whether
or
not
the
Zelda
games
should
be
classified
as
action
role
playing
games
a
genre
on
which
the
series
has
had
a
strong
influence

Miyamoto
himself
disagreed
with
the
role
playing
label
and
classified
Zelda
as
a
real
time
adventure
game
he
said
that
he
was
not
interested
in
systems
where
everything
in
the
game
is
decided
by
stats
and
numbers
but
wanted
to
preserve
as
much
of
that
live
feeling
as
possible
and
felt
that
action
games
are
better
suited
to
convey
to
players

The
Legend
of
Zelda
often
includes
nonlinear
gameplay
and
varying
environments
in
an
explorable
world
similar
to
this
illustration

Every
game
in
the
main
Zelda
series
has
consisted
of
three
principal
areas
an
overworld
which
connects
all
other
areas
in
which
movement
is
multidirectional
allowing
the
player
some
degree
of
freedom
of
action
areas
of
interaction
with
other
characters
merely
caves
or
hidden
rooms
in
the
first
game
but
expanding
to
entire
towns
and
cities
in
subsequent
games
in
which
the
player
gains
special
items
or
advice
can
purchase
equipment
or
complete
side
quests
and
dungeons
areas
of
labyrinthine
layout
usually
underground
comprising
a
wide
range
of
difficult
enemies
bosses
and
items

Each
dungeon
usually
has
one
major
item
inside
which
can
be
essential
for
solving
many
of
the
puzzles
within
that
dungeon
and
often
plays
a
crucial
role
in
defeating
that
dungeon
s
boss
as
well
as
progressing
through
the
game

In
nearly
every
Zelda
game
navigating
a
dungeon
is
aided
by
locating
a
map
which
reveals
its
layout
and
a
magic
compass
which
reveals
the
location
of
significant
and
smaller
items
such
as
keys
and
equipment

In
later
games
the
dungeon
includes
a
special
big
key
that
will
unlock
the
door
to
battle
the
dungeon
s
boss
enemy
and
open
the
item
chest

In
most
Zelda
games
the
player
s
HP
or
life
meter
is
represented
by
a
line
of
hearts
each
heart
typically
representing
two
hit
points

At
the
start
of
the
game
the
player
only
has
three
hearts
players
can
increase
their
max
hearts
by
finding
heart
shaped
crystals
called
Heart
Containers


Full
heart
containers
are
usually
received
at
the
end
of
dungeons
and
dropped
by
dungeon
bosses

Smaller
Pieces
of
Heart
are
awarded
for
completing
side
quests
or
found
hidden
around
the
game
world
in
various
places
and
require
a
certain
number
usually
four
to
form
a
full
heart
container

Health
can
be
replenished
by
picking
up
hearts
left
by
defeated
enemies
or
destroyed
objects
consuming
items
such
as
potions
or
food
or
going
to
a
Great
Fairy
Fountain
to
have
the
Great
Fairy
heal
Link
completely

Occasionally
the
player
will
find
fairies
hidden
in
specific
locations
these
fairies
can
either
heal
Link
immediately
or
be
kept
in
empty
bottles
and
will
revive
the
player
the
next
time
they
die

The
games
pioneered
a
number
of
features
that
were
to
become
industry
standards

The
original
Legend
of
Zelda
was
the
first
console
game
with
a
save
function
that
enabled
players
to
stop
playing
and
then
resume
later

The
Legend
of
Zelda
Ocarina
of
Time
introduced
a
targeting
system
that
let
the
player
lock
the
camera
on
to
enemy
or
friendly
non
player
characters
which
simplified
D

Shigeru
Miyamoto
series
creator
was
inspired
by
the
hillsides
forests
and
caves
surrounding
his
childhood
home
in
Sonobe
Japan

The
Legend
of
Zelda
was
principally
inspired
by
Shigeru
Miyamoto
s
explorations
as
a
young
boy
in
the
hillsides
forests
and
caves
surrounding
his
childhood
home
in
Sonobe
Japan
where
he
ventured
into
forests
with
secluded
lakes
caves
and
rural
villages

According
to
Miyamoto
one
of
his
most
memorable
experiences
was
the
discovery
of
a
cave
entrance
in
the
middle
of
the
woods

After
some
hesitation
he
apprehensively
entered
the
cave
and
explored
its
depths
with
the
aid
of
a
lantern

Miyamoto
has
referred
to
the
creation
of
the
Zelda
games
as
an
attempt
to
bring
to
life
a
miniature
garden
for
players
to
play
with
in
each
game
of
the
series

The
story
and
setting
were
developed
by
Takashi
Tezuka

Seeking
to
create
a
fairytale
adventure
game
Tezuka
drew
inspirations
from
fantasy
books
such
as
J

R

R

Tolkien
s
The
Lord
of
the
Rings

According
to
Keiji
Terui
who
wrote
the
backstory
in
the
first
game
s
manual
the
location
named
Death
Mountain
was
initially
a
working
title
for
the
legend
of
the
Triforce
which
was
written
with
inspirations
from
the
battles
of
medieval
Europe

The
Master
Sword
was
introduced
as
Excalibur
in
the
French
version
of
A
Link
to
the
Past
which
is
regarded
as
reminiscent
to
the
legend
of
King
Arthur

Celtic
mythology
inspired
the
name
of
Link
s
steed
Epona
based
on
Epona
Celtic
goddess
of
fertility

Hearing
of
American
novelist
socialite
and
painter
Zelda
Fitzgerald
Miyamoto
thought
the
name
sounded
pleasant
and
significant


Paying
tribute
he
chose
to
name
the
princess
after
her
and
titled
it
The
Legend
of
Zelda

Link
and
the
fairy
were
inspired
by
Peter
Pan
and
Tinker
Bell

When
the
series
made
the
transition
to
D
the
combat
system
of
Ocarina
of
Time
was
based
on
the
chanbara
samurai
style
of
Japanese
sword
fighting

Games
in
The
Legend
of
Zelda
series
frequently
feature
in
game
musical
instruments
particularly
in
musical
puzzles
which
are
widespread

Often
instruments
trigger
game
events
for
example
the
recorder
in
The
Legend
of
Zelda
can
reveal
secret
areas
as
well
as
warp
Link
to
the
dungeon
entrances

This
warping
with
music
feature
has
also
been
used
in
A
Link
to
the
Past
and
Link
s
Awakening

In
Ocarina
of
Time
playing
instruments
is
a
core
part
of
the
game
with
the
player
needing
to
play
the
instrument
through
the
use
of
the
game
controller
to
succeed

Ocarina
of
Time
is
one
of
the
first
contemporary
non
dance
title
s
to
feature
music
making
as
part
of
its
gameplay
using
music
as
a
heuristic
device
and
requiring
the
player
to
utilise
songs
to
progress
in
the
game
a
game
mechanic
that
is
also
present
in
Majora
s
Mask

The
Legend
of
Zelda
Theme
is
a
recurring
piece
of
music
that
was
created
for
the
first
game

The
composer
and
sound
director
of
the
series
Koji
Kondo
initially
planned
to
use
Maurice
Ravel
s
Bol
ro
as
the
game
s
title
theme
but
was
forced
to
change
it
when
he
learned
late
in
the
game
s
development
cycle
that
the
copyright
for
the
orchestral
piece
had
not
yet
expired

As
a
result
Kondo
wrote
a
new
arrangement
of
the
overworld
theme
within
one
day

Up
until
Breath
of
the
Wild
the
Legend
of
Zelda
series
avoided
using
voice
acting
in
speaking
roles
relying
instead
on
written
dialogue

Series
producer
Eiji
Aonuma
previously
stated
that
as
Link
is
entirely
mute
having
the
other
characters
speak
while
Link
remains
silent
would
be
off
putting


Instead
of
theme
music
for
different
locations
Breath
of
the
Wild
plays
natural
ambience
around
the
player
as
main
sounds
in
addition
to
some
minimalist
piano
music

The
Legend
of
Zelda
takes
place
predominantly
in
a
medieval
Western
Europe
inspired
fantasy
world
called
Hyrule
which
has
developed
a
deep
history
and
wide
geography
over
the
series
s
many
releases

Much
of
the
backstory
of
the
creation
of
Hyrule
was
revealed
in
the
games
A
Link
to
the
Past
Ocarina
of
Time
The
Wind
Waker
Twilight
Princess
Skyward

and

Hyrule
s
principal
inhabitants
are
pointy
eared
elf
like
humanoids
called
Hylians
which
include
the
player
character
Link
and
the
eponymous
princess
Zelda

The
fictional
universe
established
by
the
Zelda
games
sets
the
stage
for
each
adventure

Some
games
take
place
in
different
lands
with
their
own
back
stories

Hytopia
is
a
connected
kingdom
Labrynna
and
Holodrum
are
different
countries
separate
from
the
Kingdom
of
Hyrule
Termina
and
Lorule
serve
as
parallel
worlds
and

Hyrule
that
appears
to
be
part
of
a
dream

Story
px
Trifuerza
svg
png
The
Triforce
is
represented
as
three
conjoined
golden
triangles

According
to
the
in
game
backstories
the
world
of
Hyrule
was
created
by
the
three
golden
goddesses
Din
Farore
and
Nayru

Before
departing
the
goddesses
left
a
sacred
artifact
called
the
Triforce
which
could
grant
powers
to
the
user

It
physically
manifests
itself
as
three
golden
triangles
in
which
each
embodies
one
of
the
goddesses
virtues
Power
Courage
and
Wisdom

However
because
the
Triforce
has
no
will
of
its
own
and
it
can
not
judge
between
good
and
evil
it
will
grant
any
wish
indiscriminately

Because
of
this
it
was
placed
within
an
alternate
world
called
the
Sacred
Realm
or
the
Golden
Land
until
one
worthy
of
its
power
and
has
balanced
virtues
of
Power
Wisdom
and
Courage
in
their
heart
could
obtain
it
in
its
entirety

If
a
person
is
not
of
a
balanced
heart
the
triforce
part
that
the
user
mostly
believes
in
will
stay
with
that
person
and
the
remainder
will
seek
out
others

In
order
to
master
and
control
the
triforce
as
a
whole
the
user
must
get
the
other
parts
found
in
other
individuals
and
bring
them
together
to
reunite
them

The
Sacred
Realm
can
itself
be
affected
by
the
heart
of
those
who
enter
it
those
who
are
pure
will
make
it
a
paradise
while
those
who
are
evil
will
transform
it
into
a
dark
realm

In
Skyward
Sword
the
Triforce
was
sought
by
the
Demon
King
Demise
an
eternal
being
that
had
conquered
time
itself

After
a
long
battle
against
the
goddess
Hylia
guardian
of
the
Triforce
Demise
was
sealed
away
within
her
temple

Hylia
placing
the
Hylians
on
a
floating
island
in
the
sky
called
Skyloft
to
protect
them
orchestrated
a
means
to
stop
the
demon
from
escaping
creating
the
Goddess
Sword
later
becoming
the
Master
Sword
for
her
chosen
hero
and
discarding
her
divinity
to
be
reborn
among
the
people
of
Skyloft

In
time
Zelda
and
Link
the
reborn
Hylia
and
her
predestined
warrior
enacted
the
goddess
s
plan
and
Demise
was
destroyed
but
he
vowed
that
his
rage
would
be
reborn
and
forever
plague
those
descended
from
Link
and
Zelda

Following
the
establishment
of
Hyrule
Kingdom
Demise
s
prophecy
came
to
fruition
in
Ocarina
of
Time
when
Ganondorf
s
attempt
to
get
the
Triforce
scattered
it
with
him
gaining
the
Triforce
of
Power

The
Triforce
of
Wisdom
ended
up
with
the
Hylian
princesses
descended
from
Zelda
each
named
after
her
while
the
Triforce
of
Courage
is
passed
to
a
youth
named
Link
across
generations

While
the
Triforces
of
Power
and
Wisdom
have
been
part
of
the
series
since
the
original
The
Legend
of
Zelda
it
was
in
Zelda
II
The
Adventure
of
Link
that
the
Triforce
of
Courage
was
introduced
being
obtained
by
Link
at
the
end
of
his
quest

The
Triforce
or
even
a
piece
of
it
is
not
always
distributed
as
a
whole

Such
as
in
The
Wind
Waker
Link
must
find
all
the
pieces
called
Triforce
Shards
of
the
Triforce
of
Courage
before
he
can
return
to
Hyrule

Even
in
the
original
The
Legend
of
Zelda
Zelda
breaks
her
Triforce
of
Wisdom
into
pieces
for
Link
to
find
before
she
was
captured
by
Ganon

The
chronology
of

was
a
subject
of
much
debate
among
fans
until
an
official
timeline
was
released
within
the

s
book
first
released
in
Japan
in
December


Prior
to
its
release
in
a
interview
series
creator
Shigeru
Miyamoto
confirmed
the
existence
of
an
internal
document
which
connected
all
the
games
with

producer
Eiji
Aonuma

revealing
in
the

nature
of
this

only
Miyamoto

Ocarina
of

a
prequel
to
A
Link
to
the
Past
and
takes
the
story
many
centuries
back
according
to
character
designer
Satoru
Takizawa
it
was
meant
to
implicitly
tell
the
story
of
the
Imprisoning

take
place
after
all
previous
games
in
the
series
without
specifying
a
direct
connection
to
any
of
the
three
timeline
branches

In
the
early
s
Nintendo
of
America
released
a
timeline
on
the
official
website
of
the
series
as
one
of
the
possible
interpretation
of
the
events
from
all
entries
released
up
to
that
point
featuring
a
single
protagonist
named
Link
the
Hero
of
Time
from
its
first
adventure
in
Ocarina
of
Time

It
was
followed
by
Majora
s
Mask
A
Link
to
the
Past
Oracle
of
Seasons
Oracle
of
Ages
the
original
The
Legend
of
Zelda
Zelda
II
The
Adventure
of
Link
and
finally
Link
s
Awakening

In
series
translator
Daniel
Owsen
revealed
that
at
one
point
his
coworkers
at
Nintendo
of
America
and
him
conceived
another
complete
timeline
and
intended
to
make
it
available
online
but
the
Japanese
series
developers
rejected
the
idea
so
that
the
placement
of
each
game
would
be
kept
open
to
the
imagination
of
the
players

On
December
to
celebrate
th
anniversary
of
the
series
the
Hyrule
Historia
art
book
was
published
by
Shogakukan
which
contained
an
official
timeline
of
the
fictional
chronology
of
the
series
up
to
that
point

This
timeline
subsequently
posits
that
following
Ocarina
of
Time
it
splits
into
three
alternate
routes
in
one
Ganon
is
not
defeated
leading
into
the
Imprisoning
War
and
A
Link
to
the
Past
Oracle
of
Seasons
and
Oracle
of
Ages
Link
s
Awakening
A
Link
Between
Worlds
Tri
Force
Heroes
and
Echoes
of
Wisdom
were
released
after
the
timeline
The
Legend
of
Zelda
and
The
Adventure
of
Link

The
second
and
third
where
Ganon
is
defeated
by
Link
lead
to
a
split
timeline
between
his
childhood
where
Zelda
sends
him
back
in
time
so
he
can
use
the
wisdom
he
has
gained
to
warn
young
Zelda
of
the
horrifying
fate
of
Hyrule
and
adulthood
where
adult
Zelda
lives
on
to
try
and
rebuild
her
kingdom


His
childhood
continues
with
Majora
s
Mask
followed
by
Twilight
Princess
and
Four
Swords
Adventures

The
timeline
from
his
adult
life
continues
into
Wind
Waker
Phantom
Hourglass
and
Spirit
Tracks

In
Nintendo
revealed
Breath
of
the
Wild
s
timeline
placement
after
all
previous
games
in
the
series
without
specifying
a
connection
to
any
of
the
three
timeline
branches

Aonuma
and
Breath
of
the
Wild
director
Hidemaro
Fujibayashi
justified
the
vague
placement
with
the
previous
idea
of
keeping
it
open
to
players
imaginations

Nintendo
moved
Link
s
Awakening
to
take
place
before
Oracle
of
Seasons
and
Oracle
of
Ages

In
Nintendo
released
Hyrule
Warriors
Age
of
Calamity
a
gameplay
wise
sequel
to
the
spin
off
game
Hyrule
Warriors
marketed
as
a
prequel
to
Breath
of
the
Wild
being
set
years
before
but
the
events
of
Age
of
Calamity
diverged
from
the
backstory
established
in
Breath
of
the
Wild
creating
an
alternate
timeline
separate
from
it

Main
article
Link
The
Legend
of
Zelda
The
central
protagonist
of
The
Legend
of
Zelda
series
Link
is
the
name
of
various
young
male
Hylians
who
characteristically
wear
a
green
tunic
and
a
pointed
cap
and
are
the
bearers
of
the
Triforce
of
Courage

In
most
games
the
player
can
give
Link
a
different
name
before
the
start
of
the
adventure
and
he
will
be
referred
by
that
given
name
throughout
by
the
non
player
characters
NPCs


Miyamoto
said
in
a
interview
that
he
named
the
protagonist
Link
because
the
character
is
was
supposed
to
be
the
link
between
the
player
and
the
game
world

The
various
Links
each
have
a
special
title
such
as
Hero
of
Time
Hero
of
Winds
or
Hero
of
the
Wild


Like
many
silent
protagonists
in
video
games
Link
does
not
speak
only
producing
grunts
yells
etc

but
he
is
not
mute
dialogue
from
him
is
referenced
second
hand
by
in
game
characters
despite
not
being
seen
or
heard
by
the
player

Link
is
depicted
as
a
silent
protagonist
so
that
the
audience
is
able
to
have
their
own
thoughts
as
to
how
their
Link
would
answer
the
characters
instead
of
him
having
scripted
responses

Princess
Zelda
Main
article
Princess
Zelda
Princess
Zelda
is
the
princess
of
Hyrule
and
the
guardian
of
the
Triforce
of
Wisdom

Her
name
is
present
in
many
of
her
female
ancestors
and
descendants

While
most
games
require
Link
to
save
Zelda
from
Ganon
she
sometimes
plays
a
supporting
role
in
battle
using
magical
powers
and
weapons
such
as
Light
Arrows
to
aid
Link

With
the
exception
of
the
CD
i
games
she
was
not
playable
in
the
main
series
until
Spirit
Tracks
where
she
becomes
a
spirit
and
can
possess
a
Phantom
Knight
that
can
be
controlled
by
the
player

Zelda
appears
under
various
other
aliases
and
alter
egos
including
Sheik
in
Ocarina
of
Time
and
Tetra
in
The
Wind
Waker
and
Phantom
Hourglass


In
Skyward
Sword
it
is
revealed
that
the
Zelda
of
that
game
is
a
reincarnation
of
the
goddess
Hylia
whose
power
flows
through
the
royal
bloodline

The
name
Zelda
derives
from
the
American
novelist
Zelda
Fitzgerald

Ganon
Main
article
Ganon
Ganon
also
known
as
Ganondorf
in
his
humanoid
form
is
the
main
antagonist
and
the
final
boss
in
the
majority
of
The
Legend
of
Zelda
games

In
the
series
Ganondorf
is
the
leader
of
a
race
of
desert
brigands
called
the
Gerudo
which
consists
entirely
of
female
warriors
save
for
one
man
born
every
one
hundred
years

He
is
significantly
taller
than
other
human
NPCs
but
his
looks
vary
between
games
often
taking
the
form
of
a
monstrous
anthropomorphic
boar

His
specific
motives
vary
from
game
to
game
but
most
often
his
plans
include
him
kidnapping
Princess
Zelda
and
planning
to
achieve
domination
of
Hyrule
and
presumably
the
world
beyond
it

To
this
end
he
seeks
the
Triforce
a
powerful
magical
relic

He
often
possesses
a
portion
of
the
Triforce
called
the
Triforce
of
Power
which
gives
him
great
strength
but
it
is
often
not
enough
to
accomplish
his
ends
leading
him
to
hunt
the
remaining
Triforce
pieces

Unlike
Link
Zelda
and
most
other
recurring
characters
he
is
actually
the
same
person
in
every
game
with
the
exception
of
Four
Swords
Adventures
where
he
is
a
reincarnation
of
the
original

In
each
game
the
battles
with
him
are
different
and
he
fights
using
different
styles

The
game
Skyward
Sword
indicates
that
Ganon
is
a
reincarnation
of
an
evil
deity
known
as
Demise

was
retained
for

was
released
first
in

Zelda
was
developed
in

by
Nintendo
the
subsequent
two
LCD
games
were
developed
by
third

by
Nintendo

In
October
The
Legend
of
Zelda
was
developed
by
Nelsonic
as
part
of
its
Game

was
an

of
a
compromise
between

and
Nintendo
after
the
companies
failed
to
develop
a

peripheral
for
the

the

Nintendo
never

them
in

and
they
are
considered
to
be
in
a

are
widely
acknowledged
to
be
the
worst

in

Ocarina
of
Time
released
in
for
the
Nintendo
was
the
first
D
game
in
the
series

After
five
years
without
a
new
game
the
series
made
the
transition
to
D
with
Ocarina
of
Time
for
the
Nintendo
which
was
released
in
November


This
game
initially
known
as
Zelda
retains
the
core
gameplay
of
the
previous
D
games
and
was
very
successful
commercially
and
critically
considered
by
many
critics
and
gamers
to
be
the
best
video
game
of
all
time
and
ranking
highly
on
IGN
and
EGM
s
greatest
games
of
all
time
lists
as
well
as
scoring
perfect
scores
in
several
video
game
publications

In
February
it
was
ranked
by
Nintendo
Power
as
the
best
game
released
for
a
Nintendo
console

The
game
was
originally
developed
for
the
poorly
selling
Japanese
only
DD
but
was
converted
to
cartridge
format
when
the
DD
hardware
was
delayed

A
new
gameplay
mechanic
lock
on
targeting
is
used
in
the
game
which
focuses
the
camera
on
a
nearby
target
and
alters
the
player
s
actions
relative
to
that
target

Such
mechanics
allow
precise
sword
fighting
in
a
D
space

The
game
heavily
uses
context
sensitive
button
play
which
enabled
the
player
to
control
various
actions
with
Link
using
only
one
button
on
the
Nintendo
s
controller

Each
action
was
handled
slightly
differently
but
all
used
the
A
button
to
perform

For
instance
standing
next
to
a
block
and
pressing
A
made
Link
grab
it
enabling
him
to
push
pull
it
but
moving
forwards
into
a
block
and
pressing
A
allowed
Link
to
climb
the
block

The
game
featured
the
first
appearance
of
Link
s
horse
Epona
allowing
Link
to
travel
quickly
across
land
and
fire
arrows
from
horseback

Those
who
preordered
the
game
received
a
gold
colored
cartridge
in
a
limited
edition
box
with
a
golden
plastic
card
affixed
reading
Collector
s
Edition


In
some
stores
that
had
this
Collector
s
Edition
quickly
sell
out
a
small
and
rare
Zelda
pin
was
given
instead

It
is
the
sword
and
shield
emblem
with
Zelda
written
on
it

Very
few
of
them
are
known
to
remain

Ocarina
of
Time
was
re
released
on
the
GameCube
in
when
it
was
offered
as
a
pre
order
incentive
for
The
Wind
Waker
in
the
U
S

Canada
and
Japan

It
includes
the
cancelled
DD
expansion
for
Ocarina
of
Time
known
as
Ura
Zelda
during
development

Named
Ocarina
of
Time
Master
Quest
the
game
was
given
reorganized
dungeon
layouts
for
greater
difficulty

Europe
continued
to
receive
this
Two
Game
Bonus
Disc
free
in
every
copy
of
The
Wind
Waker
except
for
the
discounted
Player
s
Choice
version

Ocarina
of
Time
was
available
through
the
Wii
s
Virtual
Console
service

Nintendo
re
released
it
for
the
Wii
U
Virtual
Console
in
July


Ocarina
of
Time
D
for
the
DS
featuring
remade
graphics
and
stereoscopic
D
was
released
in
mid
June


Ocarina
of
Time
has
been
made
available
on
the
higher
tier
of
Nintendo
Switch
Online
in
HD
resolution

Ocarina
of
Time
s
follow
up
Majora
s
Mask
was
released
in
April


It
uses
the
same
D
game
engine
as
the
previous
game
and
added
a
time
based
concept
in
which
Link
the
protagonist
relives
the
events
of
three
days
as
many
times
as
needed
to
complete
the
game
s
objectives

It
was
originally
called
Zelda
Gaiden
a
Japanese
title
that
translates
as
Zelda
Side
story

Gameplay
changed
significantly
in
addition
to
the
time
limit
Link
can
use
masks
to
transform
into
creatures
with
unique
abilities

While
Majora
s
Mask
retains
the
graphical
style
of
Ocarina
of
Time
it
is
also
a
departure
particularly
in
its
atmosphere

It
features
motion
blur
unlike
its
predecessor

The
game
is
darker
in
tone
dealing
with
death
and
tragedy
in
a
manner
not
previously
seen
in
the
series
and
has
a
sense
of
impending
doom
as
a
large
moon
slowly
descends
upon
the
land
of
Termina
to
destroy
all
life

All
copies
of
Majora
s
Mask
are
gold
cartridges

A
limited
Collector
s
Edition
lenticular
cartridge
label
was
offered
as
the
pre
order
incentive

Copies
of
the
game
that
are
not
collector
s
editions
feature
a
normal
sticker
cartridge
label

Majora
s
Mask
was
available
on
the
Wii
and
Wii
U
Virtual
Console
catalogues

The
Legend
of
Zelda
Majora
s
Mask
D
was
released
for
DS
in
North
America
Europe
Japan
and
Australia
in
February


The
Nintendo
version
was
added
to
Nintendo
Switch
Online
in
February
with
this
all
of
the
D
games
in
the
series
have
been
re
released
in
HD
resolution

Oracle
of
Seasons
and
Oracle
of
Ages
were
released
simultaneously
for
the
Game
Boy
Color
in
and
interact
using
passwords
or
a
Game
Link
Cable

After
one
game
has
been
completed
the
player
is
given
a
password
that
allows
the
other
game
to
be
played
as
a
sequel

They
were
developed
by
Flagship
in
conjunction
with
Nintendo
with
supervision
from
Miyamoto

After
the
team
experimented
with
porting
the
original
The
Legend
of
Zelda
to
the
Game
Boy
Color
they
decided
to
make
an
original
trilogy
to
be
called
the
Triforce
Series


When
the
password
system
linking
the
three
games
proved
too
troublesome
the
concept
was
reduced
to
two
games
at
Miyamoto
s
suggestion

These
two
games
became
Oracle
of
Ages
which
is
more
puzzle
based
and
Oracle
of
Seasons
which
is
more
action
oriented

Both
titles
were
later
released
on
the
DS
Virtual
Console
and
Nintendo
Switch
Online

The
Wind
Waker
released
in
for
the
GameCube
was
the
first
game
in
the
series
featuring
cel
shading

When
Nintendo
revealed
the
GameCube
on
August
the
day
before
Nintendo
s
Space
World
exposition
a
software
demonstration
showed
a
realistically
styled
real
time
duel
between
Ganondorf
and
Link

Fans
and
the
media
speculated
that
the
battle
might
be
from
a
Zelda
game
in
development
at
the
time

At
Space
World
Nintendo
showed
a
cel
shaded
Zelda
game
later
released
as
The
Wind
Waker
in
December


Due
to
poor
reception
nothing
further
was
shown
until
a
playable
demonstration
was
ready

Miyamoto
felt
The
Wind
Waker
would
extend
Zelda
s
reach
to
all
ages


The
gameplay
centers
on
controlling
wind
with
a
baton
called
the
Wind
Waker
and
sailing
a
small
boat
around
an
island
filled
ocean
retaining
similar

as
the
previous
D
games
in

on
the
handheld
Four
Swords
Four
Swords
Adventures
was
another
deviation
from
previous
Zelda
gameplay
focusing
on
level
based
and
multiplayer
gameplay

The
game
contains
levels
and
a
map
screen
there
is
no
connecting
overworld

For
multiplayer
features
each
player
must
use
a
Game
Boy
Advance
system
linked
to
the
GameCube
via
a
Nintendo
GameCube
Game
Boy
Advance
link
cable

The
game
features
a
single
player
campaign
in
which
using
a
Game

is
optional

Four
Swords
Adventures
includes
two
gameplay
modes
Hyrulean
Adventure
with
a
plot
and
gameplay
similar
to
other
Zelda
games
and
Shadow
Battle
in
which
multiple
Links
played
by
multiple
players
battle
each
other

The
Japanese
and
Korean
versions
include
an
exclusive
third
segment
Navi
Trackers
originally
designed
as
the
stand
alone
game
Tetra
s
Trackers
which
contains
spoken
dialogue
for
most
of

characters
unlike
other
games
in
The
Legend

in
Japan
and

he
can
see

parts
of
a
dungeon

a
different
perspective
and
enter
areas
through
otherwise
impassable
openings

and
later
in
December
as
the
last
Nintendo
published
game
for
the
GameCube
the
console
for
which
it
was
originally
developed

The
Wii
version
features
motion
controls
and
a
reversed
world
where
everything
that
is
in
the
west
on
the
GameCube
is
in
the
east
on
the
Wii

The
display
is
mirrored
in
order
to
make
Link
right
handed
to
make
use
of
the
Wii
Remote
feel
more
natural
for
the
majority
of
players

The
game
chronicles
the
struggle
of
a
young
adult
Link
to
confront
the
troubles
of
the
Twilight
Realm
a
mysterious
force
that
appears
around
and
interacts
with
Hyrule

When
he
enters
this
realm
he
is
transformed
into
a
wolf
and
loses
the
ability
to
use
his
sword
shield
or
other
items
but
gains
other
abilities
such
as
sharpened

from
his
new
form

Other
games
Cancelled
games
Throughout
the
lifespan
of
The
Legend
of

series
a
number
of
games
including
main
series
games
as
well
as
re
releases
and
spin
offs
in
varying
states
of
completeness
have
had
their
releases
cancelled

Perhaps
the
earliest
of
these
was
Gottlieb
s
The
Legend
of
Zelda
Pinball
Machine
cancelled
in


After
securing
a
license
from
Nintendo
to
produce
two
Nintendo
franchise
based
pinball
machines
pinball
designer
Jon
Norris
was
tasked
with
designing
the
table

Before
it
was
completed
Gottlieb
decided
to
repurpose
the
game
with
an
American
Gladiators
theme

Licensing
for
this
version
ultimately
fell
through
and
the
game
was
released
as
simply
Gladiators
in
November


In
Nintendo
cancelled
Ura
Zelda
the
Ocarina
of
Time
expansion
disk
for
the
DD
due
to
poor
sales
figures
for
the
DD
peripheral

In
Nintendo
released
a
GameCube
bonus
disc
called
The
Legend
of
Zelda
Ocarina
of
Time
Master
Quest

It
contains
emulated
versions
of
Ocarina
of
Time
and
Ocarina
of
Time
Master
Quest
which
Aonuma
and
Miyamoto
each
confirmed
is
Ura
Zelda

In
under
license
from
Nintendo
Capcom
cancelled
the
release
of
The
Legend
of
Zelda
Mystical
Seed
of
Courage
for
Game
Boy
Color

Working
with
Capcom
s
subsidiary
Flagship
Yoshiki
Okamoto
was
originally
tasked
with
designing
a
series
of
three
Zelda
games
for
the
Game
Boy
Color

Referred
to
as
the
Triforce
Series
the
games
were
known
as
The
Legend
of
Zelda
The
Mysterious
Acorn
Chapter
of
Power
Chapter
of
Wisdom
and
Chapter
of
Courage
in
Japan
and
The
Legend
of
Zelda
Mystical
Seed
of
Power
Mystical
Seed
of
Wisdom
and
Mystical
Seed
of
Courage
in
the
US

The
games
were
to
interact
using
a
password
system
but
the
limitations
of
this
system
and
the
difficulty
of
coordinating
three
games
proved
too
complicated
so
the
team
scaled
back
to
two
games
at

of
the
game
BS

and
December
could
be
considered

the
fact
that
they
star
the
Hero
of

portrayed
by

Film
In
Imagi
Animation
Studios
which
had
provided
the
animation
for
TMNT
and
Astro
Boy
created
a
pitch
reel
for
a
computer
animated
The
Legend

film

Nintendo
did
not
accept
the
studio
s
offer
due
to
the
memory
of
the
failure
of
the
live
action
film
adaptation
of
Super
Mario
Bros

In
Aonuma
said
that
if
the
development
of
a
film
began
the
company
would
want
to
use
the
opportunity
to
embrace
audience
interaction
in
some
capacity

In

it
was
said
that
Nintendo
was
close
to
closing
a
deal
with
Illumination
and
Universal
Pictures
to
produce
a
film
adaptation
of
the
franchise
following
the
success
of
their
film
The
Super
Mario
Bros

Movie
but
Illumination
CEO
Chris
Meledandri
denied
these
reports
later
that
month

By
November
Nintendo
was
developing
a
live
action
Legend
of
Zelda
film
with
Sony
Pictures
which
will
co
finance
and
distribute
the
project
worldwide

Wes
Ball
has
been
attached
to
direct
the
film
and
Shigeru
Miyamoto
and
Avi
Arad
will
be
producing
alongside
Ball
and
his
producing
partner
Joe
Hartwick
Jr

through
their
Oddball
Entertainment
company

Although
the
casting
had
not
been
announced
Patricia
Summersett
who
had
previously
done
voice
work
for
Princess
Zelda
said
that
she
would
like
to
reprise
her
role
for

The
title
that
Nintendo
chose
for
the
series
has
led
to
a
lot
of
confusion
even
now
with
people
still
confusing
Zelda
and
Link

Basically
through
the
long
and
short
of
it
the
primary
focus
of
every
game
is
on
Link
so
the
title
does
seem
a
little
off
but
Legend
of
Link
doesn
t
quite
have
the
same
ring
to
it
not
to
mention
the
confusion
of
LoL
and
lol
they
somehow
preempted
that
by
years
But
Zelda
is
just
as
much
an
important
character
in
the
series
as
Link
and
even
Ganon
or
Ganondorf
so
does
the
title
link
itself
to
more
than
just
a
character

The
first
The
Legend
of
Zelda
game
was
focused
on
rescuing
Zelda
from
the
clutches
of
Gannon
as
his
name
was
originally
spelt

The
decision
to
name
the
game
after
the
princess
instead
of
the
player
is
probably
due
in
large
part
to
the
ability
to
pick
your
own
name

The
argument
over
many
years
for
Link
to
have
no
voice
was
that
the
player
is
meant
to
feel
like
they
aren
t
controlling
another
character
but
instead
are
a
part
of
the
game

In
the
immediate
sequel
they
dropped
The
Legend
and
opted
for
Zelda
II
The
Adventure
of
Link

This
sequel
wasn
t
as
well
received
so
as
they
continued
with
the
series
perhaps
it
was
a
marketing
decision
to
draw
the
attention
of
fans
of
the
original

As
for
what
The
Legend
is
you
have
to
look
at
the
first
game
in
the
timeline
The
Legend
of
Zelda
Skyward
Sword

In
that
game
this
Zelda
is
not
a
princess
but
the
first
human
mortal
reincarnation
of
the
goddess
Hylia

This
is
further
explained
at
the
back
of
the
Hyrule
Historia
book
in
a
translated
manga
titled
The
Legend
is
Born
a
page
of
which
I
have
taken
a
photo
of

Whenever
the
land
of
Hylia
is
in
danger
we
shall
be
reborn
Long
story
short
Zelda
is
the
reincarnation
of
Hylia
the
goddess
of
the
world
seen
in
the
games

Link
while
important
is
a
creation
of
Hylia
not
a
god
himself

I
think
it
s
fair
to
say
that
at
the
time
of
release
of
the
first
game
the
legend
simply
was
the
story
of
the
game

Tons
of
games
were
called
legend
of
something
at
the
time
and
those
were
always
games
where
the
story
was
the
legend
the
title
referred
to

Zelda
was
no
exception

and
then
it
became
a
loooong
legend

Maybe
the

There
really
is
an
in
universe
Legend
of
Zelda
mentioned
in
the
instruction
manual
of
Zelda
II
as
told
by
Impa
Link
the
time
has
come
when
I
must
tell
you
the
legend
of
Zelda
handed
down
in
Hyrule

It
is
said
that
long
ago
when
Hyrule
was
one
country
a
great
ruler
maintained
the
peace
in
Hyrule
using
the
Triforce

However
the
king
too
was
a
child
of
man
and
he
died

Then
the
prince
of
the
kingdom
should
have
become
king
and
inherited
everything
but
he
could
inherit
the
Triforce
only
in
part

The
prince
searched
everywhere
for
the
missing
parts
but
could
not
find
them

Then
a
magician
close
to
the
king
brought
him
some
unexpected
news

Before
he
died
the
king
had
said
something
about
the
Triforce
to
only
the
younger
sister
of
the
prince
Princess
Zelda

The
prince
immediately
questioned
the
princess
but
she
wouldn
t
tell
him
anything

After
the
prince
the
magician
threatened
to
put
the
princess
into
an
eternal
sleep
if
she
did
not
talk
but
even
still
she
said
nothing

In
his
anger
the
magician
tried
to
cast
a
magic
spell
on
the
princess

The
surprised
prince
tried
to
stop
him
but
the
magician
fought
off
the
prince
and
went
on
chanting
the
spell

Then
when
the
spell
was
finally
cast
Princess
Zelda
fell
on
that
spot
and
entered
a
sleep
from
which
she
might
never
awake

At
the
same
time
the
magician
also
fell
down
and
breathed
his
last

In
his
grief
the
prince
placed
the
princess
in
this
room

He
hoped
that
someday
she
would
come
back
to
life

So
that
this
tragedy
would
never
be
forgotten
he
ordered
that
every
female
child
born
into
the
royal
household
shall
be
given
the
name
Zelda

And
although
Zelda
II
may
be
one
of
the
lesser
popular
entries
of
the
series
today
did
sell
less
than
the
original
it
was
actually
fairly
well
received
in
its
day
and
remained
in
Nintendo
Power
s
Top
Players
Picks
lists
for
a
good
five
years
regularly
placing
in
the
former
even
up
to
December

Thanks
for
your
answer
It
s
actually
interesting
to
see
the
two
versions
of
the
same
story
which
are
both
legitimate
answers

My
only
recommendation
would
be
to
re
word
your
last
paragraph
accusing
other
users
of
being
wrong
whether
true
or
not
often
isn
t
very
well
received

didn

Zelda
wasn

just
that
this

wasn

well

as
the

As
I
recall
Zelda
ended
up
outranking
Zelda
after

You
re
right
and
thanks
for
the
advice

Sorry
if
my
last
paragraph
came
across
as
confrontational

I
reworded
it
to
be
a
bit
more
civil

I
didn
t
mean
to
criticize
Gwellin
s
answer
but
I
admit
I
do
get
irked
when
Zelda
II
is
treated
as
an
outcast
of
sorts
even
by
the
game
s
own
developers
when
looking
back
the
game
was
actually
received
rather
well

I
appreciate
it

I
thought
of
pointing
out
my
wording
and
intentions
but
didn
t
take
offence

Zelda
II
is
a
good
game
that
suffers
from
being
too
different
from
what
everyone
expected
which
tends
to
mean
fewer
people
give
it
a
try

I
know
some
intense
fans
of
Zelda
II
and
have
learnt
to
appreciate
the
game
much
more
from
them

This
was
found
within
the
initial
game
The
Legend
of
Zelda
Many
years
ago
Prince
Darkness
Gannon
stole
one
of
the
Triforce
with
Power

Princess
Zelda
had
one
of
the
Triforce
with
Wisdom

She
divided
it
into
units
to
hide
it
from
Gannon
before
she
was
captured

Go
find
the
units
Link
to
save
her

To
see
this
all
you
had
to
do
was
wait
at
the
title
screen

Simply
do
not
press
the
Start
button
on
the
title
screen

The
music
will
get
a
bit
more
up
beat
and
this
will
scroll
onto
the
screen
for
a
bit

You
could
say
that
the
title
at
the
top
of
this
screen
represented
the
name
of
the
game
but
I
always
thought
of
this
text
as
the
simplified
summarized
version
of
the
legend

The
instruction
manual
for
the
first
game
introduced
a
slightly
longer
backstory
noting
Link
saved
a
woman
named
Impa
who
told
Link
this
information

A
long
long
time
ago
the
World
was
in
an
age
of
Chaos

In
the
middle
of
this
chaos
in
a
little
kingdom
in
the
land
of
Hyrule
a
legend
was
being
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
the
legend
of
the
Triforce
golden
triangles
possessing
mystical
powers

One
day
an
evil
army
attacked
this
peaceful
little
kingdom
and
stole
the
Triforce
of
Power

This
army
was
led
by
Gannon
the
powerful
Prince
of
Darkness
who
sought
to
plunge
the
World
into
fear
and
darkness
under
his
rule

Fearing
his
wicked
rule
Zelda
the
princess
of
this
kingdom
split
up
the
Triforce
of
Wisdom
into
eight
fragments
and
hid
them
throughout
the
realm
to
save
the
last
remaining
Triforce
from
the
clutches
of
the
evil
Ganon

At
the
same
time
she
commanded
her
most
trustworthy
nursemaid
Impa
to
secretly
escape
into
the
land
and
go
find
a
man
with
enough
courage
to
destroy
the
evil
Gannon

Upon
hearing
this
Ganon
grew
angry
imprisoned
the
princess
and
sent
out
a
party
in
search
of
Impa

Braving
forests
and
mountains
Impa
fled
for
her
life
from
her
pursuers

As
she
reached
the
very
limit
of
her
energy
she
found
herself
surrounded
by
Gannon
s
evil
henchmen

Cornered
What
could
she
do
But
wait
All
was
not
lost

A
young
lad
appeared

He
skillfully
drove
off
Ganon
s
henchmen
and
saved
Impa
from
a
fate
worse
than
death

His
name
was
Link

During
his
travels
he
had
come
across
Impa
and
Ganon
s
henchmen

Impa
told
Link
the
whole
story
of
the
princess
Zelda
and
the
evil
Ganon

Burning
with
a
sense
of
justice
Link
resolved
to
save
Zelda
but
Ganon
was
a
powerful
opponent

He
held
the
Triforce
of
Power

And
so
in
order
to
fight
off
Ganon
Link
had
to
bring
the
scattered
eight
fragments
of
the
Triforce
of
Wisdom
together
to
rebuild
the
mystical
Triangle

If
he
couldn
t
do
this
there
would
be
no
chance
Link
could
fight
his
way
into
Death
Mountain
where
Ganon
lived

Can
Link
really
destroy
Ganon
and
save
the
Princess
Zelda
Only
your
skill
can
answer
that
question

Good
luck

Use
the
Triforce
wisely

Tell
Me
A
Story
is
a
monthly
column
in
which
I
examine
the
storytelling
elements
of
specific
video
games

A
little
over
ten
years
ago
when
the
Gamecube
was
in
its
infancy
Nintendo
unveiled
to
the
world
a
tech
demo
for
a
project
titled
The
Legend
of
Zelda


The
demo
featured
a
realistically
styled
battle
between
Link
and
his
eternal
nemesis
Ganon
rendered
artfully
in
real
time

While
the
company
offered
no
official
word
on
the
nature
of
demo
media
speculation
ran
rampant

IGN
went
so
far
as
to
flout
the
demo
as
absolutely
everything
we
could
have
hoped
for
in
a
Gamecube
Zelda
title

A
year
later
the
dark
demo
was
replaced
by
a
cel
shaded
one
with
a
whimsical
cartoon
style
a
radically
different
product
from
demo


When
the
final
product
was
released
it
wasn
t
the
sober
gritty
game
intimated
by
The
Legend
of
Zelda


This
was
the
new
cartoon
version
complete
with
cheery
overtones
and
a
stunningly
bright
color
palette

In
hopes
of
extending
Zelda
s
reach
to
all
ages
in
the
words
of
Shigeru
Miyamoto
the
company
released
The
Legend
of
Zelda
The
Wind
Waker
in
December
of


Nearly
ten
years
have
passed
and
since
then
Zelda
s
black
sheep
has
shaken
off
its
initially
accrued
confusion
in
favor
of
a
seat
deep
in
the
heart
of
franchise
fans

Warning
spoilers
ahead

My
most
recent
playthrough
of
the
game
involved
a
dear
friend
who
grew
up
on
the
series
myself
and
my
hard
to
impress
baby
brother
who
would
rather
teabag
his
friends
in
Call
of
Duty
than
participate
in
some
boring
single
player
story
game

Before
we
even
got
around
to
rescuing
Link
s
sister
there
were
Hearts
dancing
in
his
eyes

Personal
anecdotes
aside
after
a
little
under
a
decade
of
existence
The
Wind
Waker
has
proven
to
be
more
iconic
and
classic
than
originally
thought

The
Legend
of
Zelda
Symphony
of
the
Goddess
arrangements
feature
an
entire
suite
dedicated
to
the
game
s
Celtic
rooted
music

Toon
Link
s
sweet
little
mug
graces
Super
Smash
Bros

What
Zelda
fan
doesn
t
recognize
the
chiming
sound
of
that
infamous
baton
echoing
the
rhythms
of
the
wind
Or
better
yet
the
riff
played
when
Tetra
winks
The
story
is
not
your
typical
Zelda
fare
probably
because
the
game
s
aesthetic
is
one
of
wind
and
water
rather
than
the
elements
at
large

Players
spend
an
amount
of
time
bordering
on
inordinate
but
still
fun
sailing
between
islands
tendrils
of
cartoon
drawn
wind
pushing
at
your
sail

Link
s
trips
across
the
waters
are
frequent
and
mastering
long
range
weapons
for
naval
combat
is
a
necessity

For
the
first
time
since
A
Link
to
the
Past
Link
has
a
family

The
presence
of
Link
s
grandmother
and
little
sister
Aryll
raises
the
stakes

Link
has
a
home
to
come
back
to
a
home
filled
with
people

Unlike
previous
Links
who
have
abandoned
friends
and
bachelor
households
for
the
sake
of
his
quest
this
Link
has
a
base
that
is
both
a
personal
strength
and
liability

While
he
has
his
family
as
a
reason
to
fight
the
good
fight
his
grandmother
and
sister
also
present
a
terrible
liability
for
our
hero
jeopardizing
their
safety
is
an
emotional
weakness
for
Link
who
must
ultimately
save
them

This
becomes
crystal
clear
when
Aryll
is
kidnapped
within
the
first
thirty
minutes
of
the
game

The
legend
passed
down
is
the
story
of
Ocarina
of
Time
a
boy
in
green
defeats
Ganon
and
the
world
becomes
the
Great
Sea

Ganon
s
presence
creeps
back
into
the
world
and
while
none
on
Link
s
homeland
of
Outset
Island
know
what
became
of
the
fabled
Kingdom
of
Hyrule
they
do
know
that
the
boy
in
green
the
Hero
of
Time
did
not
appear
to
save
them
once
more

In
tradition
with
this
legend
the
boys
of
Outset
Island
dress
in
green
when
they
come
of
age

This
method
of
introducing
Link
s
classic
green
tunic
with
a
history
and
purpose
behind
it
echoed
in
the
knighting
ceremony
of
Skyward
Sword
is
a
heart
warming
sign
that
the
player
is
controlling
a
boy
who
is
just
beginning
to
grow
up

This
spins
a
thread
of
the
old
coming
of
age
trope
through
The
Wind
Waker

Link
changes
internally
as
he
leaves
his
mark
on
the
world
around
him
developing
a
sense
of
his
responsibilities
in
this
fantasy
hyperbole
of
maturation

Zelda
s
hold
on
the
game
is
tenuous
at
best
until
her
reveal
much
later
on
but
there
is
still
a
young
lady
in
the
middle
of
the
action

The
mysterious
unattainable
woman
that
has
traditionally
been
Princess
Zelda
is
replaced
by
not
one
but
two
very
real
women
Aryll
and
Tetra

Aryll
s
kidnapping
is
the
impetus
for
Link
to
venture
out
with
Tetra
and
Tetra
s
allure
as
the
tomboyish
charming
pirate
captain
is
hard
to
ignore

Aryll
is
the
delicate
helpless
princess
that
Tetra
will
never
be
Tetra
who
even
after
her
awakening
as
a
descendant
of
Zelda
retains
the
same
air
of
brazen
strength
about
her

These
two
women
girls
really
serve
as
foils
to
each
other

Sweet
Aryll
drives
Link
to
action
and
keeps
him
moving
forward
through
the
power
of
their
sibling
bond

Tetra
challenges
Link
goading
him
further
by
asserting
her
dominance
and
superiority

Her
initial
distrust
of
our
blonde
haired
hero
gives
him
the
motivation
to
persevere
to
prove
his
own
value

Whereas
past
Zeldas
give
Link
their
immediate
trust
and
faith
Tetra
s
must
be
earned

Stealing
bombs
from
her
own
ship
and
seeking
to
rescue
Aryll
himself
spark
her
interest
and
as
she
closely
observes
him
via
the
Pirate
s
Charm
she
begins
to
warm
up
to
the
idea
that
there
is
more
to
Link
than
he
outwardly
demonstrates

The
evolution
of
Tetra
s
trust
in
Link
adds
to
the
coming
of
age
motif
and
a
deeper
element
to
their
relationship

This
is
not
a
princess
in
a
dungeon
pouring
her
hope
into
the
hero
this
is
a
smart
careful
woman
pushing
Link
to
earn
her
favor

Earning
Tetra
s
respect
is
earning
the
blessing
of
the
princess
and
ultimately
her
awakening

Tetra
like
Link
is
still
very
young
but
has
enough
of
a
commanding
presence
to
captain
a
band
of
grown
men

Zeldas
are
normally
sweet
demure
and
the
picture
of
the
untouchable
princess
on
her
pedestal

Tetra
breaks
this
mold
and
in
taking
Zelda
off
her
pedestal
and
placing
her
out
in
the
open
she
becomes
a
character
that
we
can
interact
with
on
a
deeper
level
there
is
no
sugar
coating
she
is
a
real
and
ordinary
woman
for
a
majority
of
the
game

Once
her
ancestry
is
revealed
Link
continues
to
fight
for
and
alongside
her
but
the
more
you
know
the
more
you
care
and
the
player
can
t
help
but
become
deeply
attached
to
Tetra
in
a
way
that
is
radically
different
from
their
attachment
to
Princess
Zelda

The
attachment
is
to
a
real
girl
and
there
are
no
preconceived
notions
about
how
breathtakingly
wonderful
she
is
or
how
sweet
and
how
angelic

This
Zelda
is
not
a
goddess
incarnate
she
is
a
woman
with
flaws
pride
and
a
snarky
temper
most
notably
that
is
more
easily
relatable

The
Wind
Waker
cannot
be
brought
up
without
discussing
the
boat

The
King
of
Red
Lions
is
The
Wind
Waker
s
answer
to
Navi
and
Tatl
and
to
an
extent
Epona

Link
cannot
bring
the
boat
onto
dry
land
therefore
forcing
the
player
to
think
through
puzzles
without
their
trigger
finger
on
the
hint
button

Removing
Link
s
faithful
companion
from
most
of
the
puzzles
he
must
solve
forces
the
player
to
think
a
little
harder

The
Wind
Waker
is
deeply
tied
to
Ocarina
of
Time
both
in
its
legendary
and
historical
tradition
and
in
its
presentation

Knowledge
of
Ocarina
while
not
necessary
to
understand
Wind
Waker
enriches
certain
parts
of
the
game

For
example
the
castle
in
Hyrule
displays
seven
stained
glass
windows
each
bearing
an
image
of
a
sage
from
Ocarina

Both
physically
and
plot
wise
the
story
is
driven
by
wind

Wind
is
what
guides
the
King
of
Red
Lions
over
the
waves
and
often
is
what
you
need
to
solve
certain
puzzles

There
is
a
heavy
Celtic
aesthetic
to
The
Wind
Waker
and
in
Celtic
lore
wind
is
more
closely
synonymous
with
the
element
of
spirit

The
wind
is
the
spirit
of
the
game
the
only
primary
element
capable
of
overcoming
water
use
of
the
Wind
Waker
is
the
only
way
to
navigate
and
conquer
the
seemingly
endless
Great
Sea

The
Wind
Waker
also
carries
a
hefty
amount
of
literary
tradition
on
its
shoulders

Like
Odysseus
of
The
Odyssey
Link
must
battle
his
way
through
storms
from
island
to
island
acquaint
himself
with
strange
new
races
and
take
down
mythical
beasts

Without
directly
referencing
the
story
characters
such
as
the
Master
of
the
Winds
the
Greek
god
Aeolis
are
taken
directly
from
the
epic

Link
s
journey
to
retrieve
the
Triforce
smacks
of
Jason
and
the
Argonauts

As
he
defeats
monsters
forges
alliances
and
awakens
sages
to
his
aid
and
goblins
to
his
wrath
Link
grows
to
become
a
legendary
hero
much
like
Jason

The
Celtic
influence
coupled
with
its
cartoonish
art
style
creates
an
atmosphere
akin
to
that
of
unveiling
an
ancient
story
or
legend

Like
the
legend
the
people
of
Outset
Island
pass
among
themselves
the
player
is
being
passed
the
story
of
this
Link
the
Hero
of
the
Winds
who
could
conduct
air
and
bend
it
to
his
will

The
vivid
color
palette
and
rounded
almost
over
exaggerated
shapes
and
shading
presents
a
moving
storybook
a
gorgeous
foray
into
what
a
child
s
imagination
must
look
like

The
player
is
watching
a
new
story
a
new
history
unfold
and
the
art
style
reflects
the
wide
eyed
sense
of
wonder
we
are
meant
to
experience

As
always
Link
provides
enough
of
a
blank
slate
on
which
to
project
ourselves
and
make
our
own
decisions
in
game
progression
but
to
an
extent
the
production
team
has
wanted
us
to
feel
like
the
start
struck
children
Nintendo
hoped
to
reach
out
to
with
The
Wind
Waker

Nintendo
has
integrated
storytelling
elements
into
the
actual
functionality
of
the
game

A
significant
amount
of
time
is
spent
sailing
between
islands
battling
creatures
that
swim
and
ride
cyclones
along
the
way

This
allows
the
game
to
mask
its
loading
times
by
rendering
the
data
as
the
player
approaches
the
island

Use
of
the
Wind
Waker
changes
the
direction
of
the
wind

In
order
to
discover
or
unlock
certain
islands
Link
must
search
for
map
pieces
including
the
eight
TriForce
charts
that
he
must
decode

If
the
player
is
taking
too
long
to
figure
out
a
course
of
action
be
it
on
a
random
small
island
or
in
the
middle
of
a
dungeon
Link
s
big
expressive
cartoon
eyes
will
often
look
in
the
direction
you
need
to
go

But
perhaps
the
most
tantalizing
element
from
The
Wind
Waker
is
its
particular
incarnation
of
Ganon

Wielding
dual
swords
this
Ganon
towers
high
over
Link
hiding
in
the
Forbidden
Fortress
and
abducting
girls
in
hopes
that
one
of
them
may
be
Zelda

As
he
tells
Link
the
wind
in
his
homeland
always
brought
death
a
sharp
contrast
to
the
guiding
wind
of
the
Great
Sea

Ganon
coveted
this
wind
which
is
the
same
peaceful
wind
that
blew
over
Hyrule

He
sought
the
Triforce
in
order
to
fulfill
his
wish
to
expose
Hyrule
to
the
sun
so
that
he
may
conquer
it

Ganon
seeks
to
conquer
Hyrule
because
he
desires
freedom
from
destruction
he
seeks
to
destroy
so
that
he
may
find
peace

He
may
be
maniacal
and
extreme
in
his
ways
but
Ganon
only
wants
to
tame
a
wind
that
nurtures
rather
than
kills
though
he
will
kill
for
it

Before
the
battle
with
Puppet
Ganon
he
tells
Link
and
Tetra
So
many
pathetic
creatures
scattered
across
a
handful
of
islands
drifting
on
this
sea
like
fallen
leaves
on
a
forgotten
pool



What
can
they
possibly
hope
to
achieve
Don
t
you
see
All
of
you



Your
gods
destroyed
you
Like
the
Great
Flood
of
the
Bible
the
land
and
its
people
were
washed
away
by
the
gods
desire
to
hit
the
reset
button
to
seal
an
evil
entity
for
which
they
were
running
out
of
options
to
combat

Ganon
is
a
realist
he
isn
t
spinning
stories
he
is
telling
it
like
it
is
from
the
viewpoint
of
someone
who
has
been
raised
in
a
life
of
hardship

You
can
t
help
by
sympathize
with
Ganon
or
at
least
feel
a
little
sorry
for
his
predicament

A
man
from
a
far
off
country
which
by
the
look
of
his
clothes
may
be
Asia
has
traveled
the
world
to
attract
the
attention
of
a
new
set
of
gods
and
to
seek
a
more
comforting
wind
or
spirit
if
you
ve
been
keeping
up
with
the
Celtic
undertones

His
final
speech
is
poignant
powerful
and
sad



Actually
I
ll
let
Ganon
tell
you
himself

The
man
s
last
words
are
a
cry
out
to
whatever
gods
are
listening
from
his
homeland
or
Hyrule

As
he
feels
his
own
spirit
leave
his
body
he
sighs
The
wind



it
is
blowing



A
colorful
cast
of
characters
and
an
even
brighter
design
make
The
Legend
of
Zelda
The
Wind
Waker
a
real
treat
for
gamers
for
both
hardcore
and
casual
Zelda
fans

A
break
in
the
traditional
mold
Nintendo
has
set
for
the
series
The
Wind
Waker
is
a
refreshing
breath
of
air
a
treat
of
a
game
with
hidden
depth
beneath
its
main
quest

The
game
builds
on
what
Ocarina
of
Time
and
Majora
s
Mask
have
already
established
but
with
the
added
twist
of
unique
artistic
style
and
a
foundation
built
on
an
ancient
culture
deeply
invested
in
its
legends
and
spirituality

The
game
presents
a
story
that
is
both
fun
and
heart
warming
light
and
dark
proving
that
legends
and
fantastic
tales
are
not
just
for
children
but
those
of
all
ages

So
what
is
a
legend
in
league
what
makes
them
a
legend
Question
Basically
Vi
after
arcane
wasn
t
really
more
powerful
than
an
average
noxian
soldier
but
most
LOL
champs
are
either
hyper
powerful
or
smart

Cait
is
at
least
a
renowned
sniper
Akko
can
go
back
in
time
the
only
questionables

are
Vi
and
silcos
henchman
what
s
her
name
So
what
makes
a
legend
because
the
big
problems
with
arcane
is
a
lot
of
the
character
don
t
really
seem
all
that
legendary
more
just
like
a
glorified
influencer
and
I
hated
the
ending
it
was
rushed

So
in
league
lore
what
makes
a
legend

Why
are
the
legends
needed
and
summoned

Lambertville
High
and
the
Legend
of
Buckeye
Mark
and
Mark
August
The
town
of
Lambertville
was
a
great
place
to
grow
up
especially
in
the
s

All
my
friends
and
I
ran
around
in
leather
and
plaid
harassing
tourists
who
came
to
town
to
go
antique
shopping
and
with
mohawks
held
high
in
the
air
we
would
proudly
march
across
the
bridge
to
New
Hope
and
terrorize
anything
and
everything
that
moved

Since
then
I
have
lived
in
a
number
of
places
and
seen
many
strange
things
currently
I
reside
in
a
correctional
facility
but
of
all
of
the
places
I
have
been
and
all
the
things
that
I
have
seen
my
childhood
times
in
L
ville
were
by
far
the
weirdest

Here
s
a
story
that
I
d
like
to
share
with
the
rest
of
my
fellow
New
Jerseyans
High
atop
a
hill
we
affectionately
call
Music
Mountain
sits
the
ruins
of
the
old
Lambertville
High
School

This
is
where
all
the
kids
from
L
ville
and
the
surrounding
areas
went
to
school
before
South
Hunterdon
was
constructed

I
think
it
closed
down
around
and
burned
down
about


What
s
left
of
the
school
still
stands
today
and
is
even
more
creepy
since
the
fire

On
a
chalkboard
on
the
nd
floor
is
an
intricate
drawing
of
children
sitting
in
rows
of
desks
studying
while
flames
rise
up
on
all
sides
of
them

The
floor
is
a
bit
unstable

Behind
the
school
about
feet
through
some
tall
weeds
and
brush
sits
the
old
football
field
still
marked
clearly
by
the
rusty
old
goal
posts

This
is
where
the
weirdness
begins
the
story
of
Buckeye

It
was
a
cold
day
in
the
middle
of
November


Lambertville
High
was
doing
the
usual
on
this
day
getting
ready
for
the
big
game

You
could
hear
the
marching
band
practice
as
you
walked
in
the
front
door

Banners
hung
in
the
hallways
there
was
a
pep
rally
in
the
gymnasium
and
the
thought
of
L
ville
kicking
the
crap
out
of
its
arch
rival
New
Hope
was
on
the
mind
of
every
kid
at
school
that
day

This
was
one
of
the
biggest
days
of
the
year
at
L
H
S

for
whoever
won
the
annual
Turkey
Bowl
would
have
bragging
rights
for
the
rest
of
the
year

p
m

rolled
around
and
everyone
watched
as
the
New
Hope
buses
rolled
up
the
hill
and
pulled
around
back
to
let
out
the
players
onto
the
field

By
the
game
had
started

Both
teams
went
scoreless
the
first
quarter
but
by
the
time
the
half
rolled
around
the
score
was


You
could
almost
smell
the
tension
in
the
air

The
Eagles
L
ville
and
the
Buckeyes
New
Hope
both
did
their
absolute
best
with
the
half
time
show
hoping
to
get
the
crowd
up
and
the
players
into
the
game

The
third
quarter
now
began

New
Hope
had
the
ball
and
was
running
for
the
touchdown
when
the
wide
receiver
from
New
Hope
was
tackled

To
everyone
s
surprise
he
didn
t
get
up

The
coaches
rushed
the
field
but
by
the
time
they
got
there
the
boy
was
dead
his
neck
broken
and
his
head
almost
turned
completely
around

The
game
was
forfeited

The
parents
of
the
boy
who
was
killed
petitioned
that
football
was
too
dangerous
and
that
New
Hope
should
give
it
up

This
accounts
for
the
reason
why
New
Hope
still
doesn
t
have
a
football
team
to
this
day

The
years
went
on
and
the
memory
of
the
poor
Buckeye
that
lost
his
young
life
that
day
faded
from
everyone
s
memory

L
H
S

packed
its
bags
and
headed
up
to
the
new
school
South
Hunterdon

The
old
high
school
became
the
local
hang
out
for
the
greaser
gangs
of
the
day
and
many
of
the
fights
between
L
ville
and
Flemington
or
New
Hope
took
place
up
there

One
night
a
group
of
or
guys
was
hanging
out
on
the
back
steps
when
one
of
the
guys
told
the
story
about
the
Buckeye
who
had
died
there

He
had
heard
it
from
his
uncle
who
had
gone
to
school
there
at
the
time
it
had
happened

The
guys
were
feeling
a
little
rowdy
and
were
a
bit
drunk

They
started
clowning
around
and
joking
about
the
death
and
one
of
them
stood
up
and
proclaimed
I
challenge
Buckeye
to
a
race
across
the
football
field
Everyone
laughed
and
continued
on
with
their
drinking

Pretty
soon
a
cold
wind
started
to
blow
and
everyone
became
silent

From
the
far
end
of
where
the
football
field
once
was
a
pair
of
evil
red
eyes
appeared
in
the
darkness
and
a
voice
whispered
through
the
wind
and
told
the
boys
Run
across
the
football
field
from
end
to
end
or
die
One
of
the
boys
turned
and
started
to
run
when
he
fell
to
the
concrete
cold
and
blue

The
remaining
boys
heard
the
voice
again
so
they
all
lined
up
on
one
side
of
the
field
and
began
to
run
to
the
other
side

They
ran
with
all
that
they
had
and
when
they
finally
reached
the
other
side
another
one
of
the
boys
was
missing

They
all
ran
home
and
locked
the
doors
behind
them
not
saying
a
word
about
what
had
just
happened

The
next
day
when
the
parents
of
the
two
missing
boys
called
the
police
the
bodies
were
discovered
up
at
the
old
high
school
their
heads
almost
turned
completely
around

The
incident
was
blamed
on
a
fight

Signs
were
posted
and
a
chain
link
fence
was
installed
on
the
driveway
of
the
old
school

I
have
been
to
the
old
high
school
more
times
than
I
can
count
and
can
definitely
vouch
that
there
is
a
strange
presence
there

Every
time
I
walk
up
the
old
concrete
steps
a
chill
goes
down
my
spine

A
few
times
during
my
childhood
I
got
up
the
nerve
to
challenge
Buckeye
but
always
halfway
through
the
word
Buckeye
I
would
get
a
crazy
feeling
and
shut
my
mouth
and
head
right
home

Some
people
claim
it
s
just
a
myth
some
say
it
s
real
but
I
can
say
for
sure
it
is
something

So
if
you
decide
to
visit
the
old
school
take
my
advice
don
t
go
there
alone
and
definitely
don
t
go
there
at
night
Johnny

Challenging
Billy
NOT
Buckeye
to
an
Unfriendly
Game
of
Ball
Buckeye
isn
t
the
name
of
the
dead
football
player
that
most
of
the
local
kids
of
Lambertville
remember
it
is
Billy
that
the
ghost
is
called
I
myself
am
a
resident
of
Lambertville
and
spent
many
a
scary
night
drinking
and
partying
in
the
old
place
believe
me
it
is
not
something
to
fool
around
with
The
local
legend
connected
with
Billy
is
that
if
you
go
to
the
old
stairwell
by
the
front
door
leading
into
the
place
and
than
stand
facing
the
front
window
while
standing
between
the
first
and
second
floor
stairway
and
utter
the
words
I
challenge
Billy
to
a
game
of
football


A
football
will
be
thrown
from
the
top
of
the
staircase
by
Billy
breaking
your
neck
in
two
Just
like
what
happened
to
Billy
almost
years
ago
Another
story
about
the
kids
who
challenge
Billy
to
a
game
of
football
is
that
they
will
be
enveloped
by
a
strange
mist
and
then
will
disappear

A
guy
I
know
named
Lem
actually
did
try
to
summon
Billy
on
the
football
field
once
after
a
kid
they
just
met
brought
them
up
there
to
try
it

The
mist
arose
along
with
a
strong
gust
of
wind
and
he
swears
that
he
saw
something
come
charging
across
the
field
to
get
them

They
all
ran
and
nobody
ever
saw
the
mysterious
kid
again
I
asked
my
grandmother
who
actually
went
to
the
school
and
lives
in
the
middle
of
town
near
Mason
s
Bar

She
assured
me
that
the
legend
of
the
boy
being
killed
during
the
middle
of
the
game
was
true
but
his
name
was
Jimmy
Cavallo
not
Billy
or
Buckeye

American
Revolution
History
Portrait
of
Thomas
Jefferson
by
Rembrandt
Thomas
Jefferson
President
Fun
Facts
About
Thomas
Jefferson
Born
on
April
Thomas
Jefferson
was
a
leading
figure
in
our
country
s
quest
for
independence

A
native
of
Virginia
Jefferson
also
played
important
roles
in
the
early
history
of
our
fledgling
nation
as
its
Minister
to
France
Secretary
of
State
and
third
President

A
true
Renaissance
man
Jefferson
is
known
for
his
many
talents
in
writing
economics
religion
and
philosophy
as
well
as
horticulture
and
mathematics

He
spoke
languages
including
English
French
Greek
Italian
Latin
and
Spanish

He
also
had
a
love
for
the
written
word
having
written
over
letters
in
his
lifetime

A
Multi
Talented
Thinker
Jefferson
was
an
inventor
lawyer
and
educator

He
graduated
from
the
University
of
William
and
Mary
at
the
age
of
two
years
after
he
enrolled
in


He
was
the
designer
of
Monticello
the
Virginia
State
Capital
and
The
Rotunda
at
the
University
of
Virginia
among
other
notable
buildings

His
influential
style
has
become
known
as
Jeffersonian
Architecture


Monticello
and
The
Rotunda
are
both
World
Heritage
Sites

He
Went
on
a
Hunger
Strike
and
Encouraged
Others
to
Join
Him
As
a
member
of
Virginia
s
House
of
Burgesses
Jefferson
called
for
a
day
of
prayer
and
fasting
in
support
of
the
citizens
of
Boston
when
the
British
government
closed
the
harbor
in
response
to
the
Boston
Tea
Party

As
he
had
hoped
this
action
allied
Virginia
with
the
Patriots
cause
in
Massachusetts
and
fueled
opposition
to
the
Intolerable
Acts

He
Was
the
Major
Pen
of
the
Declaration
of
Independence
At
the
age
of
Thomas
Jefferson
was
one
of
the
youngest
delegates
to
the
Second
Continental
Congress
in
Philadelphia

He
became
acquainted
with
John
Adams
a
leader
of
the
Congress
and
through
this
budding
friendship
Jefferson
was
appointed
to
the
Committee
of
Five
that
was
tasked
with
drafting
the
Declaration
of
Independence

Over
the
next
days
he
would
create
the
first
draft

Jefferson
is
considered
by
many
to
be
the
primary
author
of
the
document
because
the
committee
left
intact
more
than
percent
of
his
original
draft

Many
believed
that
John
Adams
would
be
the
primary
author
of
this
important
document
but
he
had
persuaded
the
Committee
to
choose
Jefferson
instead

The
preamble
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
enduring
statements
of
human
rights
and
the
phrase
all
men
are
created
equal
is
considered
one
of
the
most
well
known
expressions
in
the
English
language

Jefferson
was
an
eloquent
writer
but
did
not
fancy
himself
a
public
speaker
and
chose
to
show
his
support
of
the
Patriot
cause
through
written
correspondence

Writing
to
Justify
the
Actions
of
Discontent
Bostonians
In
Jefferson
penned
a
pamphlet
entitled
A
Summary
View
of
the
Rights
of
British
Americans


In
the
pamphlet
he
outlined
a
set
of
grievances
that
the
colonies
had
against
King
George
III

Jefferson
also
wrote
that
an
exasperated
people
who
felt
oppression
when
given
the
chance
would
act
out
in
defiance

The
perfect
example
of
this
defiance
was
the
destruction
of
the
tea
or
what
would
become
known
as
the
Boston
Tea
Party

Like
his
colleagues
George
Washington
and
Benjamin
Franklin
Jefferson
believed
the
act
was
destruction
of
private
property
subject
to
local
laws
but
his
pamphlet
outlined
why
it
was
justified
as
an
act
of
political
protest

His
Proudest
Moments
Jefferson
s
grave
is
inscribed
with
an
epitaph
of
the
three
things
of
which
he
was
the
proudest

They
are
his
authorship
of
the
Declaration
of
Independence
the
Statute
of
Virginia
that
guaranteed
religious
freedom
and
his
founding
of
the
University
of
Virginia
in


There
is
no
mention
of
him
being
President
on
his
gravestone

A
Family
Man
Jefferson
married
Martha
Wayles
Skelton
a
widow
in


He
fathered
six
children
though
only
two
daughters
survived
to
adulthood

Throughout
his
life
Jefferson
had
twelve
grandchildren
several
of
them
having
lived
with
him
at
Monticello

Jefferson
loved
to
play
with
his
grandchildren
teaching
them
how
to
play
chess
and
a
game
called
Goose

Goose
was
one
of
the
first
board
games
in
the
United
States
rather
similar
to
our
modern
version
of
Chutes
and
Ladders

After
his
wife
died
historians
believe
he
began
a
relationship
with
Sally
Hemings
one
of
his
slaves

After
his
death
Jefferson
s
daughter
allowed
Hemings
to
live
as
a
free
woman
in
Charlottesville
until
she
died
in


DNA
tests
in
show
a
familial
gene
common
between
their
descendants

A
Controversial
Start
to
His
Presidency
It
was
only
after
the
chaotic
election
of
between
Jefferson
and
John
Adams
that
Congress
decided
to
ratify
the
th
Amendment
to
the
Constitution

The
debacle
occurred
when
Jefferson
received
the
same
number
of
electoral
votes
as
his
running
mate
Aaron
Burr
and
Burr
refused
to
concede
the
election

The
House
of
Representatives
decided
the
election
after
ballots
on
February


They
chose
Jefferson
as
President
and
Burr
as
Vice
President

Landmark
Acquisition
Early
in
his
presidency
Jefferson
was
able
to
achieve
one
of
the
greatest
acquisitions
of
his
political
career
with
the
Louisiana
Purchase
which
more
than
doubled
the
size
of
the
United
States

The
acre
tract
of
land
is
one
of
the
most
fertile
on
Earth
and
eliminated
the
nation
s
reliance
on
other
countries
for
its
food

Jefferson
did
not
believe
the
Constitution
gave
him
the
power
to
make
the
million
land
acquisition
but
agreed
with
Congress
to
make
the
purchase

He
appointed
Meriwether
Lewis
and
William
Clark
to
lead
an
expedition
known
as
the
Corps
of
Discovery
to
explore
the
newly
acquired
territory

Sacagawea
who
both
men
acknowledged
as
providing
an
indispensable
service
accompanied
them
on
the
journey

Lifelong
Connection
After
meeting
at
the
Second
Continental
Congress
in
Thomas
Jefferson
and
John
Adams
became
lifelong
friends

Their
relationship
deepened
through
years
of
letter
writing
including
letters
written
between
Abigail
Adams
and
Jefferson

They
spent
years
in
France
together
as
Jefferson
and
Adams
served
as
trade
ministers
in
Europe

The
two
remained
close
friends
despite
their
political
differences
that
is
until
Jefferson
beat
Adams
in
the
Election
of
to
become
President
of
the
United
States

They
resumed
their
close
friendship
after
about
years
of
separation

Both
Thomas
Jefferson
and
John
Adams
died
on
July
the
th
anniversary
of
the
Declaration
of
Independence

Legend
holds
that
Adams
last
words
were
Thomas
Jefferson
survives

Unbeknownst
to
Adams
Jefferson
had
died
a
few
hours
earlier

They
were
the
last
surviving
members
of
the
original
group
of
Patriots
that
became
known
as
America
s
Founding
Fathers

Jefferson
and
Adams
also
share
the
distinction
of
being
the
only
Declaration
of
Independence
signatories
who
would
later
serve
as
President

He
Lives
On
In
addition
to
the
Jefferson
Memorial
near
the
Tidal
Basin
in
Washington
D
C

he
is
immortalized
on
the
bill
the
nickel
and
as
one
of
the
figures
of
Mount
Rushmore

The
memorial
in
the
nation
s
capital
featuring
a
foot
tall
statue
of
Jefferson
was
dedicated
in
on
the
th
anniversary
of
his
birth

is
a
Japanese
media
franchise
consisting
of
video
games
animated
series
and

a

and
other
related
media

The
franchise
takes
place
in
a
shared
universe
in
which
humans
co
exist
with
creatures
known
as
Pok
mon
a
large
variety
of
species
endowed
with
special
powers

The
franchise
s
primary
target
audience
is
children
aged
to
but
it
is
known
to
attract
people
of
all
ages

I
The
franchise
originated
as
a
pair
of
role
playing
games
developed
by
Game
Freak
from
an
original
concept
by
its
founder
Satoshi
Tajiri

Released
on
the
Game
Boy
on
February
the
games
became
sleeper
hits
and
were
followed
by
manga
series
a
trading
card
game
and
anime
series
and
films

From
to
Pok
mon
was
exported
to
the
rest
of
the
world
creating
an
unprecedented
global
phenomenon
dubbed
Pok
mania


By
the
craze
had
ended
after
which
Pok
mon
became
a
fixture
in
popular
culture
with
new
products
being
released
to
this
day

In
the
summer
of
the
franchise
spawned
a
second
craze
with
the
release
of
Pok
mon
Go
an
augmented
reality
game
developed
by
Niantic

Pok
mon
has
since
been
estimated
to
be
the
world
s
highest
grossing
media
franchise
and
one
of
the
best
selling
video
game
franchises

Pok
mon
has
an
uncommon
ownership
structure

Unlike
most
IPs
which
are
owned
by
one
company
Pok
mon
is
jointly
owned
by
three
Nintendo
Game
Freak
and
Creatures

Game
Freak
develops
the
core
series
role
playing
games
which
are
published
by
Nintendo
exclusively
for
their
consoles
while
Creatures
manages
the
trading
card
game
and
related
merchandise
occasionally
developing
spin
off
titles

The
three
companies
established
The
Pok
mon
Company
TPC
in
to
manage
the
Pok
mon
property
within
Asia

The
Pok
mon
anime
series
and
films
are
co
owned
by
Shogakukan

Since
The
Pok
mon
Company
International
TPCi
a
subsidiary
of
TPC
has
managed
the
franchise
in
all
regions
outside
of
Asia

Name
The
original
full
name
of
the
franchise
is
Pocket
Monsters
Poketto
Monsut
which
has
been
commonly
abbreviated
to
Pokemon
since
its
launch

When
the
franchise
was
released
internationally
the
short
form
of
the
title
was
used
with
an
acute
accent
over
the
e
to
aid
in
pronunciation

Pok
mon
refers
to
both
the
franchise
itself
and
the
creatures
within
its
fictional
universe

As
a
noun
it
is
identical
in
both
the
singular
and
plural
as
is
every
individual
species
name
it
is
grammatically
correct
to
say
one
Pok
mon
and
many
Pok
mon
as
well
as
one
Pikachu
and
many
Pikachu


General

Main

Gameplay
of
Pok
mon
The
Pok
mon
franchise
is
set
in
a
world
in
which
humans
coexist
with
creatures
known
as
Pok
mon

Pok
mon
Red
and
Blue
contain
Pok
mon
species
with
new
ones
being
added
in
subsequent
games
as
of
January
Pok
mon
species
have
been
introduced

c
Most
Pok
mon
are
inspired
by
real
world
animals
or
mythical
creatures
based
on
real
life
folklore

For
example
Pikachu
are
a
yellow
mouse
like
species
with
lightning
bolt
shaped
tails
that
possess
electrical
abilities

The
player
character
takes
the
role
of
a
Pok
mon
Trainer

The
Trainer
has
three
primary
goals
travel
and
explore
the
Pok
mon
world
discover
and
catch
each
Pok
mon
species
in
order
to
complete
their
Pok
dex
and
train
a
team
of
up
to
six
Pok
mon
at
a
time
and
have
them
engage
in
Pok
mon
battles

Most
Pok
mon
can
be
caught
with
spherical
devices
known
as
Pok
Balls

Once
the
opposing
Pok
mon
is
sufficiently
weakened
the
Trainer
throws
the
Pok
Ball
against
the
Pok
mon
which
is
then
transformed
into
a
form
of
energy
and
transported
into
the
device

Once
the
catch
is
successful
the
Pok
mon
is
tamed
and
is
under
the
Trainer
s
command
from
then
on

If
the
Pok
Ball
is
thrown
again
the
Pok
mon
re
materializes
into
its
original
state

The
Trainer
s
Pok
mon
can
engage
in
battles
against
opposing
Pok
mon
including
those
in
the
wild
or
owned
by
other
Trainers

Because
the
franchise
is
aimed
at
children
these
battles
are
never
presented
as
overtly
violent
and
contain
no
blood
or
gore

II
Pok
mon
never
die
in
battle
they
faint
upon
being
defeated
and
can
then
be
rejuvenated
at
a
Pok
mon
Center

III
When
a
Pok
mon
wins
a
battle
it
gains
experience
points

After
gaining
a
certain
amount
of
them
the
Pok
mon
levels
up
and
its
statistics
rise

As
its
level
increases
the
Pok
mon
learns
new
offensive
and
defensive
moves
to
use
in
battle

Furthermore
many
species
can
undergo
a
form
of
spontaneous
metamorphosis
called
Pok
mon
evolution
and
transform
into
stronger
forms

Most
Pok
mon
will
evolve
at
a
certain
level
while
others
evolve
through
different
means
such
as
exposure
to
a
certain
item
or
trading
with
another
trainer

History
Origins
The
main
idea
behind
Pok
mon
was
conceived
by
Satoshi
Tajiri

Tajiri
was
born
on
August
and
grew
up
in
Machida
a
suburb
of
Tokyo

As
a
child
he
enjoyed
discovering
and
catching
insects
and
other
small
creatures
in
the
various
ponds
and
fields
that
surrounded
his
town

During
Japan
s
economic
miracle
many
cities
including
Machida
were
significantly
expanded

As
a
consequence
Machida
s
nature
was
largely
destroyed

In
his
second
year
of
junior
high
school
an
arcade
hall
opened
in
Tajiri
s
neighborhood
introducing
him
to
video
games

While
studying
electrical
engineering
at
Tokyo
College
of
Technology
ja
Tajiri
began
publishing
a
doujinshi
magazine
titled
Game
Freak

The
title
was
inspired
by
the
film
Freaks
which
Tajiri
was
fascinated
with
at
the
time

He
self
published
the
first
issue
of
the
magazine
in
March
at
the
age
of


At
the
time
magazines
specializing
in
video
games
did
not
yet
exist
in
Japan
allowing
Game
Freak
to
fill
a
gap
in
the
market

Sometime
later
Tajiri
was
contacted
by
aspiring
manga
artist
Ken
Sugimori
who
became
Game
Freak
s
illustrator

Game
Freak
folded
in
the
late
s
by
which
point
Tajiri
had
become
a
respected
game
journalist
in
Japan
s
fledgling
video
game
industry

Tajiri
s
knowledge
of
video
games
brought
him
into
contact
with
Tsunekazu
Ishihara

Ishihara
had
studied
Arts
and
Science
at
Tsukuba
University
and
was
trained
in
CGI

After
working
in
advertising
for
two
years
Ishihara
joined
a
company
named
Sedic
in
which
created
video
graphics
and
software
including
one
video
game
Otocky


As
video
games
grew
in
popularity
Sedic
also
produced
a
number
of
game
related
television
shows
for
Fuji
Television
s
late
night
slot

In
his
job
as
a
TV
producer
Ishihara
befriended
Tajiri
as
well
as
Shigesato
Itoi
who
would
later
become
CEO
of
Ape
Inc

Ishihara
was
also
the
general
director
of
the
world
s
first
gaming
encyclopedia

Terebig

Denshi
Y
gi
Taizen


Kenji
Hatakeyama
Masakazu
Kubo
wrote
that
at
the
time
Ishihara
was
probably
the
most
well
connected
man
in
the
industry
with
a
knowledge
of
games
beyond
comparison


Ishihara
was
also
interested
in
playing
cards
and
contributed
to
the
development
of
at
least
three
simple
card
games
designed
by
Itoi
and
published
by
Ape

d
In
Tajiri
Sugimori
and
a
few
other
enthusiasts
started
an
informal
development
team
called
Game
Freak
named
after
the
magazine
it
grew
out
of

Over
the
next
few
years
they
independently
developed
the
puzzle
game
Quinty
working
on
it
alongside
school
or
their
regular
jobs

However
no
one
within
the
group
knew
how
to
make
the
game
s
music

After
consulting
all
his
contacts
Tajiri
got
in
touch
with
Junichi
Masuda
who
became
the
group
s
composer

Quinty
was
finished
in
and
published
by
Namco

Tajiri
officially
incorporated
Game

Co

Ltd

on
April

Tajiri
started
to
think
of
what
was
to
become
Pok

while
completing
Quinty
and
before
he
officially
founded

Around
this
time
Nintendo
announced
the
upcoming
release
of
the
Game

a
handheld
console
that
would
revolutionize

Game
Boys
could
be
linked
together

Sometime
later
Tajiri
remembered
an
incident
while
playing
Dragon
Quest
II
a
role
playing
game
RPG
for
the
Famicom
NES


The
game
features
randomly
appearing
items
of
varying
rarity
including
an
extremely
rare
item
called
Mysterious
Hat

e
Tajiri
did
not
encounter
any
while
Ken
Sugimori
who
was
also
playing
the
game
encountered
two

Upon
recalling
this
experience
Tajiri
realized
that
the
cable
now
made
it
possible
to
transfer
things
from
one
cartridge
to
another

IV
He
noted
that
until
then
the
Game
Link
Cable
was
only
used
for
competing
but
not
for
something
else

Combining
this
inspiration
with
his
memories
of
catching
insects
and
other
small
species
Tajiri
s
idea
would
eventually
evolve
into
a
virtual
recreation
of
his
boyhood
experiences
and
an
attempt
to
regain
the
world
that
he
had
lost


He
would
later
state
that
the
game
represents
the
story
of
a
boy
s
summer
day

Gashapon
capsules
have
been
cited
as
an
inspiration
for
Pokemon

Tajiri
and
his
Game
Freak
staff
began
pondering
over
a
game
centered
on
capturing
creatures
of
differing
rarity

Since
the
Game
Boy
is
a
portable
device
these
creatures
could
then
be
exchanged
with
other
players
in
real
life
using
the
link
cable

Once
the
player
has
caught
a
creature
in
game
it
was
to
be
stored
in
miniaturized
form
in
a
special
capsule

This
facet
of
the
game
was
inspired
by
Ultraseven
a
tokusatsu
show
that
Tajiri
had
enjoyed
as
a
child

The
series
titular
character
owns
a
number
of
capsules
containing
miniaturized
kaiju
monsters
which
come
out
and
return
to
their
original
sizes
when
the
capsule
is
thrown
into
mid
air

Kaiju
media
in
general
were
an
important
influence
on
Pokemon
as
many
Game
Freak
staff
members
had
grown
up
with
them

Other
influences
that
have
been
cited
by
Tajiri
include
gashapon
capsules
with
toy
figures
in
them
that
can
be
drawn
from
vending
machines
collectible
cards
such
as
baseball
cards
Ultraman
cards
and
menko
V
The
Final
Fantasy
Legend
the
first
RPG
for
the
Game
Boy
and
petting
in
Japan
with
Tajiri
noting
that
having
Pokemon
is
similar
to
having
pets

Tajiri
initially
named
his
project
Capsule
Monsters
which
GF
s
staff
commonly
shortened
to
Capumon

However
it
later
turned
out
that
the
term
Capsule
Monsters
could
not
be
trademarked
and
it
was
subsequently
decided
to
call
the
game
Pocket
Monsters
which
became
Pokemon

According
to
Tomisawa
the
phrase
Capsule
Monsters
was
already
registered

According
to
Hatakeyama
Kubo
the
word
capsule
could
not
be
used
in
the
trademark

Tomisawa
states
that
the
Game
Freak
staff
then
came
up
with
several
alternatives
before
someone
within
the
team
suggested
Pocket
Monsters


In
March
Nintendo
co
founded
Ape
Inc

with
Itoi

Ape
s
principal
work
was
Mother
a
role
playing
game
written
by
Itoi
but
it
was
also
founded
with
the
intent
to
give
outside
talent
a
chance
to
pitch
new
innovative
games

At
the
time
Ape
was
housed
in
the
same
Kanda
Sudach
office
building
as
Nintendo
located
in
Tokyo

Ishihara
a
friend
of
both
Itoi
and
Tajiri
was
involved
with
Ape
s
management
and
would
become
its
vice
president
in


Tajiri
s
relationship
with
Ishihara
prompted
Tajiri
to
present
his
idea
for
Pocket
Monsters
at
Ape
s
office

Present
during
Tajiri
s
pitch
was
Takashi
Kawaguchi
who
worked
at
Nintendo
s
General
Affairs
Department
and
was
also
a
manager
at
Ape

Kawaguchi
brought
the
idea
to
Nintendo
president
Hiroshi
Yamauchi
who
reportedly
said
This
is
it

This
is
the
idea
I
ve
been
waiting
for

By
pure
coincidence
Ishihara
had
come
up
with
an
idea
for
a
game
similar
to
that
of
Tajiri
and
around
the
same
time
was
discussing
it
with
Ape

This
game
Toto
involved
using
the
Game
Boy
as
an
insect
cage


Ishihara
emphasized
however
that
the
idea
of
trading
creatures
with
the
link
cable
was
Tajiri
s

GF
and
Ape
agreed
to
merge
their
projects
together

According
to
Tajiri
the
two
teams
initially
collaborated
on
the
game
but
the
work
proved
difficult
one
of
the
reasons
being
that
Ape
was
busy
developing
EarthBound

Tajiri
eventually
figured
that
rather
than
working
with
Ape
we
had
to
do
something
on
our
own
or
the
project
would
never
get
finished


Ape
Inc

is
not
credited
on
the
final
product

The
development
contract
was
signed
at
the
beginning
of
with
a
planned
delivery
of
the
game
in
October

Tajiri
directed
the
project
working
under
Ishihara

Ishihara
was
the
producer
he
managed
the
budget
staff
and
work
schedule
monitored
the
game
s
overall
progress
and
served
as
a
liaison
between
Game
Freak
and
Nintendo

Ishihara
also
contributed
ideas
to
the
development
and
helped
with
debugging

Sugimori
was
in
charge
of
the
graphics
and
character
design

Masuda
created
all
music
and
sound
effects
and
did
part
of
the
programming

The
budget
that
Nintendo
granted
to
Game
Freak
was
low
thus
Pocket
Monsters
was
initially
planned
as
a
small
compact
game
based
primarily
around
Tajiri
s
core
idea
of
exchanging

However
as
development
progressed
GF
s
ideas
and
ambitions
for
Pokemon
grew

They
soon
realized
that
the
game
they
were
beginning
to
envision
would
not
be
easy
to
make

Sugimori
admitted
that
at
the
time
no
one
at
GF
had
much
knowledge
of
RPGs

We
thought
we
could
handle
it
but
as
we
began
working
we
realized
it
was
going
to
be
tough
he
acknowledged

Pocket
Monsters
was
suspended
indefinitely
and
GF
turned
their
focus
on
other
titles
see
Game
Freak
Games


After
the
game
s
initial
development
phase
in
and
the
staff
tinkered
with
it
from
time
to
time
as
Sugimori
put
it

For
instance
by
October
a
large
number
of
Pokemon
had
been
designed
and
a
poll
was
held
that
month
among
all
staff
members
to
gauge
the
popularity
of
the
different
species

Several
more
such
votes
followed
to
determine
collectively
which
Pokemon
should
be
included

Still
development
had
mostly
come
to
a
halt
until
the
summer
of
after
the
release
of
the
platform
game
Pulseman
upon
which
Tajiri
decided
it
was
time
to
make
a
serious
effort
towards
finishing
Pocket
Monsters

By
this
point
Game
Freak
s
experience
had
grown
considerably

Over
the
years
a
number
of
new
staff
members
had
been
added
to
the
company

One
of
them
was
Atsuko
Nishida
a
graphic
artist
who
created
Pikachu
among
others

Ishihara
used
his
knowledge
of
card
games
to
add
more
depth
to
the
battle
system
and
among
other
things
suggested
Pokemon
types

Ishihara
also
came
up
with
the
idea
of
the
Pokedex
a
portable
encyclopedic
device
which
players
can
use
to
keep
track
of
the
Pokemon
they
caught

Throughout
the
years
Tajiri
had
several
conversations
with
Shigeru
Miyamoto
Nintendo
s
top
game
designer
who
Tajiri
described
as
a
mentor
figure

Although
in
a
retrospect
Miyamoto
downplayed
his
role
in
advising
Tajiri
and
stated
that
his
contributions
to
Pokemon
were
in
fact
limited

Miyamoto
did
however
suggest
the
use
of
different
colored
cartridges
for
the
game
in
response
to
Tajiri
s
and
Ishihara
s
musings
about
making
each
playthrough
slightly
different
as
to
individualize
the
player
s
experience

According
to
Tajiri
five
or
seven
colors
were
considered
but
they
eventually
settled
on
two
Red
and
Green

Otherwise
identical
each
had
Pokemon
not
found
in
the
other
encouraging
players
to
socialize
and
trade
to
complete
their
collection

Ishihara
aspired
to
create
video
games
of
his
own

As
Pocket
Monsters
Red
and
Green
were
nearing
completion
Ishihara
founded
Creatures
Inc

on
November


Upon
founding
the
company
was
housed
in
the
same
office
building
as
Nintendo
in
Tokyo

Co
ownership
of
the
Pokemon
property
which
Ishihara
helped
create
was
subsequently
assigned
to
Creatures

This
resulted
in
Pokemon
having
three
legal
owners
Game
Freak
the
main
developer
Creatures
representing
producer
Ishihara
and
Nintendo
the
publisher

Anne
Allison
wrote
that
Nintendo
also
bought
the
property
after
Red
and
Green
were
finished

Hatakeyama
Kubo
noted
that
the
ownership
structure
of
Pokemon
is
uncommon

They
wrote
that
Pokemon
is
probably
the
only
property
in
the
world
today
for
which
the
original
rights
are
not
concentrated
in
a
single
company
like
The
Walt
Disney
Company
does
with
their
IPs

Tajiri
and
Ishihara
did
consider
merging
Game
Freak
and
Creatures
at
one
point

However
Tajiri
decided
against
it
because
he
feared
it
would
erase
what
he
had
built
up
since
he
was
a
teenager

I
felt
threatened
by
the
idea
of
changing
how
Game
Freak
was
operating
and
starting
back
over
with
Mr

Ishihara
he
said

It
was
an
identity
problem

If
Game
Freak
ceased
to
exist
then
so
would
I


Tajiri
noted
that
since
Game
Freak
and
Creatures
both
focus
on
Pokemon
it
sometimes
felt
more
like
different
departments
than
different
companies

Pocket
Monsters
Red
and
Green
were
finally
finished
in
December


A
release
date
of
December
that
year
was
announced
but
missed

After
sufficient
cartridges
manuals
and
packages
had
been
manufactured
the
pair
of
games
ended
up
being
published
on
February


However
the
property
was
copyrighted
in
and
is
shown
on
the
title
screens
and
cartridges

This
year
is
since
used
on
the
copyright
notice
seen
on
many
Pokemon
products
even
though
no
actual
Pokemon
product
was
released
in


Rise
in
Japan
Release
of
Red
Green
Nintendo
had
no
high
expectations
of
Pocket
Monsters
Red
and
Green
and
media
largely
ignored
the
game
s


By
the
seven
year
old
Game
Boy
console
was
considered
yesterday
s
news
and
near
the
end
of
its
lifecycle

On
the
other
hand
new
Game
Boys
continued
to
be
manufactured
and
sold

The
console
was
widespread
and
due
to
its
age
affordable
to
children

Also
the
Game
Boy
had
experienced
a
small
revival
in
Japan
in
due
to
the
success
of
Mario
s
Picross

Coincidentally
this
game
was
directed
by
Ishihara
and
co
developed
by
Ape

The
popularity
of
Mario
s
Picross
incited
Nintendo
to
develop
the
Game
Boy
Pocket
a
slimmer
and
improved
version
of
the
Game
Boy
released
in
Japan
on
July


Because
of
the
timing
and
naming
some
were
under
the
impression
that
the
Game
Boy
Pocket
was
made
to
promote
Pocket
Monsters
but
this
was
in
fact
a
coincidence
that
would
end
up
benefiting
both

CoroCoro
manga
Mew
lottery
Two
media
channels
that
would
play
important
roles
in
the
Pokemon
franchise
were
the
CoroCoro
Comic
released
monthly
and
its
sister
magazine
Bessatsu
CoroCoro
Comic
released
bi
monthly

Both
manga
magazines
are
published
by
Shogakukan
a
long
time
business
partner
of
Nintendo
and
have
featured
manga
based
on
Nintendo
properties
e
g

Super
Mario
kun
Kirby
of
the
Stars
Donkey
Kong


At
the
time
of
Pokemon
s
release
the
main
CoroCoro
magazine
was
read
by
one
in
four
elementary
school
students

CoroCoro
s
deputy
editor
in
chief
was
Masakazu
Kubo
ja


On
Ishihara
s
suggestion
Kubo
commissioned
the
creation
of
a
manga
adaptation

Written
and
illustrated
by
Kosaku
Anakubo
ja
its
first
chapter
was
featured
in
the
March
April
issue
of
Bessatsu
CoroCoro
Comic
released
on
February
the
day
after
Red
and
Green
s
release

Shogakukan
which
frequently
surveys
their
target
groups
determined
that
the
Pocket
Monsters
manga
was
well
received

To
further
promote
Red
and
Green
the
May
issue
of
CoroCoro
released
on
April
announced
the
Legendary
Pokemon
Offer
centered
around
a
mysterious
secret
Pokemon
called
Mew

Mew
was
a
last
minute
addition
to
Red
Green

It
is
unobtainable
in
the
game
s
through
usual
means
and
was
intended
to
be
used
at
a
later
point
in
some
post
launch
activity

To
participate
in
the
promotion
CoroCoro
readers
had
to
send
in
a
postcard
and
from
the
entrants
were
selected
at
random

The
winners
then
had
to
send
in
their
cartridge
so
that
Mew
could
be
uploaded
onto
it

The
lottery
was
a
success
and
increased
word
of
mouth

By
September
sales
of
Red
and
Green
had
surpassed
million
units

Blue
Version
After
the
release
of
Pokemon
Red
and
Green
Game
Freak
continued
to
grow
and
a
number
of
new
employees
were
hired

For
training
purposes
they
were
ordered
to
study
and
make
bug
fixes
to
the
source
code
of
Red
Green
and
to
create
new
sprites
for
it
the
test
was
later
dubbed
Pocket
Monsters
Blue

It
was
originally
not
meant
to
be
sold

Only
a
small
number
of
handmade
copies
were
made
intended
as
a
special
gift
to
to
people


After
Kubo
learned
of
it
he
encouraged
Tajiri
and
Ishihara
to
allow
an
official
release
of
Blue

President
Hiroshi
Yamauchi
initially
rejected
this
fearing
it
would
confuse
people
into
believing
it
was
an
entirely
new
Pokemon
game

Kawaguchi
then
suggested
an
alternative
which
Yamauchi
agreed
with
Blue
would
not
receive
a
normal
retail
release
but
would
instead
be
made
available
only
through
mail
order
for
a
limited
time
as
a
special
offer

It
was
announced
in
the
November
issue
of
CoroCoro
which
explicitly
stated
that
Blue
was
not
a
new
game
but
rather
a
special
limited
edition
to
celebrate
million
sales
of
Red
and
Green

The
offer
was
a
surprisingly
big
success
units
were
expected
to
be
sold
but
over
double
was
ordered

Trading
Card
Game
The
Pokemon
Trading
Card
Game
was
one
of
the
first
collectible
card
games
CCGs
developed
in
Japan

Its
creation
was
influenced
by
Magic
The
Gathering
the
first
CCG
in
history

Indeed
the
Pokemon
Trading
Card
Game
can
be
considered
a
simplified
version
of
Magic

First
released
in
the
United
States
in
Magic
had
gained
popularity
not
just
in
North
America
and
Europe
but
also
in
Asia

Ishihara
was
fond
of
playing
cards
and
had
contributed
to
the
development
of
at
least
three
simple
card
games
designed
by
Shigesato
Itoi
and
released
through
Ape
Inc

d
At
the
time
Ishihara
was
particularly
interested
in
Magic
The
Gathering

While
developing
the
Pokemon
RPG
he
realized
that
the
concept
behind
it
could
be
adapted
into
a
Magic
like
CCG

The
Pokemon
Trading
Card
Game
was
designed
by
Ishihara
Akihiko
Miura
K
ichi
yama
and
Takumi
Akabane

All
were
former
staff
members
of
Ape
and
had
previously
worked
on
EarthBound
Miura
was
the
game
s
main
designer
yama
was
its
art
director
and
Akabane
was
one
of
its
chief
debuggers

While
card
games
have
a
long
history
in
Japan
a
collectible
card
game
was
a
relatively
new
concept
there
and
at
the
time
not
widely
known

Because
of
this
Ishihara
had
difficulties
finding
distributors

Sometime
in
Ishihara
pitched
the
card
game
to
Nintendo

They
agreed
to
have
the
cards
manufactured
subcontracting
an
unidentified
printing
company

However
Nintendo
did
not
want
the
hassle
of
having
to
develop
a
distribution
system
from
the
ground
up
i
e

finding
retailers
willing
to
sell
a
CCG

Ishihara
was
then
contacted
by
Satoshi
Kayama
director
of
a
small
firm
called
Media
Factory

Like
Ishihara
Kayama
was
a
fan
of
card
games

He
felt
that
CCGs
would
soon
rise
to
prominence
in
Japan
and
had
been
gathering
information
on
the
possibility
of
developing
such
a
game
in
some
form

When
Kayama
heard
that
Creatures
had
developed
a
CCG
he
contacted
Ishihara
and
offered
to
distribute
it
signing
the
contract
near
the
end
of


CoroCoro
again
proved
a
valuable
information
channel

The
Trading
Card
Game
was
first
announced
in
the
November
issue
the
same
one
that
announced
Pokemon
Blue

The
issue
came
bundled
with
two
promo
cards
one
of
Purin
Jigglypuff
and
one
of
Pikachu

Surveys
showed
that
they
were
respectively
the
most
and
second
most
popular
Pokemon
at
the
time

On
October
the
first
card
set
was
released

Booster
packs
were
launched
the
same
day
containing
randomly
inserted
cards

In
the
West
the
booster
packs
contained
cards

f
The
original
set
would
be
titled
the
Base
Set
in
English

Many
more
sets
would
follow

Despite
being
ignored
by
the
media
except
for
the
CoroCoro
the
cards
became
an
instant
success
upon
release

million
Pokemon
cards
were
shipped
by
the
end
of
March
six
months
after
its
launch
and
one
month
before
the
debut
of
the
next
big
installment
of
the
franchise
the
Pokemon
anime

The
success
of
the
TV
series

cards
sales
figure
to
explode
by
March
a
total
of
million
cards
had
been
produced
in
Japan

Anime
production
launches
By
August
Kubo
had
become
convinced
of
Pokemon
s
potential
and
believed
Shogakukan
should
create
an
anime
adaptation

Nintendo
was
hesitant
noting
that
if
the
anime
would
flop
it
would
negatively
affect
the
popularity
of
the
game

Ishihara
initially
opposed
the
idea
because
he
thought
it
would
overly
hasten
the
consumption
of
the
property
he
feared
that
if
the
series
would
end
people
would
assume
that
Pokemon
has
ended
and
move
on
to
the
next
thing

At
the
time
Creatures
and
Game
Freak
were
planning
the
sequel
s
to
Red
and
Green
Pokemon
Gold
and
Silver
and
Ishihara
did
not
want
the
anime
to
end
before
they
could
release
their
new
games

Kubo
was
ultimately
able
to
resolve
the
concerns
of
all
parties
involved

An
important
aspect
of
Kubo
s
bargaining
power
was
the
then
ongoing
Mini
WD
craze
and
its
accompanying
hit
series
Bakus
Ky
dai
Let
s
Go


Kubo
had
an
important
role
in
the
creation
of
both
which
impressed
the
stakeholders

To
appease
Ishihara
Kubo
promised
him
that
the
anime
would
last
for
at
least
a
year
and
a
half

This
was
unusually
long
for
a
debuting
anime
and
required
a
big
investment

Kubo
s
proposal
for
Pocket
Monsters
was
officially
approved
on
September


For
Nintendo
of
Japan
it
was
the
first
time
they
licensed
a
TV
series

Kubo
assigned
independent
producer
Choji
Yoshikawa
ja
to
lead
the
project

Shogakukan
Productions
commonly
called
ShoPro
was
Shogakukan
s
production
company

The
animation
company
they
commissioned
was
OLM
Inc

Oriental
Light
and
Magic
on
Kubo
s
suggestion

Kunihiko
Yuyama
one
of
OLM
s
founding
members
became
the
anime
s
director

ShoPro
assembled
a
team
of
five
writers
plus
two
supporting
writers

All
key
people
involved
with
the
production
of
Pokemon
were
well
experienced
and
had
proven
track
records
within
Japan
s
anime
industry

Yoshikawa
felt
that
the
team
got
lucky

The
probability
of
so
many
great
people
coming
together
at
the
same
time
is
very
low
he
said

Per
Tajiri
s
explicit
condition
every
anime
team
member
had
to
play
the
game
extensively
including
the
illustrators
and
voice
actors

The
anime
staff
unanimously
agreed
that
the
game
was
interesting
and
felt
connected
with
each
other
through
the
world
of
Pokemon
feeling
positively
challenged
to
make
an
anime
that
would
match
the
game
s
quality

A

Pikachu
became
a
popular
character
among
both
boys
and
girls

A
production
council
was
formed
to
produce
the
anime

Different
people
appeared
at
different
meetings
but
four
individuals
usually
present
were
Ishihara
of
Creatures
Sugimori
of
Game
Freak
Yuyama
of
OLM
and
independent
producer
Yoshikawa

Yoshikawa
had
the
final
say

The
council
decided
on
the
anime
s
worldview
characters
general
storyline
and
various
important
details

The
early
meetings
which
were
also
attended
by
Tajiri
usually
started
with
a
Q
A
session
in
which
Tajiri
and
Ishihara
were
asked
about
the
Pokemon
universe

The
council
was
careful
to
have
the
anime
be
in
concordance
with
the
video
game

Inevitably
there
had
to
be
differences
between
the
two
but
all
agreed
that
the
overall
worldview
as
envisioned
by
Tajiri
should
not
be
disturbed

At
the
start
of
the
video
game
the
player
has
to
choose
one
of
three
starter
Pokemon
Fushigidane
Hitokage
or
Zenigame
Bulbasaur
Charmander
or
Squirtle


The
council
didn
t
want
to
unfairly
popularize
any
of
them
and
wanted
the
protagonist
to
start
out
with
a
different
Pokemon

Hatakeyama
Kubo
wrote
that
by
coincidence
three
people
independently
suggested
to
the
council
that
a
Pikachu
should
be
a
main
character
in
the
anime
Kubo
Yuyama
and
Keisuke
Iwata
of
TV
Tokyo
s
Film
Department

In
the
end
all
council
members
agreed
that
Pikachu
should
be
one
of
Pocket
Monsters
central
icons
as
they
expected
Pikachu
to
appeal
to
both
boys
and
girls
as
well
as
their
mothers

This
would
expand
its
audience
which
was
considered
a
core
objective
of
the
anime

During
the
council
s
first
meeting
Yoshikawa
brought
up
the
issue
on
whether
the
Pokemon
in
the
anime
could
talk
and
if
not
how
they
could
communicate

In
the
video
games
each
has
a
specific
cry

In
Anakubo
s
CoroCoro
manga
most
could
speak

At
first
the
council
believed
there
should
be
a
mixture
of
Pokemon
that
could
talk
and
some
that
could
not

However
this
idea
was
eventually
discarded
the
Pokemon
had
to
make
a
specific
cry

The
council
agreed
that
Pokemon
were
like
animals
and
while
they
and
humans
should
be
able
to
understand
each
other
in
the
series
they
should
not
speak
each
other
s
language

It
was
decided
that
Pikachu
would
repeatedly
say
its
own
name
in
various
intonations

The
role
of
Pikachu
was
given
to
Ikue
Otani

During
try
outs
Yuyama
had
Otani
voice
Pikachu
in
normal
Japanese
as
well
as
in
Pikachu
talk
in
which
it
only
said
the
syllables
of
its
name

Yuyama
realized
that
even
in
the
latter
style
of
limited
communication
Otani
was
experienced
enough
to
still
convey
the
messages
and
emotions
needed

ShoPro
paid
half
of
the
production
cost
of
Pokemon

TV
Tokyo
paid
the
other
half
and
was
granted
co
ownership
of
the
anime

The
ads
during
the
show
s
commercial
breaks
were
managed
by
advertisement
agency
JR
Kikaku
ja
which
was
in
turn
paid
by
sponsors
buying
advertisement
space

In
negotiating
with
TV
Tokyo
Kubo
managed
to
secure
the
timeslot
on
Tuesdays

Pocket
Monsters
premiered
on
April


By
November
it
had
become
the
highest
rated
program
on
TV
Tokyo

The
anime
succeeded
in
its
goal
of
widening
Pokemon
s
audience

Although
the
video
games
and
the
cards
remained
mostly
of
interest
to
boys
the
anime
also
got
more
girls
interested
in
the
franchise
and
girls
purchases
of
Pokemon
products
increased

This
has
been
partly
credited
to
Pikachu
who
gained
widespread
popularity
among
both
boys
and
girls

The
success
of
this
character
would
later
lead
to
the
game
Pocket
Monsters
Pikachu
Pok
mon
Yellow
Special
Pikachu
Edition
released
in
Japan
on
September


An
adaptation
of
Pokemon
Blue
this
version
was
made
to
resemble
the
TV
series
more

Copyright
council
formed
merchandising
expands
In
the
early
months
of
the
franchise
Nintendo
was
the
contractual
representative
for
Pokemon
and
thus
the
central
contact
point
for
all
Pokemon
related
licensing
the
approval
of
branded
products


Around
the
time
that
planning
of
the
anime
begun
licensing
requests
for
Pokemon
started
to
increase
which
Nintendo
had
difficulties
handling
due
to
a
lack
of
experienced
staff

Nintendo
consequently
granted
ShoPro
exclusive
licensor
rights

This
was
the
first
time
that
Nintendo
of
Japan
NoJ
granted
licensor
rights
to
another
company
aside
from
its
overseas
subsidiaries
Nintendo
of
America
NoA
and
Nintendo
of
Europe
NoE


A
copyright
council
was
formed
headed
by
Ishihara

Beginning
in
April
the
council
met
every
Tuesday
in
the
conference
room
of
Creatures
office
at
the
Nintendo
Kanda
Building
in
Sudach
Tokyo

Attendees
usually
included
Ishihara
and
his
secretary
representatives
of
Nintendo
Game
Freak
ShoPro
TV
Tokyo
and
JR
Kikaku
as
well
as
head
of
the
anime
Yoshikawa

Broadly
put
every
meeting
had
three
types
of
agenda
items
discussing
Pokemon
related
events
and
basic
policies
in
Japan
discussing
Shogakukan
publication
plans
and
considering
merchandise
proposals

For
merchandising
the
council
set
the
bar
high

Fiercely
protective
of
Pokemon
s
brand
equity
Ishihara
was
unwilling
to
greenlit
an
item
just
because
it
had
a
picture
of
a
Pokemon
printed
on
it

To
avoid
the
market
being
flooded
with
low
quality
goods
Ishihara
put
very
specific
demands
on
the
products
he
evaluated

Furthermore
in
most
cases
the
council
opted
to
contract
one
company
for
each
product
category

Because
of
this
most
merchandise
proposals
were
rejected
of
the
approximately
applications
submitted
in
only
about
was
approved

By
March
companies
offered
licensed
Pokemon
goods
and
there
were
approximately
Pokemon
products

Tomy
manufactured
Pokemon
toy
figures
and
plush
dolls

Bandai
made
Pokemon
gashapon
dolls
and
ramune
flavored
candy
in
a
plastic
box
in
the
shape
of
a
Game
Boy

Meiji
Seika
produced
Pokemon
chocolate
snacks
and
pudding

The
lucrative
franchise
provided
a
much
needed
boost
to
Japan
s
economy
which
was
stagnating
in
what
would
later
be
called
the
Lost
Decade

An
example
of
a
firm
that
benefited
greatly
from
Pokemon
was
food
manufacturer
Nagatanien
jp


From
May
the
company
began
selling
Pokemon
branded
curry
furikake
and
baking
mixes

In
December
Nagatanien
was
hit
hard
by
the
collapse
of
one
of
its
biggest
sales
channels
Toshoku
in
what
was
then
the
third
largest
bankruptcy
in
Japan
s
postwar
history

Nonetheless
due
to
their
Pokemon
licensed
products
Nagatanien
reported
net
profits
in
fiscal
years
and
despite
having
forecasted
losses

Denn
Senshi
Porygon
incident
See

Pok
mon
episodes
removed
from
rotation
In
the
evening
of
December
the
Pokemon
franchise
was
hit
by
a
crisis
related
to
the
broadcast
of
the
anime
s
th
episode
Denn
Senshi
Porygon
Computer
Warrior
Porygon


It
was
watched
by
approximately


million
households

In
the
episode
the
cast
is
transported
into
a
virtual
world
accompanied
by
a
Porygon
a
digital
human
made
Pokemon

While
flying
through
cyberspace
they
are
attacked
by
an
anti
virus
program
which
mistakes
them
for
viruses
shooting
vaccine
missiles
at
the
group
resulting
in
explosions
of
bright
rapidly
swapping
red
and
blue
flashes

The
intense
stimuli
brought
about
by
the
episode
triggered
a
variety
of
adverse
health
effects
in
more
than
viewers
primarily
irritated
eyes
headaches
dizziness
and
nausea

A
small
part
suffered
a
photosensitive
epileptic
seizure
manifested
in
loss
of
conscious
and
or
convulsions

Hundreds
g
of
children
were
brought
to
hospitals
although
a
part
of
them
had
recovered
enough
upon
arrival
and
did
not
need
to
be
hospitalized

No
one
died

Broadcasting
of
Pokemon
was
halted
and
new
guidelines
were
implemented
to
help
prevent
similar
events
from
happening

With
the
show
on
hiatus
ShoPro
and
OLM
worked
on
a
feature
Pokemon
film

By
the
time
the
incident
occurred
its
script
was
already
written
and
the
movie
was
in
the
storyboard
stage

In
mid
January
the
staff
resumed
creating
new
episodes

The
anime
series
returned
on
April


The
film
titled
Pocket
Monsters
the
Movie
Mewtwo
Strikes
Back
Pok
mon
The
First
Movie
premiered
on
July
and
became
the
fourth
highest
grossing
film
of
the
year
in
Japan

Ultimately
the
incident
did
not
damage
the
Pokemon
franchise
it
in
fact
grew
further
during
and
after
the
anime
s
hiatus

While
video
rental
tapes
were
removed
from
shelves
all
other
Pokemon
products
continued
to
be
sold
as
usual
and
customer
demand
for
them
remained
high

Helping
matters
was
a
general
understanding
among
businesses
that
the
anime
was
not
canceled
but
rather
suspended
and
many
executives
correctly
expected
the
show
to
be
resumed
after
precautions
had
been
taken

Supermarkets
and
other
distribution
outlets
responded
calmly
to
the
crisis
and
did
not
remove
Pokemon
products
from
their
sales
floors

International
expansion
North
America
When
we
started
this
project
in
Japan
one
of
the
first
things
I
was
told
was
that
this
kind
of
thing
would
never
appeal
to
American
audiences

They
said
Because
the
characters
are
in
a
very
Japanese
style
you
cannot
sell
them
to
Americans


So
from
the
very
beginning
I
never
thought
there
would
be
an
English
version

Now
it
s
just
as
popular
in
the
United
States
as
in
Japan
and
I
realized
that
we
shouldn
t
always
believe
the
opinions
of
conservative
marketers

Shigeru
Miyamoto
August
Possibly
the
first
person
to
show
interest
in
a
North
American
launch
of
Pokemon
was
Minoru
Arakawa
founder
and
then
president
of
Nintendo
of
America
NoA


Arakawa
visited
Japan
to
participate
in
Shoshinkai
held
November


It
was
around
this
time
when
he
first
played
one
of
the
three
Pokemon
titles

He
thought
the
games
were
promising
but
Nintendo
of
Japan
NoJ
had
no
plans
at
the
time
to
release
them
elsewhere

He
returned
to
America
with
a
few
cartridges
and
tested
the
game
on
his
employees
they
did
not
believe
it
would
work
in
the
US

At
the
time
role
playing
games
RPGs
were
not
very
popular
outside
Japan
and
NoA
executives
believed
that
American
children
did
not
have
the
attention
span
for
such
a
complex
title

Americans
were
said
to
be
more
interested
in
sport
and
action
oriented
games
preferably
with
realistic
graphics

Japanese
people
by
contrast
were
alleged
to
care
more
about
characters
and
plot

Up
to
that
point
few
Japanese
properties
had
been
successfully
mainstreamed
in
the
US
and
if
they
were
it
was
alleged
to
be
on
account
of
having
been
properly
Americanized
Mighty
Morphin
Power
Rangers
was
considered
a
prime
example
of
this

Visually
Pokemon
was
believed
to
be
too
kawaii
or
cute

It
was
assumed
that
Pokemon
could
not
succeed
on
cute
alone
it
must
also
be
cool

In
an
effort
to
enhance
the
franchise
s
coolness
NoA
considered
a
graphical
redesign
and
contracted
a
few
external
artists
to
create
some
test
designs
for
the
American
market

The
mockups
they
proposed
included
graffiti
style
drawings
beefed
up
and
more
muscular
looking
Pokemon
and
a
new
Pikachu
that
looked
like
a
tiger
with
huge
breasts


Arakawa
concluded
that
it
didn
t
work
and
by
that
time
the
anime
had
begun
its
production
in
Japan
leading
NoA
to
conclude
it
was
too
late
for
a
graphical
revamp
anyway

Of
pivotal
importance
to
Pokemon
s
global
expansion
was
Alfred
R

Kahn
CEO
of
US
based
Kids
Entertainment
NoA
s
licensing
agent
since


Convinced
of
the
franchise
s
potential
Kahn
agreed
to
invest
an
undisclosed
sum
in
return
for
both
the
anime
and
licensing
rights

Pokemon
became
one
of
the
first
Japanese
media
franchises
in
which
both
the
localization
of
the
anime
and
the
licensing
of
merchandise
was
handled
by
a
single
company
as
well
as
a
non
Japanese
company

Kahn
suggested
to
use
the
short
version
of
the
name
Pok
mon
adding
an
acute
accent
over
the
e
to
assist
with
pronunciation
and
give
it
a
little
flair


NoJ
president
Hiroshi
Yamauchi
officially
approved
the
project
in
late
November
and
subsequently
announced
it
at
Space
World


However
three
weeks
later
the
Denn
Senshi
Porygon
incident
happened
which
Kubo
felt
made
even
more
people
resistant
to
the
idea
of
an
overseas
introduction

Market
research
turned
back
negative
American
kids
reportedly
did
not
like
Pok
mon

Arakawa
ignored
the
study
and
convinced
of
the
franchise
s
potential
allocated
an
enormous
budget
to
Pok
mon
s
launch

The
exact
amount
was
not
disclosed
but
was
reportedly
equal
to
or
more
than
million
c



million
in
approximately
the
same
amount
as
the
launch
budget
of
the
Nintendo
Entertainment
System
in


Arakawa
admitted
that
it
was
quite
a
bit
of
money
but
NoA
had
been
doing
well
for
several
years
so
we
had
a
lot
of
money
to
spare


He
opined
that
if
Pok
mon
would
be
as
successful
in
the
US
as
it
had
been
in
Japan
an
investment
of
would
turn
into


NoA
and
Kids
proceeded
to
devise
a
strategy
on
how
to
localize
Pok
mon
for
the
United
States

Arakawa
appointed
Gail
Tilden
to
lead
the
project
prompting
her
to
leave
her
position
at
Nintendo
Power
magazine

Tilden
said
that
they
decided
to
make
an
all
out
effort
to
repeat
the
phenomenon
in
the
Western
world


In
two
press
releases
NoA
self
described
Pok
mon
s
marketing
campaign
as
aggressive


The
localization
of
the
Pok
mon
anime
was
done
by
Kids
and
directed
by
Norman
J

Grossfeld

Grossfeld
strongly
believed
that
the
anime
should
be
Americanized

At
NATPE
he
asked
ShoPro
for
a
kind
of
carte
blanche
to
let
me
change
the
show
as
I
think
would
work
for
this
market
to
which
ShoPro
agreed

However
no
national
TV
station
was
interested
in
buying
the
anime
or
financing
its
localization

Kahn
then
decided
to
self
finance
Pok
mon
s
production
costs
despite
realizing
this
could
very
well
bring
down
Kids
if
the
show
would
fail

According
to
Kahn
they
spend
a
fortune
on
the
localization

To
have
it
broadcast
in
syndication
Kids
offered
the
show
for
free
to
local
TV
stations
across
the
country
in
exchange
for
a
portion
of
the
advertising
revenue

NoA
assisted
persuading
dozens
of
stations
to
carry
the
series
by
offering
to
buy
some
of
their
advertisement
space
spending
a
total
of
million
c



million
in


Despite
all
this
most
broadcasters
were
still
reluctant
to
carry
Pok
mon
with
Grossfeld
experiencing
difficulties
getting
through
their
preconceived
notions
or
their
snobbery
for
Western
produced
animation
over
something
from
Asia


At
the
time
anime
had
not
yet
found
mainstream
popularity
in
the
West

Contemporary
news
reports
cited
Sailor
Moon
VI
as
an
example
of
an
anime
that
had
failed
to
catch
on
with
American
youth

h
Still
with
NoA
s
help
Kids
ultimately
succeeded
in
contracting
broadcasters
for
Pok
mon
reaching
about
to
percent
of
television
households

However
many
broadcasters
gave
it
off
peak
time
slots
with
starting
times
like
or


Prior
to
the
late
s
this
was
the
case
for
many
anime
in
the
US

Grossfeld
came
up
with
the
advertising
slogan
Gotta
catch
em
all
as
the
English
equivalent
to
the
Japanese
Pokemon
GETTO
daze
Get
the
Pok
mon


The
phrase
miraculously
managed
to
gain
approval
by
the
Federal
Communications
Commission
FCC
which
normally
prohibits
the
use
of
injunctions
in
ads
directed
at
children
e
g

You
must
buy
this


While
the
tagline
does
sound
commanding
the
FCC
reasoned
that
the
act
of
catching
is
at
the
core
of
Pok
mon
s
play

Therefore
the
phrase
was
allowed

The
series
theme
song
was
written
by
John
Loeffler
and
John
Siegler
and
performed
by
Jason
Paige

In
commissioning
the
track
Grossfeld
specifically
requested
the
song
s
chorus
to
be
written
around
the
Gotta
catch
em
all
phrase
firmly
embedding
the
slogan
into
the
theme

While
NoA
and
Kids
were
allowed
a
fair
degree
of
liberty
in
their
localization
of
Pok
mon
the
Japanese
copyright
council
headed
by
Ishihara
had
the
last
say
over
it

All
decisions
regarding
adjustments
and
promotion
had
to
gain
final
approval
of
the
Japan
side

This
included
all
of
the
merchandise
for
which
a
two
step
system
was
created

All
aspiring
licensees
in
North
America
were
to
send
their
merchandise
proposals
to
Kids

Staff
of
both
Kids
and
NoA
then
made
a
pre
selection
and
send
the
approved
proposals
to
Japan
where
the
council
made
the
final
decision

Many
submissions
were
bounced
at
the
US
stage
and
thus
never
got
sent
to
Japan

Tilden
noted
that
processing
all
license
applications
and
mailing
all
approved
prototypes
and
their
documentation
to
Japan
was
a
lot
of
work

Arakawa
did
consider
streamlining
the
process
by
moving
someone
from
Japan
to
the
US
but
no
person
could
be
found
who
was
as
competent
as
Ishihara

The
Pok

anime
was
first
broadcast
on
September


Pok

Red
Version
and
Blue

were
released
three
weeks
later
on
September


To
localize
the

game
Nintendo
contracted
Wizards
of
the

the
creator
of
Magic
The

The
Pok

Trading
Card
Game
was
officially
launched
nationwide
on
January
although
pre
sold
in
select
stores
in
December

Coinciding
with
the
North
American
launch
of
Pok

was
the
release
of
the
Game

on
November


Other
regions
The
American
version
of
the
Pok

started
broadcasting
in
Australia
and
New

on

Outside
North

Kids
distributed
the
anime
in
cooperation
with
Brian
Lacey
of
Lacey
Entertainment

The
series
was
presented
at
MIP
TV
in
Cannes
France
from
April


Broadcasters
were
initially
not
interested
due
to
its
Japanese
origins
and
preferred
to
wait
and
see
how
the
anime
would
fare
in
the
US

After
its
American
success
Lacey
received
inquiries
about
the
series
throughout
from
multiple
international
broadcasters

Lacey
noted
that
in
Europe
this
was
a
stark
contrast
compared
to
previous
years
I
was
trying
to
sell
this
sort
of
stuff
for
years
and
buyers
would
tell
me
they
were
moving
away
from
Japanese
animation
shows
he
said

In
October
the
franchise
was
launched
in
the
European
key
markets
of
Germany
the
United
Kingdom
France
and
Spain

The
anime
started
broadcasting
in
Denmark
Norway
and
Sweden
in
December


In
broadcasting
rights
for
the
first
season
were
secured
by
TV
stations
in
South
Africa
Russia
Iceland
and
Finland

In
Israel
the
anime
debuted
in
February


For
unclear
reasons
Red
and
Blue
were
not
officially
released
there

Thriving
only
on
the
strength
of
the
TV
series
The
First

the
cards
and
imported

the
Israeli
Pok

still
became
a
success

By
the
end
of
Pok

games
had
been
released
in
countries
the

Pok
mania
In
North
America
the
debuting
Pok
mon
franchise
quickly
rose
to
success

Red
and
Blue
sold
copies
in
its
first
month

By
December
the
Pok
mon
anime
had
become
the
highest
rated
syndicated
children
s
show
during
the
weekdays

This
attracted
the
attention
of
two
media
companies
Warner
Bros

co
owner
of
The
WB
channel
and
Saban
Entertainment
Fox
Family
Worldwide
owners
of
the
Fox
Kids
channel

A
bidding
war
ensued
between
the
parties
which
was
won
by
Warner
Bros

On
February
Pok
mon
launched
on
the
Kids
WB
national
television
block

The
debut
episode
became
the
most
watched
premiere
in
Kids
WB
s
history

In
European
countries
the
anime
received
similar
levels
of
success

For
example
in
Germany
a
highly
competitive
kids
market
Pok
mon
was
purchased
by
RTL


The
show
s
popularity
bolstered
the
entire
program
block
more
than
tripling
its
viewers

Andrea
Lang
RTL
s
editor
of
cartoons
and
children
s
programs
said
We
were
speechless

We
ve
never
had
a
comparable
success


By
March
half
a
year
before
Pok
mon
s
overseas
launch
million
Pok
mon
cards
had
been
produced

By
March
the
total
number
of
cards
shipped
reached
million

By
March
this
figure
would
grow
further
to


billion
cards
manufactured
in
both
Japanese
and
American
factories

By
April
there
was
a
general
consensus
in
the
US
that
Pok
mon
had
become
a
phenomenon
and
the
newest
children
s
fad

VII
By
some
the
fad
was
referred
to
as
Pok
mania
VIII
including
journalists
of
Time
and
USA
Today

In
the
US
severe
scarcity
occurred
of
Pok
mon
goods
especially
Pok
mon
cards
causing
companies
to
miss
profits

A
Milwaukee
Journal
Sentinel
article
published
on
August
cited
a
Toys
R
Us
manager
as
saying
that
a
supply
of
booster
packs
would
last
hours

The
CEO
of
one
card
distributor
stated
that
they
were
thousands
of
boxes
behind
on
orders

In
the
same
article
a
Wizards
spokeswoman
stated
that
more
employees
and
printers
had
been
hired
to
increase
card
production

However
near
the
end
of
the
month
a
different
Wizards
spokeswoman
told
The
Washington
Post
that
they
had
exhausted
most
of
the
card
printing
capacity
of
the
United
States


Similarly
USA
Today
reported
in
November
that
factories
making
Hasbro
s
Pok
mon
toys
had
expanded
production
by
times
but
demand
still
exceeded
supply

In
Europe
scarcity
of
Pok
mon
merchandise
also
occurred

In
part
due
to
the
Pok
mon
craze
Nintendo
saw
a
increase
in
profits
in
compared
to
the
previous
year
reaching
a
six
year
high

The
Pok
mon
franchise
accounted
for
over
of
Nintendo
s
revenue
that
year

Pok
mon
s
popularity
also
caused
a
sharp
increase
in
sales
of
the
Game
Boy
line

The
financial
windfalls
came
at
a
time
when
Nintendo
lost
dominance
in
the
home
console
market
with
the
Nintendo
being
outsold
by
Sony
s
PlayStation

The
global
success
of
Pok
mon
compensated
this
loss
somewhat

IX
Buckingham
Sefton
Green
went
even
further
writing
in
while
Nintendo
is
now
among
Japan
s
most
profitable
corporations
it
could
be
argued
that
the
company
would
have
struggled
to
survive
without
Pok
mon


Kids
initially
a
little
known
firm
expanded
thirty
times
in
revenues
and
was
named
the
fastest
growing
company
in
America
in
the
September
issue
of
Fortune
magazine

Many
businesses
that
timely
obtained
a
Pok
mon
license
reaped
considerable
profits

In
the
summer
of
a
massive
run
on
stocks
of
publicly
traded
Pok
mon
licensees
caused
their
value
to
increase
dramatically

However
by
November
most
investors
were
shorting
their
shares

Realizing
that
Pok
mon
was
a
fad
that
would
peak
and
fall
at
some
point
investors
were
bearish
about
its
prospects

Pok

The
First
Movie
premiered
in
North
America
on
November
and
in
Europe
the
following
year

Despite
being
negatively
received
by
many
Western
critics
it
became
one
of
the
most
successful
Japanese
animated
films
of
all
time

In
the
United
States
November
was
estimated
to
have
been
the
peak
of
Pok
mania

Supporting

a

action
with
Burger

of
the
largest

The
success
of

really
a

advantage
to

slogan


By
the
relationship
between

USA
PUSA
and
Wizards
of

had
deteriorated

That

All

In

PUSA
told
Wizards
that
their
contract
would
not
be
renewed
and
that
Wizards
would
not
be
distributing
the
new
Ruby

card
set

Later
Wizards
was
also
prohibited
from

Jamboree
and

Notably
Jamboree
was
the
first
set
containing
cards
designed
by
Wizards
themselves

As
considerable
time
and
money
was
invested
into
creating
them
Wizards
was
upset
when
they
were
barred
from
putting
them
out

On
October
the
day
after
their
agreement
expired
Wizards
filed
suit
against

alleging
that
the
defendant
had
seized
their
intellectual
property
and
trade
secrets
and
illegally
tried
to
gain
advantage
over

in
the
competitive

was
settled

Jamboree

Kids

signed
a
new
contract
with

was
announced
that
the

would
expire

moving
all

The
localization
of
the

would
be
done

PUSA
proceeded
to
replace
almost
all

decision
raised
the

as
opposed
to
previously
only
able
to
do
so
locally
and
with
fewer
Pok
mon

The
games
characters
are
D
and
the
environments
are
rendered
in
D
and
it
is
considerably
difficult
to
differentiate
them
because
Game
Freak
designed
them
this
way
to
innovate
the
graphics
while
also
retaining
the
traditional
game
style
and
feel

In
Platinum
the
developers
focused
on
changing
the
most
essential
elements
from
Diamond
and
Pearl
to
maintain
continuity
with
the
previous
games

Director
Junichi
Masuda
stated
that
since
they
designed
Diamond
and
Pearl
as
the
ultimate
Pok
mon
titles
it
was
only
necessary
to
make
Platinum
even
stronger
than
them

They
approached
this
by
designing
the
Origin
Forme
for
the
legendary
Pok
mon
Giratina
ensuring
that
the
design
would
appear
significantly
different
from
its
regular
form
in
Diamond
and
Pearl
and
to
express
the
games
core
antimatter
and
Distortion
World
concepts

The
title
Platinum
was
chosen
to
reflect
a
precious
material
that
shines
and
is
different
from
diamond
and
pearl
and
their
associations
of
love
and
happiness
respectively

Pok
mon
HeartGold
and
SoulSilver
were
released
on
September
in
Japan
and
on
March
in
North
America
as
part
of
Generation
IV

They
are
remakes
of
Gold
and
Silver
aiming
to
balance
familiarity
for
the
original
games
players
and
new
content
for
newcomers

The
titles
reflected
the
theme
of
the
bond
between
trainers
and
their
Pok
mon

The
developers
faithfully
recreated
the
original
story
and
added
elements
from
the
Generation
IV
games
and
Yellow
the
latter
of
which
was
released
concurrently
with
Gold
and

In

merged
to
form
The
Pok

Company
International
TPCi


This
subsidiary
of
The
Pok
mon
Company
TPC
has
since
managed
the
Pok
mon
franchise
outside
of
Asia

In
Generation
V
Pok
mon
Black
and
White
were
released
on
September
in
Japan
for
the
DS
and
on
March
in
North
America

The
games
feature
enhanced
visual
effects
and
increased
use
of
D
graphics

The
developers
excluded
old
Pok
mon
and
strategies
while
introducing
over
new
Pok
mon
to
evoke
a
sense
of
novelty
and
to
provide
new
players
a
more
leveled
playing
field
against
old
players

The
games
seek
to
attract
both
new
players
and
returning
players
through
its
detailed
walkthrough
and
the
addition
of
C
Gear
a
real
time
communication
tool
to
improve
the
trade
and
battle
experiences
respectively

The
games
were
followed
by
Pok
mon
Black
and
White
which
were
released
on
June
in
Japan
and
on
October
in
North
America

The
games
were
developed
for
the
DS
rather
than
the
more
powerful
Nintendo
DS
to
maintain
continuity
with
the
game
world
in
Black
and
White
and
they
were
presented
from
a
different
perspective
in
the
storyline

Since
the
games
are
their
first
sequels
director
Masuda
explained
that
they
have
strived
to
find
a
fine
balance
to
appeal
to
both
newcomers
and
returning
players
by
implementing
introductory
explanations
and
by
placing
a
Pok
mon
Center
in
the
first
in
game
city
they
were
able
to
further
this
approach
by
providing
newcomers
with
a
detailed
walkthrough
and
also
returning
players
with
new
updates

During
development
phase
director
Takao
Unno
revealed
that
they
had
experimented
with
a
player
multiplayer
experience
via
their
communication
feature
Entralink
drawing
from
their
vision
of
players
sharing
the
same
space
same
time
and
same
game
but
this
feature
was
never
implemented
due
to
technical
limitations

D
Generation

VII
Pok
mon
Go
In
Generation
VI
Pok
mon
X
and
Y
were
released
worldwide
for
the
DS
on
October
and
they
are
the
first
games
to
be
released
in
this
way

The
developers
focused
on
the
themes
of
beauty
bond
and
evolution
and
it
is
based
on
these
themes
that
they
created
the
games
core
mechanic
where
Pok
mon
could
achieve
a
higher
form
of
evolution
by
strengthening
their
bonds
with
trainers
however
to
maintain
game
balance
they
limited
this
feature
to
a
special
temporary
phenomenon

The
games
shift
to
fully
D
graphics
allowed
the
player
to
freely
manipulate
the
camera
angles
although
due
to
technical
limitations
objects
far
away
are
rendered
in
lower
polygon
models
and
producer
Hitoshi
Yamagami
addressed
to
D
players
that
Game
Freak
developers
are
also
big
fans
of
D
graphics



So
there
are
some
elements
in
there
that
I
Yamagami
think
fans
of
D
will
appreciate
as
well

When
asked
about
the
Horde
battle
and
Sky
battle
types
he
stated
that
Horde
battles
are
to
supplant
the
roles
of
really
strong
pokemon
sic
to
help
the
player
more
easily
progress
through
the
games
and
also
to
add
more
excitement
to
the
battles
and
a
sense
of
danger
and
that
they
added
the
Sky
battles
to
take
advantage
of
the
games
D
camera
angels
capabilities

Pok
mon
Omega
Ruby
and
Alpha
Sapphire
were
released
worldwide
for
the
DS
on
November
and
on
November
in
Europe
as
part
of
Generation
VI

They
are
remakes
of
Ruby
and
Sapphire

The
developers
adopted
X
and
Y
s
core
game
mechanic
and
added
enhanced
D
graphics

According
to
director
Masuda
they
reviewed
the
original
mechanic
and
concept
and
expressed
them
using
modern
hardware
such
as
replacing
the
original
Pok
Gear
feature
for
the
enhanced
versions
BuzzNav
and
DexNav
to
more
effectively
provide
information
enabled
by
the
games
hardware
capabilities

They
seek
to
explore
the
concept
of
Pok
mon
coexisting
with
humans
and
nature
revisiting
the
concept
behind
original
games
setting
which
translated
to
richness
or
abundance
in
nature
and
bonds
between
people
and
nature
in
Japanese

To
appeal
to
the
newer
audience
in
X
and
Y
the
developers
decided
to
connect
the
story
with
X
and
Y
by
further
exploring
their
core
mechanic

In
Generation
VII
Pok
mon
Sun
and
Moon
were
released
worldwide
for
the
DS
on
November
and
on
November
in
Europe

The
developers
chose
Hawaii
for
inspiration
due
to
its
distinctive
warm
sunlight
and
clear
moonlight
and
unique
biomes
that
helped
support
the
games
regional
Pok
mon
variance
concept

Ohmori
said
as
director
he
aimed
to
focus
on
the
concept
of
Pok
mon
as
these
living
creatures
and
really
focus
on
them
being
alive

Having
the
release
date
on
the
th
anniversary
of
Pok
mon
in
mind
he
treated
this
project
as
a
celebration
of
that
life
and
to
really
express
this
respect
for
life

As
he
contemplated
about
life
and
its
origins
Ohmori
considered
the
significance
of
the
Sun
enabling
life
with
its
light
and
the
Moon
s
impact
on
certain
species
reproduction

He
explained
how
the
Sun
the
Moon
and
the
Earth
work
together
to
influence
one
another
and
life
as
a
result
grows
and
flourishes
based
on
this
relationship

Ohmori
stated
that
with
the
innovation
to
D
in
X
and
Y
the
designers
decided
to
examine
more
minor
aspects
concerning
with
the
Pok
mon
themselves
such
as
their
motions
such
as
when
they
designed
the
games
first
starter
Pok
mon
to
capitalize
on
its
owl
like
characteristics
with
its
head
twists
round
and
round

With
the
DS
technologies
the
developers
are
able
to
design
the
characters
to
be
more
expressive
as
themselves
including
different
facial
expressions
and
reactions

In
addition
to
portraying
Pok
mon
harmoniously
coexisting
with
people
and
vice
versa
in
the
games
the
developers
replaced
the
traditional
Gym
mechanic
with
Island
Trials
deepening
the
players
connection
with
the
story
and
their
Pok
mon

The
enhanced
versions
Pok
mon
Ultra
Sun
and
Ultra
Moon
were
released
worldwide
on
November


The
games
added
an
alternate
storyline
and
additional
characters
Pok

and
other
features

Developer
Shigeki
Morimoto
revealed
that
they
were
developed
by
the
younger
staff
members
and
veterans
so
the
more
veterans
can
prioritized
on
developing
more
important
titles
and
the
developers
considered
them
to
be
their
culmination

a
second

fad
with
the
release
of
Pok

game

The

originated
as
a

The
prank
was
conceived
by
Tsunekazu

and
Satoru
Iwata

On
Ishihara
s
initiation
the
hoax
was
turned
into
an
actual
video
game
developed
by
Niantic

Ishihara
was
a
fan
of
Niantic
s
previous
transreality
game
Ingress
and
saw
the
game
s
concept
as
a
perfect
match
for

Through

the

generated
more
than

with

the

a

of
players
particularly
Pok

players
to
the

feature

Generation

debuted
with
the
release
of
Pok
mon
Sword
and
Shield
on
November
for
the
Switch

Director
Shigeru
Ohmori
stated
that
they
designed
the
games
based
on
what
they
believed
of
the
biggest
Pok
mon
theme
of
becoming
being
the
greatest
or
strongest
which
was
expressed
in
the
games
Dynamax
Gigantamax
Pok
mon
core
mechanic
and
the
games
increasingly
powerful
software
and
hardware
capabilities

Ohmori
further
revealed
that
through
developing
the
Let
s
Go
games
as
research
projects
for
the
Switch
they
were
able
to
gain
valuable
experiences
and
knowledge
to
develop
Sword
and
Shield

He
noted
that
they
took
advantage
of
the
Switch
s
high
resolution
and
TV
connectivity
to
implement
the
games
gigantic
size
core
Pok
mon
mechanic

They
envisioned
the
games
setting
to
be
a
wide
open
space
that
is
different
from
the
traditional
route
systems
and
is
constantly
changing
where
the
player
can
meet
and
explore
with
other
players

Many
pre
existing
Pok
mon
are
not
available
in
Sword
and
Shield

This
Dexit
as
it
was
called
led
to
fan
backlash

Sword
and
Shield
were
the
first
Pok
mon
games
to
receive
DLC
expansions
Part
The

Armor
and
Part

they
were
released
on
June
and
October
respectively

They
include
additional

Pok

characters
and
other
features

In
the
COVID
pandemic
broke
out

The
resulting
widespread
ennui
and
excessive
leisure
time
inspired
a
resurgence
in
popularity
and
interest
of
Pok
mon
cards
which
was
further
popularized
by
various
YouTubers
and
other
influencers
such
as
Logan
Paul

The
craze
resulted
in
severe
supply
shortages
and
customers
inappropriate
and
obsessive
behavior
raised
safety
concerns
in
many
retail
outlets

Pok
mon
cards
values
skyrocketed
prompting
collectors
to
submit
cards
and
overwhelm
card
grading
agencies

The
Pok

Company
responded
by
reprinting
impacted
products
at
maximum
capacity
to
ensure
price
stabilization
and
general
accessibility

Brilliant

They
are
the

games
to
be
developed
by
a
third

developer
ILCA
rather
than

The

revealed
that
the

would
not
assume
the

style
of
the
Let

and
feature
traditional

mechanics

Pok

intends
to
celebrate
their
th
anniversary
with
the
release
of
the
remakes
by
revisiting
old
games
and
mechanics
which
they
faithfully
reproduced
with
enhanced
D
graphics

Pok
mon
Legends
Arceus
was
released
on
January
for
the
Switch
as
a
prequel
to
Diamond
and
Pearl

It
is
part
of
Generation
VIII

The
game
represents
a
new
approach
for
the
Pok
mon
video
game
series
as
it
transitions
from
traditional
RPG
mechanics
to
add
real
time
elements
in
their
games

Unlike
traditional
Pok
mon
games
the
player
can
catch
Pok
mon
by
throwing
a
Pok
Ball
in
real
time
rather
than
triggering
a
battle
however
they
can
still
choose
the
latter
to
weaken
it
for
capture

Many
in

aspects

its

heavily
resemble
those
of

and
it
also

In
and
Pok
mon
was
an
unprecedented
ubiquitous
fad
in
the
Western
world

Time
magazine
described
it
as
a
multimedia
and
interactive
barrage
like
no
other
before
it


The
franchise
primarily
aimed
at
children
elicited
mixed
responses
from
parents
and
teachers
some
of
them
critical

Yano
even
claimed
that
the
reactions
at
one
point
constituted
a
moral
panic

The
bulk
of
the
criticism
on
Pok
mon
was
directed
at
the
trading
cards
in
particular
the
booster
packs
sealed
packages
of
f
randomly
inserted
cards
that
were
sold
separately
from
the
main
sets

The
cards
are
of
varying
scarcity
the
most
valuable
being
the
holofoil
cards
also
called
holographic
or
foil
cards
in
which
the
illustrations
of
the
Pok
mon
have
a
shiny
overlay
effect

The
rare
cards
can
only
be
found
in
booster
packs
and
the
rarest
ones
are
very
infrequently
included

Tobin
notes
that
rarity
in
this
case
is
artificially
created
and
effectively
a
form
of
gambling
in
which
children
need
to
repeatedly
purchase
booster
packs
to
get
more
rare
cards

Broug
re
described
a
cynicism
among
adults
that
corporations
could
apparently
out
of
thin
air
ascribe
value
to
cards
which
they
saw
as
valueless
thereby
deceiving
vulnerable
young
consumers
and
garnering
excessive
profits


As
the
franchise
s
popularity
grew
children
began
taking
their
Pok
mon
cards
to
school
for
trading
and
playing

Soon
the
cards
were
alleged
to
be
disrupting
learning
poisoning
playground
friendships
and
causing
such
distraction
that
some
children
forget
their
homework
tune
out
in
class
and
even
miss
school
buses
as
they
scramble
to
acquire
one
more
card


The
cards
were
turning
the
playground
into
a
black
market
with
card
swaps
sometimes
inciting
conflicts

Certain
children
engaged
in
aggressive
trading
tricking
other
often
younger
kids
into
unfair
deals
forcing
teachers
to
arbitrate

XI
Some
parents
expressed
their
concerns
about
the
craze
but
feared
that
their
children
would
be
ostracized
if
they
were
to
deny
them
Pok
mon
products

In
the
US
the
Pok
mon
cards
ended
up
almost
universally
banned
from
school
grounds

Similar
bans
occurred
in
Canada
Australia
New
Zealand
and
European
countries

In
September
US
based
law
firm
Milberg
filed
a
class
action
lawsuit
against
Nintendo
of
America
Wizards
of
the
Coast
and
Kids

The
suit
claimed
that
the
booster
packs
constitute
a
form
of
lottery
and
promote
gambling
in
kids

Susan
Estrich
noted
that
similar
lawsuits
had
been
filed
against
trading
card
makers
in
the
US
without
success

The
Pok
mon
card
suit
is
not
known
to
have
gone
to
court
and
is
believed
to
have
been
settled

j
The
Pok
mon
anime
series
was
criticized
by
some
as
cheap
Japanese
animation
that
is
violent
and
has
little
educational
value


Michelle
Orecklin
of
Time
dismissed
the
TV
series
as
less
a
cartoon
than
a
half
hour
exercise
in
Pok
mon
product
placement


Allison
wrote
that
even
those
within
Pok
mon
s
US
marketing
team
agreed
that
the
anime
s
visuals
were
not
especially
sophisticated
compared
to
Disney
cartoons

Pok
mon
The
First
Movie
premiered
in
the
United
States
on
November
and
in
European
countries
in
February


While
a
huge
box
office
success
the
film
was
received
negatively
by
several
Western
film
critics

The
Guardian
decried
it
as
a
contemptuously
cheap
animated
cash
in
on
the
monster
kids
craze


The
American
adult
animated
series
South
Park
satirized
Pok
mon
in
the
episode
Chinpokomon
aired
on
November


In
the
episode
the
titular
media
franchise
is
portrayed
as
a
low
quality
line
of
products
that
is
part
of
an
evil
plan
by
the
Japanese
government
to
invade
the
US

South
Park
co
creator
Matt
Stone
commented
that
at
the
time
Pok
mon
was
scary
huge


Kohler
wrote
that
Pok
mon
was
considered
ruthlessly
commercial
and
that
it
program
med
children
to
be
consumers
of
anything
and
everything
Pok
mon


CNN
quoted
child
psychiatrist
John
Lochridge
as
worrying
that
Pok
mon
s
creators
and
marketers
deliberately
set
out
to
create
a
fantasy
world
so
compelling
that
children
would
quickly
become
obsessed


He
believed
that
kids
were
being
brainwashed
and
said
I
have
had
parents
tell
me
that
they
cannot
get
their
kids
to
do
anything
except
Pok
mon
so
this
stuff
seems
to
really
capture
their
minds
in
a
way


These
concerns
were
countered
by
psychologist
William
Damon
who
told
Newsweek
that
obsessing
is
in
fact
a
normal
part
of
a
child
s
neurological
development

It
should
concern
parents
only
when
the
obsession
gets
dangerous
or
excessive

An
op
ed
in
the
New
Zealander
newspaper
The
Dominion
Post
claimed
that
the
anti
Pok
mon
sentiment
was
particularly
American
The
backlash
which
seems
largely
confined
to
the
United
States
may
be
no
more
than
the
sound
of
the
world
s
leading
cultural
imperialist
gagging
on
a
taste
of
its
own
medicine


As
Pok
mania
built
Western
media
started
reporting
on
several
crimes
associated
with
Pok
mon

These
included
violence
including
two
reported
stabbings
burglaries
robberies
some
at
knifepoint
and
shoplifting

Almost
all
these
incidents
were
connected
to
the
Pok
mon
cards
and
the
individuals
involved
were
almost
always
underage

In
the
US
the
incidents
peaked
in
November


In
England
Pok
mon
related
delinquency
reached
a
head
in
April


High
prices
on
the
grey
market
were
a
motive
behind
some
of
the
crimes
posing
a
great
temptation
for
older
kids
and
bullies
to
take
advantage
of
weaker
children


At
specialty
shops
and
online
auctions
a
rare
Pok
mon
card
could
be
bought
and
sold
for
or
more
c

in


Aside
from
the
negative
reactions
many
media
also
cited
alleged
beneficial
effects
of
Pok
mon

It
was
noted
that
the
video
games
and
the
cards
require
children
to
read
memorize
calculate
and
plan
out
a
strategy

Both
encourage
socialization
and
trading
Pok
mon
requires
negotiating
skills

Stephanie
Strom
wrote
in
The
New
York
Times
that
the
Pok
mon
anime
taught
children
traditional
Japanese
values
responsibility
empathy
cooperation
obedience
respect
for
elders
humility


Anne
Allison
interviewed
various
American
parents
during
Pok
mania

She
found
that
while
most
of
them
were
utterly
mystified
about
Pok
mon
few
were
overly
worried
about
it
instead
meeting
the
craze
with
befuddled
acceptance


Allison
also
notes
that
the
Columbine
High
School
massacre
occurred
during
Pok
mania
on
April
causing
violent
television
music
and
games
to
be
scrutinized

Compared
to
these
media
she
notes
Pok
mon
is
in
fact
rather
tame

In
contrast
Pok
mon
received
far
less
criticism
in
its
native
country
of
Japan

Yano
attributes
this
to
cultural
differences
which
includes
greater
acceptance
of
exuberant
consumerism
to
buy
is
to
be
a
good
citizen
less
focus
on
media
influence
instead
Japan
s
educational
system
bullying
and
dysfunctional
families
are
more
often
the
target
of
attention
less
separation
between
child
and
adulthood
what
is
suitable
for
adults
is
not
necessarily
considered
unsuitable
for
kids
Pok
mon
being
permeated
with
kawaisa
cuteness
a
hallmark
of
Japanese
culture
Japan
s
core
religions
Buddhism
and
Shinto
are
less
moralizing
in
nature

However
Oliver
Burkeman
wrote
in
The
Guardian
that
the
Pok
mon
cards
were
also
banned
from
some
Japanese
schools

After
World
War
II
Japan
experienced
a
period
of
unprecedented
growth
and
became
well
known
in
the
Western
world
for
its
consumer
products
such
as
radios
e
g

Panasonic
Toshiba
cars
e
g

Toyota
Mitsubishi
and
Sony
s
Walkman

From
onwards
its
economy
stagnated
causing
the
country
to
lose
its
status
as
an
economic
superpower

However
during
the
s
and
s
Japan
re
emerged
as
a
source
of
cool
cultural
goods
embraced
by
a
growing
international
audience
interested
in
Japanese
culture

XII
Nintendo
Sega
and
Sony
launched
several
popular
video
game
consoles
and
franchises

In
terms
of
children
s
properties
the
success
of
Mighty
Morphin
Power
Rangers
changed
perceptions
on
the
viability
of
such
Japanese
imports
in
the
West

The
Tamagotchi
fad
centered
around
a
portable
digital
pet
device
was
said
to
have
paved
the
way
for
Pok
mon


Anne
Allison
wrote
that
before
the
s
Japan
figured
little
in
the
face
of
the
worldwide
hegemony
of
Euro
American
cultural
industries
in
particular
that
of
the
US

Hollywood
has
been
hostile
to
imports
she
wrote
and
foreignness
has
largely
been
and
been
seen
as
an
impediment
to
mass
popularization
in
the
United
States


The
surprise
success
of
Pok
mon
was
an
undeniable
breakthrough
in
the
homeland
of
Disney
that
changed
preexisting
assumptions
about
the
US
marketplace
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
constantly
resisted
for
deviating
from
them


Pok
mon
was
a
welcomed
boon
to
Japan
s
faltering
economy
and
positively
influenced
the
country
s
soft
power

Kamo
interviewed
various
American
children
and
found
that
kids
who
thought
Pok
mon
was
cool
were
more
likely
to
believe
that
Japan
was
a
cool
nation

Allison
gave
a
similar
finding
all
the
children
she
interviewed
knew
where
Pok
mon
originated
and
many
said
that
as
a
result
of
Pok
mon
and
other
cool
Japanese
goods
they
had
developed
an
interest
in
Japan

A
number
said
that
they
now
wanted
to
study
Japanese
and
travel
there
one
day


Kohler
wrote
Japanese
are
proud
of
Pok
mon
the
most
successful
export
of
Japanese
popular
culture
ever


Although
Iwabuchi
questioned
to
what
extent
Pok
mon
really
is
Japanese
and
to
what
extent
it
is
simply
a
good
property
with
universal
appeal

He
noted
that
Japanese
nationalist
commentators
celebrated
Pok
mon
s
global
success
and
retrospectively
attributed
this
to
its
Japanese
cultural
power
while
ignoring
the
localization
of
Pok
mon
overseas
as
well
as
decades
of
increasing
cooperation
and
cultural
exchange
between
countries
globalization


In
the
th
century
anime
found
niche
popularity
in
North
America
and
Europe
in
series
Astro

the
White

Speed

and
films

The
Pok
mon
TV
series
and
films
marked
a
breakthrough
for
anime
contributing
to
its
growing
worldwide
success
at
the
turn
of
the
st
century

XIV
For
some
children
Pok
mon
was
their
introduction
to
Japanimation
serving
as
a
gateway
to
other
anime
manga
and
Japanese
culture
in
general

Pok
mon
The
First
Movie
became
one
of
the
most
successful
Japanese
animated
films
in
history

After
Princess
Mononoke
Pok
mon
The
First
Movie
became
the
second
anime
film
to
open
at
mainstream
cinemas
in
the
West
as
opposed
to
the
usual
art
house
venues

Pioneering
anime
importer
John
Ledford
noted
that
Pok
mon
underscored
the
commercial
potential
of
anime
thus
making
it
interesting
from
a
business
perspective

In
the
field
of
video
games
the
main
Pok
mon
series
became
the
standard
within
the
monster
taming
game
genre
a
subtype
of
RPGs

While
not
the
first
to
use
this
concept
the
Pok
mon
games
became
so
synonymous
with
it
that
later
titles
involving
catching
and
training
monsters
of
any
genre
were
inevitably
compared
to
Pok
mon

Examples
of
this
include
Dragon
Warrior
Monsters
XV
Robopon
Sun
and
Star
Spectrobes
XVI
Invizimals
XVII
Monster
Crown
XVIII
and
Palworld


XIX
The
success
of
Pok
mon
encouraged
companies
to
look
for
other
popular
Japanese
properties
that
might
be
localized
for
Western
markets

The
importing
of
at
least
three
similar
franchises
were
confirmed
by
business
executives
to
have
been
partly
inspired
by
Pok
mon
Yu
Gi
Oh
Digimon
and
Monster
Rancher

The
import
of
Cardcaptor
Sakura
as
Cardcaptors
might
also
have
been
prompted
by
Pok
mon

From

onwards
the

Since

A

could
not
be
established

The
Fire
and
Disaster

Agency
announced
that
as
of
December
a
total
of
people
had
been
taken
to
hospitals
in
direct
relationship
to
the
Pokemon
episode

Of
these
people
were
actually
hospitalized

However
different
figures
have
been
stated
by
different
sources

According
to
Hatakeyama
Kubo
approximately
children
were
taken
to
hospitals
of
which
were
hospitalized

It
has
been
reported
that
due
to
the
incident
catching
the
country
off
guard
different
methods
of
surveying
were
used
throughout
Japan
and
these
methods
were
not
always
accurate



However
Sailor
Moon
did
gain
a
cult
following
at
the
time

After
being
pulled
from
syndication
in
spring
due
to
low
ratings
it
was
broadcast
again
on
USA
Network
from
June
to
March


The
anime
subsequently
had
a
successful
run
on
Cartoon
Network
s
Toonami
block
from
June
to
July
a
timeframe
that
overlapped
Pok
mania



Shogakukan
kept
this
condition
until


As
of
update
the
last
animated

released
in

Woodward
right
and
Bernstein
left
became
the
embodiment
of
the
media
myth
about
Watergate
By
Prof
W
Joseph
Campbell
American
University
Washington
DC
The
run
up
to
the
th
anniversary
of
the
Watergate
break
in
the
burglary
that
gave
rise
to
America
s
gravest
political
crisis
has
inevitably
been
accompanied
by
the
mythology
that
has
shaped
and
distorted
popular
understanding
of
the
epic
scandal

The
mythology
is
both
delicious
and
durable
and
revolves
around
the
Washington
Post
and
its
Watergate
reporters
Bob
Woodward
and
Carl
Bernstein

They
are
legends
in
American
journalism
not
only
because
of
their
award
winning
reporting
but
because
of
the
screen
adaptation
of
their
book
about
Watergate
All
the
President
s
Men

The
movie
came
out
in
and
starred
Robert
Redford
as
Woodward
and
Dustin
Hoffman
as
Bernstein

The
New
York
Times
called
it
a
spellbinding
detective
story


And
the
Post
once
described
All
the
President
s
Men
as
the
best
film
ever
made
about
the
craft
of
journalism


It
is
undoubtedly
the
most
viewed
of
the
handful
of
films
and
documentaries
about
Watergate
the
scandal
that
toppled
President
Richard
Nixon
and
sent
to
jail
men
associated
with
his
administration
or
his
re
election
campaign

All
the
President
s
Men
was
more
than
merely
entertaining

It
was
a
vehicle
for
propelling
and
solidifying
prominent
media
myths
of
Watergate
five
of
which
are
discussed
here
bold
The
Washington
Post
brought
down
Nixon
s
corrupt
presidency
bold
This
long
ago
became
the
dominant
narrative
of
the
Watergate
scandal

It
holds
that
Woodward
and
Bernstein
through
their
dogged
reporting
revealed
the
crimes
that
forced
Nixon
to
resign
the
presidency
in
August


That
s
also
the
inescapable
if
tacit
conclusion
of
the
movie
which
places
Woodward
and
Bernstein
at
the
centre
of
Watergate
s
unravelling
while
minimising
or
ignoring
the
far
more
decisive
contributions
of
subpoena
wielding
investigators

Rolling
up
a
scandal
of
Watergate
s
dimension
and
complexity
required
the
collective
efforts
of
special
prosecutors
federal
judges
both
houses
of
Congress
the
Supreme
Court
as
well
as
the
Justice
Department
and
the
FBI

Even
then
Nixon
likely
would
have
survived
the
scandal
if
not
for
the
audiotape
recordings
he
secretly
made
of
conversations
in
the
Oval
Office
of
the
White
House

Only
when
compelled
by
the
Supreme
Court
did
Nixon
surrender
the
recordings
which
captured
him
approving
a
plan
to
divert
the
FBI
s
investigation
of
the
break
in

Interestingly
principals
at
the
Washington
Post
have
periodically
scoffed
at
the
dominant
narrative
of
Watergate

Woodward
for
example
once
said
the
mythologising
of
our
role
in
Watergate
has
gone
to
the
point
of
absurdity
where
journalists
write
that
I
single
handedly
brought
down
Richard
Nixon

Totally
absurd


bold
The
Post
at
least
uncovered
the
Watergate
story
bold
Not
quite

Watergate
began
as
a
police
beat
story

News
of
the
scandal
s
seminal
crime
the
thwarted
break
in
of
June
at
the
headquarters
of
the
Democratic
National
Committee
at
the
Watergate
complex
in
Washington
DC
began
circulating
within
hours

The
opening
paragraph
of
the
Post
s
front
page
report
about
the
burglary
made
clear
that
the
details
had
come
from
investigators

It
read
Five
men
one
of
whom
said
he
is
a
former
employee
of
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency
were
arrested
at
a
m

yesterday
in
what
authorities
described
as
an
elaborate
plot
to
bug
the
offices
of
the
Democratic
National
Committee
here

Nor
did
the
Post
uncover
crucial
elements
of
the
deepening
scandal
such
as
Nixon
s
secret
taping
system

Existence
of
the
White
House
tapes
was
disclosed
in
to
an
investigating
committee
of
the
US
Senate

And
as
Edward
Jay
Epstein
pointed
out
in
a
brilliant
essay
in
the
Watergate
reporting
of
Woodward
and
Bernstein
was
often
derivative
and
sustained
by
leaks
from
federal
investigations
into
the
scandal

bold
The
stealthy
Watergate
source
Deep
Throat
famously
advised
Woodward
to
follow
the
money
bold
That
pithy
and
often
quoted
line
supposedly
was
the
key
to
unlocking
the
complexities
of
Watergate

In
fact
it
was
born
of
dramatic
licence

W
Mark
Felt
speaks
to
reporters
in
Image
caption
In
W
Mark
Felt
a
justice
department
official
confessed
that
he
was
Deep
Throat
Follow
the
money
was
spoken
not
by
the
real
life
Deep
Throat
source
but
by
Hal
Holbrook
the
actor
who
played
Deep
Throat
in
All
the
President
s
Men

In
real
life
the
Deep
Throat
source
conferred
periodically
with
Woodward
sometimes
in
an
underground
car
park
as
the
scandal
unfolded

But
he
did
not
advise
Woodward
to
follow
the
money


Woodward
and
Bernstein
were
already
on
the
money
trail
One
of
their
most
important
stories
was
to
describe
how
funds
donated
to
Nixon
s
re
election
campaign
had
been
used
for
the
Watergate
break
in

But
unravelling
the
scandal
was
far
more
demanding
than
following
the
money

Nixon
resigned
not
because
he
misused
funds
donated
to
his
campaign
but
because
he
clearly
obstructed
justice

Deep
Throat
by
the
way
revealed
himself
in
to
have
been
W
Mark
Felt
formerly
the
FBI
s
second
ranking
official

He
was
no
hero
though

Felt
was
convicted
in
on
felony
charges
related
to
break
ins
he
had
approved
in
the
FBI
s
investigations
into
the
radical
Weather
Underground
organisation

But
Felt
never
went
to
jail

He
was
pardoned
in
by
President
Ronald
Reagan

bold
Their
Watergate
reporting
placed
Woodward
and
Bernstein
in
grave
danger
bold
Hardly
although
All
the
President
s
Men
says
as
much

In
a
scene
near
the
close
of
the
movie
Deep
Throat
tells
Woodward
that
the
reporters
lives
are
in
danger


The
warning
which
injected
drama
into
the
movie
s
sometimes
leaden
pacing
also
was
mentioned
in
All
the
President
s
Men
the
book

However
it
was
fairly
quickly
determined
to
have
been
a
false
alarm

Robert
Redford
I
came
in
when
journalism
had
reached
an
apex
of
morality
and
professionalism
Woodward
Bernstein
and
senior
editors
at
the
Post
took
precautions
for
a
while
to
avoid
the
suspected
electronic
surveillance
of
their
activities

But
as
Woodward
recounted
in
The
Secret
Man
his
book
about
Deep
Throat
such
measures
soon
seemed
melodramatic
and
unnecessary

We
never
found
any
evidence
that
our
phones
were
tapped
or
that
anyone
s
life
was
in
danger


On
another
occasion
Woodward
said
the
most
sinister
pressure
he
and
Bernstein
felt
during
Watergate
was
the
repeated
denial
by
Nixon
s
White
House
of
the
information
we
were
publishing
as
the
scandal
deepened

bold
University
enrolments
in
journalism
courses
soared
because
of
Watergate
bold
It
s
an
appealing
subsidiary
myth
that
the
Watergate
exploits
of
Woodward
and
Bernstein
as
dramatised
by
Redford
and
Hoffman
made
journalism
seem
glamorous
and
alluring

So
alluring
that
young
Americans
in
the
s
supposedly
thronged
to
enrol
on
journalism
courses

It
s
a
myth
that
endures
despite
its
thorough
repudiation
by
scholarly
research

One
such
study
financed
by
the
Freedom
Forum
media
foundation
reported
in
that
growth
in
journalism
education
resulted
not
from
such
specific
events
as
Watergate
but
rather
to
a
larger
extent
from
the
appeal
of
the
field
to
women
who
have
been
attending
universities
in
record
numbers


The
study
was
unequivocal
in
stating
that
students
didn
t
come
rushing
to
the
university
because
they
wanted
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
Woodward
and
Bernstein
or
Robert
Redford
and
Dustin
Hoffman
for
that
matter


A
similar
study
released
in
declared
It
is
frequently
and
wrongly
asserted
that
the
investigative
reporting
of
Woodward
and
Bernstein
provided
popular
role
models
for
students
and
led
to
a
boom
in
journalism
school
enrolments

Instead
that
study
found
that
enrolments
already
had
doubled
between
and
the
year
of
the
Watergate
break

About
HuntingMarch
We
decided
to
write
this
page
because
of
continual
confusion
about
this
forum
s
stand
on
hunting

This
is
not
a
pro
hunting
blog
nor
an
anti
hunting
blog

There
is
a
good
reason

Bad
feeling
between
hunters
and
those
don
t
like
hunting
is
probably
the
single
biggest
reason
why
there
is
not
a
widespread
political
movement
to
protect
and
enhance
wildlife
and
wildlife
habitat
in
the
United
States

Part
of
this
split
is
philosophical
but
part
is
deliberately
stirred
up
by
those
who
have
other
political
and
economic
agendas

We
would
rather
not
have
discussions
about
the
wrongness
or
rightfulness
of
hunting
but
they
seem
unavoidable

However
we
will
step
in
when
they
get
personal
or
otherwise
out
of
hand

Rural
legends

Ralph
Maughan

It
was
suggested
in
another
thread
that
it
would
be
interesting
informative
and
useful
to
come
up
with
a
list
and
or
discuss
what
JB
has
called
rural
legends

These
would
be
similar
to
the
well
known
term
urban
legends
but
they
would
be
much
more
common
in
rural
areas
and
deal
with
the
outdoors
wildlife
hunting
and
fishing
farming
grazing
politics
related
to
these
things

So
let
s
see
if
we
can
discover
some

Already
a
number
or
people
have
described
the
belief
that
the
state
wildlife
department
or
the
federal
government
is
dropping
transplanting
turning
loose
various
kinds
of
undesirable
animals
in
rural
areas

I
first
heard
this
rumor
in
Idaho
in
the
early
s
when
there
was
the
persistent
rumor
that
Idaho
Fish
and
Game
was
turning
loose
bad
grizzly
bears
from
Yellowstone
Park
onto
Coolwater
Ridge
which
is
a
tall
and
broad
ridge
between
the
Selway
and
Lochsa
Rivers
in
north
central
Idaho
hundreds
of
miles
from
Yellowstone
Park

more
important
A
rural
legend
would
be
a
sub
class
of
urban
legends
according
the
the
Wikipedia
article
on
urban
legends

Despite
its
name
a
typical
urban
legend
does
not
necessarily
originate
in
an
urban
setting

The
term
is
simply
used
to
differentiate
modern
legend
from
traditional
folklore
in
preindustrial
times

For
this
reason
sociologists
and
folklorists
prefer
the
term
contemporary
legend

Urban
and
rural
legends
are
not
the
same
as
myths
but
they
are
related

Once
again
from
the
Wikipedia
The
earliest
term
by
which
these
narratives
were
known
urban
belief
tales
highlights
what
was
then
thought
to
be
a
key
property
they
were
held
by
their
tellers
to
be
true
accounts
and
the
device
of
the
FOAF
was
a
spurious
but
significant
effort
at
authentication

The
coinage
leads
in
turn
to
the
terms
FOAFlore
and
FOAFtale


While
at
least
one
classic
legend
the
Death
Car
has
been
shown
to
have
some
basis
in
fact
folklorists
as
such
are
interested
in
debunking
these
narratives
only
to
the
degree
that
establishing
non
factuality
warrants
the
assumption
that
there
must
be
some
other
reason
why
the
tales
are
told
and
believed

As
in
the
case
of
myth
these
narratives
are
believed
because
they
construct
and
reinforce
the
of
the
group
within
which
they
are
told
or
because
they
provide
us
with
coherent
and
convincing
explanations
of
complex
events
For
this
reason
it
is
characteristic
of
groups
within
which
a
given
narrative
circulates
to
react
very
negatively
to
claims
or
demonstrations
of
non
factuality
an
example
would
be
the
expressions
of
outrage
by
police
officers
who
are
told
that
adulteration
of
Halloween
treats
by
strangers
is
extremely
rare
if
it
has
occurred
at
all
or
the
vehement
responses

Where
to
begin
Let
s
see
Fish
Wildlife
brought
in
coyotes
to
kill
off
the
deer

Huh
When
coys
started
popping
up
in
KY
there
weren
t
that
many
deer
The
deer
population
has
just
exploded
in
the
last
or
so
years

The
reintroduced
elk
all
have
that
mad
cow
disease

Uh
no
or
at
least
to
the
best
of
the
state
veterinarian
s
knowledge
none
of
them
were
carrying
CWD

There
have
been
a
few
cases
of
some
type
of
a
brain
worm
but
no
CWD
thank
God
They
brought
in
bears
and
mountain
lions
to
kill
off
the
diseased
elk

See
previous
statement
hate
to
tell
em
but
there
were
lions
bears
in
the
mountains
of
Eastern
KY
loooong
before
the
elk
introduction
took
place
no
matter
what
the
powers
that
be
might
think
And
my
favorite
Fish
Wildlife
released
rattlesnakes
in
the
mountains
to
try
to
keep
out
hunters

Nope
they
ve
been
there
forever
too

But
I
ve
heard
that
a
lot
of
the
good
ol
boys
used
to
release
rattlesnakes
around
their
pot
fields
to
keep
people
from
looking
too
closely

That
one
s
most
likely
true

Oh
and
I
forgot
this
one
When
the
state
deer
population
was
hit
by
a
gnat
borne
hemorrhagic
syndrome
last
year
similar
to
blue
tongue
but
different
I
can
t
tell
you
how
many
people
I
tried
mostly
unsuccessfully
to
explain
to
that
it
wasn
t
mad
cow
disease
that
it
was
something
totally
different
The
usual
response
was
Well
that
s
what
they
want
you
to
think
Ahhh

Ralph
that
is
a
good
one



I
hope
it
was
true
The
legends
I
have
heard
from
around
here
are
the
same
ones
you
always
hear
everywhere
I
guess

Last
week
I
went
out
to
one
of
my
favorite
spots
in
Washington
and
ran
into
a
road
crew
that
was
fixing
the
road
I
wanted
to
go
down

It
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
the
work
had
stopped
but
the
security
guard
and
his
family
were
staying
the
night
there
to
watch
the
equipment

I
talked
with
him
about
a
slide
area
you
couldn
t
drive
around
which
they
had
fixed





and
then
he
mentioned
that
he
and
his
family
had
seen
a
huge
black
bear
about
lbs
and
that
there
were
a
couple
of
rigs
of
bear
hunters
chasing
him
right
then
and
that
the
big
bear
was
running
around
right
where
I
wanted
to
ride
my
bike

So
we
launched
into
a
talk
about
bears
and
he
told
me
after
he
realized
I
wasn
t
ascared
of
black
bears
that
now
grizzlies






that
s
another
thing
we
might
have
some
of
those
around
and
they
are
monsters




they
will
come
right
in
on
ya

I
wanted
to
get
on
to
what
I
came
to
do
so
I
cut
him
short
on
that
with
the
fact
that
I
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
them
in
Alaska
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
written
a
book
on
them

I
suspect
that
had
I
been
a
little
less
knowledgeable
about
bears
I
would
have
turned
around
and
gone
home



which
actually
I
did
after
I
tracked
the
bear
hunters
for
a
while
and
realized
that


the
bear
got
away
and


that
they
were
frustrated
and
on
the
ridge
above
me

I
am
way
more
ascared
of
a
rifle
than
a
bear

consumes
everything
in

A
couple
of

myths
wolves
have
never

attacked

are
decimating

populations
across

The
reintroduction
of
wolves
was
designed
to
drive
the
Western
livestock
industry
out
of
business



Salle
Avatar
Salle
August
And
The
wolves
were
also
reintroduced
to
kill
all
the
elk
so
that
they
could
close
down
hunting
and
ATVing
in
the
woods
in
order
to
drive
EVERYBODY
OUT
OF
THE
WOODS

And
then
you
know
the
moose
around
Yellowstone
are
decimated
by
the
wolves
AND
that
they
get
this
in
fifteen
years
time
have
evolved

Now
this
gets
interesting
because
there
are
TWO
evolution
stories
here
depending
on
which
they
you
re
going
for
here
a
the
moose
have
evolved
in
such
a
way
as
to
have
different
antlers
that
are
now
capable
of
scewering
two
wolves
in
one
swing
of
their
head
b
the
wolves
that
were
reintroduced
to
Yellowstone
in
were
NOT
the
first
reintroduction
attempt
this
last
century

They
were
actually
reintroduced
in
the
late
s
from
someplace
in
northern
Minnesota
and
let
out
somewhere
near
Gardiner
and
that
they
were
some
vicious
strain
of
powerwolf
but
the
ones
from
the
reintroduction
were
smaller
and
tamer
and
they
have
now
interbred
and
evolved
into
a
more
tolerable
strain
of
wolf

Though
they
have
still
over
populated
and
have
eaten
all
the
available
elk
to
date

Then
did
you
know
that
wolves
have
several
litters
of
pups
a
year
as
in
several
times
a
year
like
cats
can

They
never
told
me
about
these
things
in
genetics
class
And
I
didn
t
miss
a
lecture

Here
s
one
I
heard
at
the
gas
station
a
few
weeks
ago
The
government
wants
to
list
Polar
Bears
in
order
to
end
hunting

There
are
actually
lots
of
polar
bears
in
the
Arctic
but
the
government
changes
the
numbers
to
say
they
are
endangered
just
to
stop
all
bear
hunting
and
promote
the
environmentalist
global

Hal
and
JB
nailed
it

The
legend
of
the
introduced
insatiable
omnipotent
Canadian
Wolf
has
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
tales
ever
told

The
gist
being
that
somehow
the
feds
introduced
a
version
of
wolf
that
was
never
here
to
begin
with
and
outcompeted
the
version
of
the
wolf
that
was
already
here
in


This
alternate
strain
of
wolf
kills
everything
is
huge
and
wholly
fearless
of
humans

Oh
and
it
has
no
morals
unlke
its
smaller
kind
hearted
and
apparently
herbivorian
brother
that
was
here
originally

I
guess
my
question
is
this
do
people
really
think
wolves
recognize
or
have
ever
recognized
international
borders
If
you
believe
this
legend
then
you
believe
that
wolves
in
Idaho
did
not
historically
intermingle
with
wolves
in
Canada

Ever

But
alas
logic
does
not
rule
the
day
and
I
am
merely
laughed
at
by
the
fiends
in
their
Spire
of

And
I

I

to

I

that

not

a

Changing
the
subject
from

there
is
legend
that
the

of

been
neatly

by

Yes
that
would
be
a
myth
but
to
say
that
wolves
primarily
kill
the
old
the

and
the

would
be
accurate

I
think
that
is
what

correct

on

from

of

The
one
about
wolves
being
overpopulated
now
is
widespread
I
hear
it
from
tourists
from
other
areas
of
the
country

They
know
next
to
nothing
a
great
number
of
the
folks
I
encounter
at
least
the
media
doesn
t
cover
it
much
and
certainly
doesn
t
care
to
include
too
much
content
when
they
do
cover
wolf
issues

did
you
mean
to

there
is
legend
that
the
grazing
of
the

by
buffalo
has

by
grazing

I

Entire
herds
and
flocks
being
obliterated
in
one
night

The
wolf
s
utter
incapacity
to
control
their
own
number
without
human
management

Wolves
and
coyotes
interbreeding
super
hyper
killer
mutant

An
insatiable
longing
to
stalk
and
kill
children
not
to
mention
any

no

parents


The
act
of
making
carcass
wards
to
scare
other
wolves
off
a
ranch
unfortunately
only
humans
react
to
such
things


Personally
I
think
its
just
showing
off
could
be
mistaken

Wolves
when
hunting
Tearing
foetuses
out
of
a
living
mother
ungulate
Eating
their
prey
alive
sometimes
but
not
a
frequent
occurrence
Being
cruel
when
killing
and
thoroughly
enjoying
the
act
Then
again
we
ve
also
got
the
guys
who
accept
the
wolf
as
a
predator
aka
something
that
needs
to
be
shot
on
sight
because
it
spoils
happy
time

wait
we
forgot
the
one
where
wolves
were
reintroduced
by
vegatarians
so
thatthey
could
kill
the
cows
off
and
woves
were
an
environmentalist
scheme
to
kill
all
the
cattle
on
public
lands


the
pine
beetle
problem
is
a
result
of
the
government
trying
to
use
them
to
control
weeds
wolves
would
have
died
out
in
the
Rockies
even
if
they
hadn
t
been
hunted
to
extinction
there


wolves
kill
every
animal
they
come
across
and
leave
them
there
to
rot


all
hunters
want
to
keep
elk
feeding
grounds
so
they
can
shoot
bigger
bulls
and
get
more
cow
tags
every

is
a

I
really
don
t
know
why
you
think
that
the
only
useful
animal
to
a
hunter
is
one
that
he
can
kill

Most
true
sportsmen
enjoy
all
the
critters
and
yes
even
the
wolves
at
times

As
far
as
bigfoot
tags
go
I
really
don
t
feel
there
numbers
are
great
enough
yet
for
a
season
and
personally
I
hope
no
matter
how
many
there
are
they
won
t
open
a
season

I
would
however
like
to
train
one
to
pack
out
my
elk

I
actually
own
an
atv
but
I
don
t
hunt
from
it
and
with
me
getting
older
I
can
t
pack
as
well
as
I
used
to

I
ve
been
told
though
that
the
bigfoot
is
really
fond
of
jerky
and
with
the
right
jerky
you
can
get
them
to
do
almost
anything

I
ve
never
tried
b
bq
rats
or
bigfoot
but
with
enough
catsup
you
can
make
anything
taste
better
probably
even
a
wolf

Little
bit
out
of
this
topic
here
nevertheless
I
have
no
problem
at
all
with
hunting
in
general
hunting
for
food
delicious
to
be
precise

This
however
does
not
include
what
in
Africa
is
called
hunting
bushmeat
animals
that
are
not
really
edible


I
have
however
a
problem
with
huting
in
so
far
as
over
the
centuries
countless
species
have
been
driven
into
extinction
or
to
near
extinction
by
over
hunting

I
have
a
severe
problem
with
ego
hunting

With
the
sportsmen
a
term
left
over
from
the
glory
days
of
hunting
in
the
commonwealth
I
think
putting
the
lights
out
of
a
bear
a
tiger
a
lion
a
buffalo
a
coyote
an
elk
a
wolf
or
whatever
it
is
just
for
the
fun
of
it
just
because
one
is
able
to
do
so
Just
to
show
with
a
pelt
hanging
near
the
fireplace
what
a
tough
guy
one
is

Just
to
prove
with
a
picture
where
one
is
posing
with
a
sheepish
grin
behind
a
bear
carcass
or
even
worse
with
one
foot
on
this
carcass

I
honestly
dislike
the
hypocritical
is
this
the
appropriate
word
attitude
of
our
german
hunting
organisations
We
accept
the
presence
of
those
wolves
only
if
we
are
allowed
to
manage
them

Pennsylvania

around
at

in

but
that
doesn
t
stop
some
folks
from
reporting
having
seen
a
wolf
or
wolves
in
the
state
or
Northeast

Here
s
a
comment
one
of
my

s
recent
postings
elicited
from
a
reader

Cougars

mill
participants
wouldn
t
one
have
been
road
killed
by
now
given
the
presence
of
so
many
roads
on
the
landscape


I
saw
a
black
wolf
in
SW
Pennsylvania
years
ago

At
first
it
looked
like
a
small
medium
bear
due
to
distance


I
ran
to
my
truck
to
grab
my
spotting
scope
and
was
surprised
to
see
that
is
was
a
wolf

I
am
a
Biologist
and
so
is
one
other
person
that
was
in
our
group

There
is
no
chance
that
this
animal
was
a
coyote

I
have
lived
in
close
proximity
to
several
packs
over
the
years
and
I
know
this
animal
was
no
coyote

I
m
also
willing
to
wager
that
it
was
no
wild
dog

Unfortunately
it
was
too
far
away
to
get
decent
photos
but
with
the
spotting
scope
we
got
very
good
looks

my

comments
I
remember
hearing
a
story
from
an

about
how
he
was
confronted
by
someone
in
Riggins
Idaho
about
how
the
IDFG
was
stocking
grizzly
bears
wolves
and
rattlesnakes
in
the
area

I
ve
also
heard
the
stories
about
Yellowstone
rangers
being
asked
questions
like
Why
do
they
put
the
blue
stuff
in
the
lake
Why
are
the
those
little
red
dogs
hanging
out
with
the
buffalo
When
do
the
deer
turn
into
elk
moose
As
a
fisheries
person
I
overheard
someone
explaining
that
the
trout
hanging
out
with
the
salmon
were
bull
trout
that
were
going
to
dig
up
the
eggs
so
they
could
eat
them

They
were
actually
jack
Chinook
salmon
or
males
that
only
spend
one
year
in
the
ocean
as
compared
to
or
three

FYI
they
die
just

the

of
them

The
first
outlined
stage
is
a
scarcity
of
wild
game
be
it
due
to
habitat
loss
seasonal
migration
or
often
times
over
predation

Wolves
begin
approaching
human
habitations
though
limiting
their
visits
to
nocturnal
hours

Their
presence
is
usually
established
by
barking
matches
with
local
dogs

After
a
certain
amount
of
time
wolves
begin
to
frequent
human
habitations
in
daylight
hours
and
observe
people
and
livestock
at
a
distance

The
wolves
begin
acting
bolder
by
attacking
small
stock
and
pets
at
daylight
sometimes
pursuing
their
prey
up
to
verandas

The
wolves
at
this
point
do
not
focus
on
humans
but
will
growl
and
act
threateningly
toward
them

The
wolves
begin
attacking
large
bodied
livestock
and
may
follow
riders

People
begin
to
be
harassed
usually
in
a
playful
manner

The
wolves
will
chase
people
over
short
distances
and
nip
at
them
though
will
retreat
if
confronted

Wolves
begin
to
attack
people
in
predatory
fashions

I

will
attack
people
for
food
as
well
as
self
defense
but
that
other

only
attack

in

Then
I

will
attack

for

Let
s
not

the
wily
critter
of
the
plains
and
sagebrush

The
trophy
Jack
a
lope

A
friend
of
mine
had
a
sporting
goods
store
in
western
colorado
when
I
lived
there

I
would
help
him
out
at
times
with
bore
sighting
rifles
for
the
out
of
state
hunters
that
would
come
into
the
store
to
buy
their
elk
and
deer
tags

He
had
a
Jack
a
lope
mount
on
the
wall
and
you
wouldn
t
believe
how
many
people
would
belive
that
he
had
actually
taken
it
not
miles
from
the
store
some
even
asked
if
they
had
tags
available

Those
are
the
years
I
wore
extra
orange
during
the
season
and
probably
a
big
reason
I
started
archery
hunting
more
than

Actually
black
bears
have
attacked
more
people
than
any
of
the
others
but
there
are
more
black
bears
living
where
there
are
more
people
so
there
are
more
encounters

Personally
I
don
t
trust
any
of
them
and
respect
all
the
predators
actually
all
wild
animals

The
only
bear
I
ve
ever
had
to
dispose
of
had
been
wounded
a
week
prior
to
our
meeting
by
some
other
hunters
that
made
a
bad
shot
he
fell
seven
feet
from
my
rifle
barrel
and
scared
the
hell
out
of
me
at
full
charge
this
however
is
not
normal
and
he
was
a
black

I
ve
had
black
bears
close
several
times
and
they
will
dance
on
there
forepaws
back
and
forth
woofing
and
huffing
sometimes
popping
their
teeth
so
loud
you
would
think
they
would
break
but
every
time
I
ve
seen
this
I
back
out
slowly
and
other
than
maybe
having
to
clean
out
my
drawers
haven
t
had
problem

I
ve
read
many
books
on
documented
bear
attacks
and
all
species
will
attack
under
the
right
circumstances

The
main
thing
to
do
when
in
the
woods
I
think
is
mainly
be
aware
of
your
surroundings
pay
attention
to
the
tracks
and
scat
certain
areas
during
certain
times
of
the
year
are
used
more
often
than
others
by
bears

Personally
in
North
Idaho
we
have
more
encounters
with
moose
than
bears

Their
big
and
can
get
kind
of
crazy
during
the
rut
and

season

vicki
I
was
just
wondering
where
they
were
taken
but
there
was
nothing
there
except
rocky
mountains


So
do
black
bears
attack
people
and
deer
etc

for
food
regularly
I
was
under
the
impression
that
like
wolves
they
normally
kept
to
smaller
stuff
and
fish
and
being
omnivorous
also
relied
on
vegetation
so
that
they
normally
left
people
alone

I
know
about
the
tying
up
your
grub
when
you
re
out
there
so
the
bears
won
t
get
it
but
there
s
never
really
any
warning
about
the
bears
getting
You
unless
you
come

He
then
tells
them
that
they
need
to
recognize
the
bear
s
scat
so
they
can
tell
the
two
species
apart

He
sez
that
black
bears
are
much
less
likely
to
attack
so
when
they
see
black
bear
scat
they
may
continue

But
if
they
encounter
grizzly
scat
they
should
give
the
area
a
wide
berth

A
tourist
asks
how
to
tell
the
difference

The
ranger
replies
Easy
black
bears
are
grazers
more
than
fish
eaters

The
black
bear
scat
is
usually
full
of
blackberry
seeds
hackberrys
and
acorns
and
other
plant
life
and
it
smells
like
almonds

Grizzly
scat
is
larger
and
it
is
full
of
bells
and
smells
like
pepper
spray

What
makes
a
scary
movie
extra
creepy
We
would
argue
it
s
the
specter
of
truth
that
something
bad
or
spooky
can
happen
because
we
heard
it
happened
for
real
somewhere

Enter
urban
legends

Stories
are
passed
down
through
generations
they
always
have
been

And
sometimes
unexplained
rumors
of
something
that
happened
to
someone
somewhere
can
gain
powerful
momentum
if
enough
folks
keep
those
stories
alive
with
new
details
and
new
audiences

Urban
legends
play
on
our
biggest
fears
of
the
unknown
that
something
sinister
could
be
lurking
in
a
place
or
situation
we
otherwise
feel
safe
in

But
they
re
also
fantastic
jumping
off
points
for
movies
and
more
stories

We
pulled
together
a
list
of
some
of
the
creepiest
movies
based
on
or
surrounding
urban
legends
just
in
time
for
your
Halloween
watch
party

The
Ring
BUTTON
urban
legends
the
ring
rmrk
st
Remarkist
Magazine
The
movie
The
Ring
inspired
by
the
Japanese
horror
film
Ringu
itself
inspired
by
the
novel
Ring
by
Koji
Suzuki
relies
on
the
urban
legend
of
a
cursed
videotape
that
when
watched
leads
to
the
viewer
s
death
seven
days
later
unless
they
can
solve
the
mystery
surrounding
it

This
concept
of
a
cursed
video
or
image
leading
to
doom
is
linked
to
several
urban
legends
but
one
of
the
most
prominent
is
the
Japanese
kuchisake
onna
Slit
Mouthed
Woman
legend
where
a
vengeful
female
spirit
appears
with
a
disfigured
face
and
asks
potential
victims
if
they
find
her
beautiful

Depending
on
their
answer
she
either
kills
them
or
harms
them

The
Ring
urban
legend
plays
on
the
broader
concept
of
a
jinx
or
cursed
media
where
engaging
with
specific
content
like
a
tape
or
photo
has
a
supernatural
consequence

The
idea
of
cursed
objects
or
communication
causing
death
has
a
long
history
in
folklore
worldwide
ranging
from
cursed
paintings
to
cursed
phone
numbers

The
cursed
videotape
in
The
Ring
serves
as
a
modern
adaptation
of
these
older
legends



Candyman
BUTTON
urban

candyman
rmrk

Remarkist

Have
you
ever
been
at
a
sleepover
and
gathered
with
friends
in
the
bathroom
to
chant
Bloody
Mary
while
staring
into
the
mirror
Just
us
Well
the
horror
film
Candyman
is
based
on
author
Clive
Barker
s
short
story
The
Forbidden
but
it
is
heavily
influenced
by
urban
legends
particularly
Bloody
Mary

In
this
story
however
the
ghost
of
a
hook
handed
man
appears
when
someone
says
his
name
five
times
in
front
of
a
mirror

It
s
giving
Beetlejuice

This
directly
ahem
mirrors
the
Bloody
Mary
game
in
which
a
spirit
is
said
to
appear
when
her
name
is
chanted
multiple
times
while
looking
in
a
mirror

Both
legends
involve
summoning
a
deadly
supernatural
entity
through
a
ritual
usually
a
dare

Candyman
also
has
another
important
element
that
often
goes
hand
in
hand
with
urban
legends
the
theme
of
racial
violence
and
injustice

The
backstory
of
the
Candyman
character
is
that
he
was
a
Black
artist
named
Daniel
Robitaille
who
was
brutally
lynched
in
the
late
th
century
for
having
a
romantic
relationship
with
a
white
woman

He
was
tortured
by
having
his
hand
cut
off
and
replaced
with
a
hook
and
this
racially
charged
backstory
makes
Candyman
a
complex
blend
of
horror
and
commentary
on
the
historical
mistreatment
of
Black
people

The
setting
of
the
film
further
digs
into
the
often
unfair
and
racially
charged
fears
and
anxieties
of
urban
life
including
poverty
and
crime

Based
on
Lois
Duncan
s
novel
of
the
same
name
the
slasher
film
I
Know
What
You
Did
Last
Summer
is
inspired
by
a
famous
urban
legend

Often
referred
to
as
The
Hook
or
The
Hookman
the
legend
features
a
hook
handed
killer
who
stalks
and
attacks
young
couples
often
parked
in
a
secluded
lover
s
lane
area

A
couple
hears
a
news
report
on
the
radio
about
an
escaped
mental
patient
or
killer
with
a
hook
for
a
hand

They
become
frightened
and
decide
to
leave
the
area
only
to
later
discover
a
hook
hanging
from
the
car
door
suggesting
the
killer
was
recently
nearby

The
story
plays
on
fears
of
vulnerable
teens
being
attacked
in
isolated
locations

In
I
Know
What
You
Did
Last
Summer
a
group
of
teenagers
accidentally
hit

man
with
their
car
and
thinking
he

A
year

messages
from
someone
who
says
they
know
what
they
did
and
soon
begin
being
stalked
by
a

the
origin
is
still
there



Slender
Man

rmrk
st
Remarkist

Born
from
a
modern
urban
legend
that
originated
in
the
digital
space
as
opposed
to
urban
legends
that
are
passed
down
through
stories
over
decades
the
Slender
Man
was
created
in
by
Eric
Knudsen
alias
Victor
Surge
on
the
online
forum
Something
Awful

It
quickly
took
on
a
life
of
its
own
and
became
an
internet
myth
gaining
widespread
influence
as
other
users
contributed
additional
stories
artwork
and
videos
to
the
character
s
lore

Slender
Man
is
typically
depicted
as
a
tall
thin
figure
with
a
featureless
white
face
and
tentacle
like
appendages

He
is
often
shown
wearing
a
black
suit
and
he
stalks
abducts
or
influences
children
and
teens
leading
them
into
forests
or
causing
them
to
act
irrationally

The
character
s
lack
of
distinct
features
makes
him
especially
unsettling
and
he
has
become
associated
with
psychological
horror
and
the
idea
of
losing
control
to
a
mysterious
force

The
movie
Slender
Man
is
about
a
group
of
teenage
girls
who
summon
the
Slender
Man
through
an
online
ritual
and
then
find
themselves
haunted
by
him

The
film
taps
into
fears
around
the
dangers
of
the
internet
how
myths
and
memes
can
spiral
into
something
terrifying
and
how
they
can
influence
vulnerable
minds

In
a
tragic
real
life
twist
this
urban
legend
was
also
tied
to
a
real
life
incident
in
when
two
year
old
girls
in
Wisconsin
stabbed
a
classmate
in
an
attempt
to
appease
Slender
Man
believing
that
they
would
become
his
proxies

While
the
film
does
not
directly
address
the
crime
the
real
world
implications
of
the
Slender
Man
legend
added
an
additional
layer
of
creepiness
to
the
character

rmrk
st
Remarkist
Magazine
The
film
based
on
John
Keel
s
book
of
the
same
name
The
Mothman
Prophecies
was
inspired
by
real
life
events
and
an
urban
legend
surrounding
the
mysterious
creature
known
as
the
Mothman

The
legend
originates
from
sightings
in
the
small
town
of
Point
Pleasant
West
Virginia
during
the
mid
s

Keel
s
book
explores
his
investigations
into
the
sightings
and
their
possible
connection
to
supernatural
phenomena
and
tragic
events

In
gravediggers
in
Clendenin
West
Virginia
claimed
to
have
seen
a
large
humanoid
figure
with
wings
flying
overhead
and
two
young
couples
reported
seeing
a
man
sized
creature
with
large
wings
and
glowing
red
eyes
who
could
fly
at
incredibly
high
speeds
and
follow
their
car
as
they
fled
the
area

Over
the
next
year
many
residents
of
Point
Pleasant
reported
sightings
of
the
Mothman
and
in
some
cases
witnesses
experienced
feelings
of
dread
anxiety
or
paranormal
events
after
encountering
the
creature

In
the
Silver
Bridge
which
connected
Point
Pleasant
to
Ohio
over
the
Ohio
River
suddenly
collapsed
killing
people

The
collapse
was
attributed
to
a
structural
failure
but
many
locals
believed
that
the
Mothman
sightings
were
an
omen
predicting
the
disaster
and
after
it
happened
there
were
less
reports
of
Mothman
sightings

In
the
movie
a
journalist
played
by
Richard
Gere
investigates
the
strange
sightings
and
prophetic
warnings
in
a
small
town

Using
the
real
life
reports
and
the
Silver
Bridge
disaster
as
a
backdrop
the
film
amplifies
the
eerie
idea
that
the
Mothman
may
be
a
supernatural
being
or
entity
that
foreshadows
catastrophe
weaving
elements
of
mystery
paranoia
and
the
unexplained
into
the
narrative



Blair

Project
BUTTON

project

rmrk
st
Remarkist

This
movie
wasn
t
based
on
an
urban
legend
per
se
but
it
used
the
idea
of
urban
legends
and
folklore
to
scare
viewers

Also
The
filmmakers
created
and
disseminated
a
fictional
urban
legend
of
their
own
to
promote
the
film
of
course

Early
internet
culture
helped
to
make
their
fictional
legend
seem
real
the
filmmakers
created
a
website
that
presented
the
Blair
Witch
story
as
genuine
folklore
complete
with
fake
newspaper
articles
journal
entries
and
missing
person
reports
about
the
disappearance
of
the
film
s
protagonists

This
viral
marketing
campaign
which
blurred
the
line
between
reality
and
fiction
how
quaint
to
imagine
this
in
modern
day
smartly
mimicked
the
way
urban
legends
spread
in
the
modern
age
using
the
internet
as
a
new
medium
for
word
of
mouth

The
legend
in
the
movie
was
designed
to
feel
like
an
authentic
ancient
myth
and
the
film
cleverly
presents
it
as
if
it
were
real
using
a
found
footage
style
to
add
to
the
illusion
of
authenticity

In
it
three
student
filmmakers
Heather
Josh
and
Mike
venture
into
the
woods
near
Burkittsville
Maryland
in
to
make
a
documentary
about
the
Blair
Witch
legend

According
to
this
fictional
lore
which
we
see
play
out
in
The
Blair
Witch
Project
the
Blair
Witch
is
a
vengeful
spirit
tied
to
the
town
of
Burkittsville
formerly
called
Blair


The
legend
spans
centuries
beginning
with
the
story
of
Elly
Kedward
a
woman
accused
of
witchcraft
in
and
banished
to
the
woods
after
children
accused
her
of
luring
them
to
her
house
to
draw
blood

Kedward
was
presumed
to
have
died
in
the
wilderness
but
soon
after
her
disappearance
the
townspeople
began
to
vanish
and
the
remaining
villagers
abandoned
Blair
convinced
that
the
area
was
cursed

The
legend
suggests
that
Kedward
s
spirit
known
as
the
Blair
Witch
haunted
the
woods
around
Burkittsville
causing
mysterious
disappearances
and
deaths
over
the
years

The
legend
goes
further
citing
the
abduction
of
a
group
of
children
in
the
s
by
a
man
named
Rustin
Parr
who
killed
them
in
his
cabin
claiming
that
the
Blair
Witch
made
him
do
it

All
of
this
lore
adds
to
the
realness
of
this
fake
documentary
style
movie
and
it
even
fooled
some
audiences
into
believing
that
the
legend
really
existed

st

Finally
the
horror
film
Urban
Legend
illustrates
exactly
why
urban
legends
are
excellent
fodder
for
a
scary
movie

Set
on
a
college
campus
a
series
of
gruesome
student
murders
start
happening
and
they
seem
to
reflect
commonly
known
urban
legends

Indeed
the
killer
in
the
film
uses
these
legends
as
inspiration
for
creative
killings
and
the
plot
heavily
relies
on
the
audience
recognizing
these
myths

Among
the
common
urban
legends
depicted
are
the
lover
s
lane
hookman
very
I
Know
What
You
Did
Last
Summer
a
killer
hiding
in
the
backseat
waiting
to
strike
the
call
coming
from
inside
the
house
the
Bloody
Mary
myth
pop
rocks
and
soda
combo
death
flashing
headlight
gang
initiations
kidney
heist
organ
theft
and
more

The
film
helps
perpetuate
these
urban
legend
fears
and
that
of
course
makes
it
easier
to
build
a
franchise
of
sequels
But
one
thing
is
made
clear
urban
legends
will
always
be
passed
from
generation
to
generation
and
like
story
tropes
serve
as
endless
inspiration

Being
born
on
March
and
having
an
Irish
surname
leads
me
to
have
more
reflections
and
conversations
about
St

Patrick
s
Day
than
the
average
person
as
I
wrote
two
years
ago

This
time
we
re
going
to
look
at
some
of
the
myths
related
to
the
man
St

Patrick

Shamrocks
Legend
has
it
that
British
born
St

Patrick
used
a
shamrock
to
teach
Irish
pagans
about
the
trinity

However
there
s
a
few
problems
with
this
The
word
shamrock
doesn
t
come
into
use
until
a
thousand
years
after
St

Patrick
s
death
and
it
took
nearly
as
long
for
this
legend
to
develop

There
s
disagreement
on
if
there
actually
is
such
a
thing
as
a
shamrock
and
if
it
they
exist
if
they
re
capable
of
growing
in
non
Irish
soil

Most
significantly
St

Patrick
never
alludes
to
anything
like
this
in
his
only
two
extant
writings
the
Confessio
and
the
Epistola

Aside
from
these
two
documents
we
really
don
t
know
anything
else
about
Ireland
s
British
Bishop

Snakes
Ever
heard
about
St

Patrick
chasing
all
the
snakes
out
of
Ireland
Uh
uh

Nope

Didn
t
happen
since
the
island
never
had
snakes

And
again
he
never
wrote
anything
about
chasing
killing
or
even
screaming
and
running
away
from
snakes

Nobody
mentions
this
legend
until
years
after
the
approximate
date
of
his
death

And
about
that
date

March
is
said
to
be
St

Patrick
s
date
of
death
not
birth

Nobody
recorded
the
date
it
just
showed
up
on
liturgical
calendar
centuries
later

Slavery
Patrick
s
father
had
a
successful
business
enriched
by
slave
labor

Ironically
Patrick
was
kidnapped
from
Britain
and
sold
into
slavery
in
Ireland
at
age


After
six
years
a
slave
Patrick
escaped
back
to
Britain

He
trained
for
the
ministry
and
dreamed
that
God
was
calling
him
to
go
back
to
preach
in
Ireland

He
was
enslaved
again
for
a
short
period
of
time
but
Patrick
refused
to
be
deterred
from
his
purpose
describing
himself
as
being
bound
by
the
Spirit
to
minister
in
the
land
of
his
captivity

Souls
over
Gold
As
soon
as
Valentine
s
Day
ends
naked
cupids
are
displaced
by
leprechauns
clothed
thankfully
on
retail
shelves

Is
this
a
case
of
Roman
icons
being
gentrified
by
Irish
ones
Anyway
the
clever
little
creatures
with
pots
of
gold
at
the
end
of
rainbows
have
nothing
to
do
with
St

Patrick

This
saint
developed
a
love
for
souls
over
gold
and
argued
for
people
to
be
prized
over
possessions

St

Patrick
wrote
his
fiery
Epistola
as
a
call
for
repentance
and
reparations
from
those
who
had
killed
enslaved
and
sold
women
and
men
he
had
just
baptized
and
anointed

In
doing
so
he
was
putting
his
life
on
the
line
for
a
wholistic
ministry

He
wasn
t
satisfied
with
people
s
soul
s
being
saved
while
their
bodies
were
in
bondage
It
is
not
that
I
would
choose
to
let
anything
so
blunt
and
harsh
come
from
my
mouth
but
I
am
driven
by
the
zeal
for
God

And
the
truth
of
Christ
stimulates
me
for
love
of
neighbors
and
children
for
these
I
have
given
up
my
homeland
and
my
parents
and
my
very
life
to
death
The
Most
High
does
not
accept
the
gifts
of
evildoers

The
one
who
offers
a
sacrifice
taken
from
what
belongs
to
the
poor
is
like
one
who
sacrifices
a
child
in
the
very
sight
of
the
child
s
father

Riches
says
Scripture
which
a
person
gathers
unjustly
will
be
vomited
out
of
that
person
s
stomach

The
angel
of
death
will
drag
such
a
one
away
to
be
crushed
by
the
anger
of
dragons

St

Patrick
continued
by
urging
his
followers
to
resist
flattering
these
traffickers
and
to
boycott
them
instead
A
ll
the
holy
and
humble
of
heart
should
not
fawn
on
such
people
nor
even
share
food
or
drink
with
them
nor
accept
their
alms
until
such
time
as
they
make
satisfaction
to
God
in
severe
penance
and
shedding
of
tears
and
until
they
set
free
the
men
servants
of
God
and
the
baptised
women
servants
of
Christ
for
whom
he
died
and
was
crucified

Shouldn
t
commemorations
of
St

Patrick
s
legacy
set
higher
goals
than
wearing
green
clothes
eating
green
cookies
and
cupcakes
and
turning
rivers
green
for
a
day
Why
not
draft
modern
versions
of
the
Epistola
instead
of
getting
drunk
on
green
beer
