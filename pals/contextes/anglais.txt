Many
urban
legends
are
framed
as
complete
stories
with
plot
and
characters

The
compelling
appeal
of
a
typical

is
its
elements
of
mystery
horror

or
humor

Often
they
serve
as
Elements
of
shock
value
can
be
found
in
almost
every
form
of
urban

and
are
partially
what
makes
these
tales
so
impactful

include
elements
of

was
forwarded

at

shown
to
have

We
all
know
that
the
Slender
Man
is
nothing
more
than
a
pure
urban
legend
created
online
in
on
an
Internet
forum

However
since
then
it
has
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own
even
being
connected
with
physical
sense
the
belief
in
him
by
some
has
made
the
consequences
of
the
legend
very
real
for
some

Here
are
ten
very
unsettling
points
about
the

and
reality
of
the

As
more
and
more
people
became
aware
of
Slender
Man
and
added
their
own
details
and
little
pieces
of
the
backstory
the
legend
grew

In
fact
this
creation
of
a
legend
by
the
audience
themselves
is
the
subject
of
our
next
point

this
growth
can
be
monitored

For
example
there
is
a
collective

to

growth

the

legend
as
we

The
Slender

legend
had
very
quickly
taken
on
a
life
of
its

like

and
folklore
of
the

years

On
May
the
Slender
Man
or
at
least
the
consequences
of
the
legend
spilled
over
into
the
real
world
in
a
very
dramatic
way

On
the
morning
in
question
two
year
old
girls
Anissa
Weier
and
Morgan
killer
and
his
wife
was
connected
to
the
Slender

after

the

that
he
would
often

publicity
that
the
Slender
Man
was
receiving
at
this
stage
it
is
perhaps
easy
to
understand
how
some
in
the
media
connected
the
legend
of
the
suicide
spirit
and
this
new
urban

subconscious
fear
of
the
Slender
Man
legends

It
is
interesting
to
note
once
more
though
that
the
fine
line
in
a
person
believing
in
a
legend
suddenly
making
it
real
is
indeed
delicate
in
the
extreme

is
they
know

And
although
they
understand
at
least
for
the
most
part
that
he
is
nothing
more
than
an
urban
legend
he
is
without
a
doubt
in
their
collective
subconscious

Of
course
where
the
legend
of
the
Slender
Man
goes
from
here
remains
to
be
seen

Perhaps
he
will
still
be

The
article
The

of
Master

written
by
Joshuah
Bearman
and
appearing
in
the
January
edition
of
Rolling
Stone
was
my
and
very
different
e
mails

One
was
from
someone
telling
me
what
a
great
awesome
guy
Master
legend
was
and
that
I
should
get
in
contact
with
him

A
second
e
mail
told
me
that
Master
legend
was
a
nutjob
and
they
were
sick
of
writers
using
him
as
a
representative
of
the
RLSH
repeatedly
during
my
course
of
writing
about
RLSH

PRO
legend
Tales
of

Book
Bravado
and

Something
that
appeals
to
some
RLSH
about
Master
legend
is
that
he
is
very
dynamic
and
energetic

He
is
often
documented
running
jumping
wild
action
packed
and
never
a
snoozefest

Some
of
them
are
fantastic
and
we
must
take
them
at
Master
legend
s
word
since
the
only
witnesses
are
Master
legend
himself
and
the
claimed
league
of
frightened
criminals
who
have
had
the
misfortune
of
it

This
guy
known
as
Big
Red
has
been
terrorizing
my
homeless
friends
but
now
it
s
time
to
meet
the
legend


This
guy
has
tried
to
evade
me
because
he
knows
of
the
whispered
tales
behind
shuttered
doors
of
Master
legend


He
has
a
few
punks
that
do
crack
friends
so
I
got
Brimstone
to
come
along
for
been
running
his
mouth
out
in
the
streets
saying
he
can

alike

Acting
as
a
Media
Ambassador
Besides
the
Rolling
Stone
article
mentioned
Master
legend
has
attracted
media
attention
from
around
the
world
and
for
many
some
kind
and
strangely
has
even
had
talks
about
his
own
cooking
show
Some
RLSH
say
this
media
attention
is
not
just
good
for
Master
legend
but
good
for
RLSH
in
general

Not
only
that
but
Master
legend
runs
his
own
RLSH
forum
leading
a
platoon
at
the
Master

and
recently
began

The

who
s
in

took
a

and
tracked

down

Based
on

he
figured

might
be
a

And
sure
enough
the

tells
me
I

The

goes
on
to
say
that
he
flees
the
scene
when
someone
comes
across
it
and
says

Master

says
call

gives
the

his

before
heading
to
a
pizza

and
ordering

The

from

Despite
its
name
a
typical
urban

does
not
necessarily
originate
in
an
urban
setting

The
term
is
simply
used
to
differentiate
modern
legend
from
traditional
folklore
in
preindustrial
times

For
this
reason
sociologists
and
folklorists
prefer
the
term
contemporary

coinage
leads
in

to
the
terms
FOAFlore
and

Depending
on

she
either

or

The
Ring
urban
legend
plays
on
the
broader
concept
of
a
jinx
or
cursed
media
where
engaging
film
I
Know
What
You
Did
Last
Summer
is
inspired
by
a
famous
urban
legend


Often
referred
to
as
The
Hook
or
The
Hookman
the
legend
features
a
hook
handed
killer
who
stalks
and
attacks
young
couples
who
says
they
know
what
they
did
and
soon
begin
being
stalked
by
a
killer
wielding
a
hook

The
movie
expands
the
original
urban
legend
but
the
origin
is
still
there

Born
from
a
modern
urban
legend
that
originated
in
the
digital
space
as
opposed
to
urban
legends
that
are
passed
down
through
stories
over
how
they
can
influence
vulnerable
minds

In
a
tragic
real
life
twist
this
urban
legend
was
also
tied
to
a
real
life
incident
in
when
two
year
old
girls
in
Wisconsin
stabbed
a
classmate

an
attempt
to
While
the
film

address
the
crime
the
real
world
implications
of
the
Slender

added
an
additional
layer
of
creepiness
to
the
character

The
film
based
on
John
Keel
s
book
of
the
same
name
The
Mothman
Prophecies
was
inspired
by
real
life
events
and
an
urban
legend
surrounding
the
mysterious
creature
known
as
the
Mothman

The
legend
originates
from
sightings
in
the
small
town
of
Point
Pleasant
West
This
movie
wasn
t
based
on
an
urban
legend
per
se
but
it
used
the
idea
of
urban
legends
and
folklore
to
scare
viewers

Also
The
filmmakers
created
and
disseminated
a
fictional
urban
legend
of
their
own
to
promote
the
film
of
course

Early
internet
culture
helped
to
make
their
fictional
legend
seem
real
the
filmmakers
created
a
website
that
presented
the
Blair

story
as
genuine
folklore
complete
with
urban
legends
spread
in
the
modern
age
using
the
internet
as
a
new
medium
for
word
of

The
legend
in
the
movie
was
designed
to
feel
like
an

tied
to
the
town
of
Burkittsville
formerly
called
Blair


The
legend
spans
centuries
beginning
with
the
story
of
Elly
Kedward
a
woman
accused
of
witchcraft
to
vanish
and
the
remaining
villagers
abandoned
Blair
convinced
that
the
area
was
cursed

The
legend
suggests
that
Kedward
s
spirit
known
as
the
Blair
Witch
haunted
the
woods
around
Burkittsville
causing
mysterious
disappearances
and
deaths
over
the
years

The
legend
goes
further
citing
the
abduction
of
a
group
of
children
in
the
s
by
a
this
fake
documentary
style
movie
and
it
even
fooled
some
audiences
into
believing
that
the
legend
really
existed

Finally
the
horror
film
Urban

illustrates
exactly
why
urban
legends
are
excellent
fodder
for
a
scary
movie

Set
on
a
college
kidney
heist
organ
theft
and
more

The
film
helps
perpetuate
these
urban
legend
fears
and
that
of
course
makes
it
easier
to
build
a
franchise
of
sequels
But
one
thing
is
made
clear
urban
legends
will
legend
has
it
that
British
born
St

Patrick
used
a
shamrock
to
teach
Irish
pagans
about
the
trinity

However
there
s
a
few
problems
with
The
word
shamrock
doesn
t
come
into
use
until
a
thousand
years
after
St

Patrick
s
death
and
it
took
nearly
as
long
for
this
legend
to
develop

again
he
never
wrote
anything
about
chasing
killing
or
even
screaming
and
running
away
from
snakes

Nobody
mentions
this
legend
until
years
after
the
approximate
date
of
his
death
