Urban
legend
Urban
legends
sometimes
modern
legend
urban
myth
or
simply
legend
is
a
genre
of
folklore
concerning
stories
about
an
unusual
usually
These
legends
can
be
entertaining
but
often
concern
mysterious
peril
or
troubling
events
such
as
disappearances
and
strange
objects
or
entities

Urban
legends
may
confirm
moral
standards
reflect
prejudices
or
be
a
way
to
make
sense
of
societal
anxieties

In
the
past
urban
legends
were
most
often
circulated
orally
at
gatherings
and
around
the
campfire
for
instance

Now
they
can
be
spread
by
any
media
including
newspapers
mobile
news
apps
e
mail
and
most
often
social
media

Some
urban
legends
have
passed
through
the
years
decades
with
only
minor
changes
in
where
the
time
period
takes
place

Generic
urban
legends
are
often
altered
to
suit
regional
variations
but
the
lesson
or
moral
generally
remains
the
same

The
term
urban
legend
as
used
by
folklorists
has
appeared
in
print
since
at
least
when
it
was
used
by
Richard
Dorson

Jan
Harold
the
term
to
the
general
public
in
a
series
of
popular
books
published
beginning
in


Brunvand
used
his
collection
of
legends
The
Vanishing
Hitchhiker
American
Urban
Legends
Their
Meanings
to
make
two
points
first
that
legends
and
folklore
do
not
occur
exclusively
in
so
called
primitive
or
traditional
societies
and
Many
urban
legends
are
framed
as
complete
stories
with
plot
and
characters

The
compelling
appeal
of
a
typical
urban
legend
is
its
elements
of
mystery
horror
fear
or
humor

Often
they
serve
as
cautionary
tales

Some
urban
legends
are
morality
tales
that
depict
someone
acting
in
a
disagreeable
manner
only
to
wind
up
in
trouble
Urban
legends
will
often
try
to
invoke
a
feeling
of
disgust
in
the
reader
which
tends
to
make
these
stories
more
memorable
and
potent

Elements
of
shock
value
can
be
found
in
almost
every
form
of
urban
legend
and
are
partially
what
makes
these
tales
so
impactful

An
urban
legend
may
include
elements
of
the
supernatural
or
paranormal

As
Jan
Brunvand
points
out
antecedent
legends
including
some
of
the
motifs
themes
and
symbolism
of
the
urtexts
can
readily
be
possible
origin
of
The
Hook
in
the
series
of
Lovers
Lane
murders
in
Texarkana
Texas
United
States

The
urban
legend
that
Coca
Cola
developed
the
drink
Fanta
to
sell
in
Nazi
Germany
The
narrator
of
an
urban
legend
may
claim
it
happened
to
a
friend
or
to
a
friend
of
a
friend
which
serves
to
personalize
authenticate
and
enhance
the
power
of
the
narrative
while
distancing
the
teller
from
the
tall
tale

Many
urban
legends
depict
horrific
crimes
contaminated
foods
or
other
situations
that
would
potentially
affect
new
gang
member
would
have
to
murder
the
citizen
as
a
requirement
of
initiation

A
fax
retelling
this
legend
received
at
the
Nassau
County
Florida
fire
department
was
forwarded
to
police
and
from
Urban
legends
typically
include
common
elements
the
tale
is
retold
on
behalf
of
the
original
witness
or
participant
dire
warnings
are
often
identified
by
first
name
only
or
not
identified
at
all

Such
legends
seem
to
be
believable
and
even
provocative
as
some
readers
are
led
in
turn
to
pass
them
on
including
on
social
media
platforms
that
Persistent
urban
legends
do
often
maintain
a
degree
of
plausibility
as
in
the
story
a
serial
killer
deliberately
hiding
in
the
back
seat
of
a
because
of
details
within
its
th
century
trademark

The
legend
interrupted
the
company
s
business
to
the
point
that
it
stopped
using
the
trademark

at
authentication

The
coinage
leads
in
turn
to
the
terms
FOAFlore
and
FOAFtale


While
at
least
one
classic
legend
the
Death
Car
has
been
shown
to
have
some
basis
in
fact
Social
scientists
have
started
to
draw
on
urban
legends
in
order
to
help
explain
complex
socio
psychological
beliefs
such
as
attitudes
to
crime
childcare
fast
food
SUVs
and
other
family
choices

The
authors
make
an
explicit
connection
between
urban
legends
and
popular
folklore
such
as
Grimm
s
Fairy
Tales
where
similar
themes
and
motifs
The
Internet
has
made
it
easier
both
to
spread
and
to
debunk
urban
legends

For
instance
the
Usenet
newsgroup
alt
folklore
urban
and
several
other
websites
most
notably
snopes
com
focus
on
discussing
tracking
and
analyzing
urban
legends

The
United
States
Department
of
Energy
had
a
now
discontinued
service
called
Hoaxbusters
that
dealt
with
computer
distributed
hoaxes
and
legends

The
most
notable
such
hoaxes
are
known
as
creepypastas
which
are
typically
horror
stories
written
anonymously

Although
most
Television
shows
such
as

or

and
later
Mostly

Urban

feature
re

of
urban

detailing
the
accounts
of
the
tales
and
typically
later
in
an
episode
revealing
any
factual
basis
they
may
have

The
Discovery
Channel
TV
show
MythBusters
tried
to
prove
or
disprove
several
urban
legends
by
attempting
to
reproduce
them
using
the
scientific
method

The
film
Urban

featured
students
discussing
popular
urban
legends
while
at
the
same
time
falling
victim
to
killings
re
enacting
them

The
film
The
Blair

Project
purposefully
positioned
itself
as
an
urban

to
gain
viral
hype
and
succeeded
in

many
that

We
all
know
that
the
Slender
Man
is
nothing
more
than
a
pure
urban
legend
created
online
in
on
an
Internet
forum

However
since
then
it
has
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own
even
being
connected
with
physical
sense
the
belief
in
him
by
some
has
made
the
consequences

the
legend
very

the
origins
of
the
Slender
Man
can
be
traced
to
the
exact
date
of
its
creation

At

on

people
became
aware
of
Slender
Man
and
added
their
own
details
and
little
pieces
of
the
backstory
the

In
fact
this
creation
of
a
legend
by
the
audience
themselves
is
the
subject
of
our
next
point

Many
who
study
legends
folklore
and
mythology
have
looked
at
the
Slender
Man
legends
as
a
way
of
being
able
to
document
its
growth
and
reach

And
in
doing
so
they
look
to
understand
how
legends
of
the
past
might
have
developed
and
grown
in
a
similar
way

For
example
there
is
a
collective
element
to
the
growth
of
the
Slender
Man
legend
as
we
examined
above

What
s
more
slight
details
change
depending
on
who
is
accounts
that
were
retold
of
the
Slender
Man
online
as
opposed
to
orally
in
this
case
the
more
the
legend
and
the
backstory
grew

The
Slender
Man
legend
had
very
quickly
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own
much
like
myths
and
folklore
of
the
past

However
several
years
after
On
May
the
Slender
Man
or
at
least
the
consequences
of
the
legend
spilled
over
into
the
real
world
in
a
very
dramatic
way

On
the
morning
in
question
two
year
old
girls
Anissa
Weier
and
Morgan
Following
the
attempted
murder
of
Payton
Leutner
several
copycat
cases
occurred
all
with
various
connections
to
the
Slender
Man
legends

For
example
only
weeks
later
in
June
in
Hamilton
County
Ohio
a
killer
and
his
wife
was
connected
to
the
Slender
Man
after
neighbors
told
the
media
that
he
would
often
dress
up
as
the
Internet
legend
and
parade
around
his
house
and
yard

What
is
further
interesting
about
the
alleged
connections
to
the
Slender
Man
legends
and
these
tragic
deaths
are
legends
of
the
reservation
itself

They
speak
of
a
spirit
named
the
Tall
Man
or
visit
to
take
their
own
lives

It
is
perhaps
a
coincidence
that
there
are
similarities
between
the
legends
of
the
Slender
Man
and
these
Native
American
legends

However
the
coming
together
of
them
within
this
reservation
s
community
very
well
might
have
resulted
in
tragic
Aborted
Mass
Suicide
and
Connections
to
Native
American
Legends
publicity
that
the
Slender
Man
was
receiving
at
this
stage
it
is
perhaps
easy
to
understand
how
some
in
the
media
connected
the
legend
of
the
suicide
spirit
and
this
new
urban
legend

this
point
that
Lacy
shut
the
laptop
down
and
ceased
her
research
into
the
Slender
Man
legends

at
best
were
hallucinations
brought
on
by
her
intense
interest
in
and
subconscious
fear
of
the
Slender
Man
legends

It
is
interesting
to
note
once
more
though
that
the
fine
line
in
a
person
believing
in
a
legend
suddenly
making
it
real
is
indeed
delicate
in
the
extreme

is
they
know

And
although
they
understand
at
least
for
the
most
part
that
he
is
nothing
more
than
an
urban
legend
he
is
without
a
doubt
in
their
collective
subconscious

Of
course
where
the
legend
of
the
Slender
Man
goes
from
here
remains
to
be
seen

Perhaps
he
will
still
be
spoken
in
hundreds
of
years
by
and

Source
It
is
wholly
possible
that
you
have
come
across
an
adaptation
of
Arthurian
legend
at
some
point
in
your
life

After
all
there
have
been
so
many
interpretations
across
varying
genres
and
media
that
an
entire
been
deemed
the
most
extensive
and
culturally
important
work
based
on
Arthurian
legends

This
is
because
it
goes
in
depth
into
the
histories
of
many
characters
notably
the
more
prominent
Knights
of
the
Round
Table
and
Arthur
himself

Le
Morte
d
Arthur
has
inspired
other
great
works
such
as
T
H

White
s
The
Once
and
Future
King

Arthurian
legends
have
also
been
often
referenced
in
parodies
such
as
Monty
Python
and
the
third
Shrek
movie

With
all
these
different
retellings
of
Arthurian
legend
it
becomes
clear
that
they
are
widely
celebrated
even
within
pop
culture

That
leads
us
to
the
question
why
are
Arthurian
legends
so
popular
in
the
first
place
The
general
storyline
of
Arthurian
legends
goes
something
like
this
Arthur
guided
by
the
eccentric
wizard
Merlin
obtains
the
legendary
It
is
likely
that
Arthurian
legends
are
popular
due
to
its
character
archetypes
and
storytelling

Arthurian
legends
feature
characters
that
possess
distinct
personalities
or
capabilities
yet
still
leave
a
lot
of
characters

For
instance
BBC
s
Merlin
series
and
French
drama
Lancelot
du
Lac

Many
characters
in
Arthurian
legends
represent
beloved
archetypes
commonly
found
in
literature

As
an
example
King
Arthur
life
and
manages
to
ensure
peace
while
he
remains
King

Archetypes
can
also
be
easily
assigned
to
other
characters
in
Arthurian
legend

An
example
would
be
Merlin
who
falls
under
the
Mentor
archetype

Equipped
not
exceptional
to
discover
that
numerous
characters
and
plots
resemble
or
overlap
with
that
of
Arthurian
legends
which
have
served
as
models
or
inspiration
for
later
works

Furthermore
Arthurian
legends
may
be
well
received
due
to
the
mystery
involved

There
is
no
definite
storyline
as
Arthurian
legends
are
pieced
together
from
a
number
of
different
sources

There
is
no
is
shown
as
a
benevolent
healer
who
laid
Arthur
to
rest
at
Avalon

As
Arthurian
legends
are
known
to
end
on
a
cliffhanger
hence
Arthur
is
known
as
the
Once
and
Future
King
it
is
generally
agreed
upon
that
temptations
of
filling
in
plot
holes
or
exploring
different
parts
of
Arthurian
legends
may
prove
to
be
too
alluring
to
withstand
for
storytellers

Apart
from
fiction
it
is
perhaps
because
we
know
so
much
yet
so
little
of
Arthurian
legends
that
academic
research
on
the
very
subject
is
still
carried
out
today

As
curator
Dr
ap
Huw
mentions
the
Sure
Arthurian
legends
may
be
popular
but
at
the
possible
expense
of
angering
Arthurian
scholars
and
fans
are
the
legends
actually
important
The
answer
to
this
is
subjective
and
depends
on
the
audience
s
opinions

Still
it
cannot
be
denied
that
the
legends
are
classics
that
illustrate
an
important
piece
of
history
no
matter
snapshot
of
how
and
what
people
s
beliefs
were
like
at
the
time

Arthurian
legends
have
also
been
proved
to
withstand
the
test
of
time
from
mediaeval
to
the
modern
era

As
mentioned
they
have
been
revamped
considerable
significance
and
its
enduring
popularity
demonstrates
that
the
legends
are
still
fully
capable
of
attracting
a
sizable
audience
old
young
and
anywhere
in
between

The
many
adaptations
of
Arthurian
legends
in
the
fantasy
genre
like
C
S

Lewis
The
Chronicles
of
Narnia
and
even
George
Lucas
Star
Wars
undoubtedly
attest
to
the
legends
influence

Not
only
have
they
been
featured
heavily
in
fiction
and
to
uncovering
the
real
life
counterparts
of
the
settings
in
which
Arthurian
legends
take
place

In
particular
it
has
been
widely
hypothesised
that
Avalon
could
in
actuality
be
Glastonbury
or
Isle
of
for
a
sense
of
dignity
and
justice
that
seem
to
only
exist
in
myth

The
diverse
interpretations
of
Arthurian
legends
also
bring
to
light
different
aspects
of
the
tale
such
as
the
contrasting
portrayals
of
storyteller
s
perspectives

What
do
you
think
of
when
it
comes
to
Arthurian
legends
Is
it
the
memorable
characters
the
beautiful
settings
or
the
weighty
symbolism
Do
you
have
any
theories
of
when
King
Arthur
will
rise
again
Arthurian
legends
can
mean
many
things
to
many
different
people

They
evolve
according
to
its
audience
and
their
expectations
as
well
as
understanding
of
the
stories

Even
so
it
is
evident
that
Arthurian
legends
remain
compelling
in
the
minds
of
the
people

As
the
BBC
reports
Romantics
may
hope
that
one
day
Arthur
will
return
to
rescue
his
people

But
if
he
lives
on
through
his
legend
the
ancient
monarch
it
would
appear
has
never
really
gone
away

MASTER

The
article
The
Legend
of
Master
Legend
written
by
Joshuah
Bearman
and
appearing
in
the
January
edition
of
Rolling
Stone
was
my
and
very
different
e
mails

One
was
from
someone
telling
me
what
a
great
awesome
guy
Master
Legend
was
and
that
I
should
get
in
contact
with
him

A
second
e
mail
told
me
that
Master
Legend
was
a
nutjob
and
they
were
sick
of
writers
using
him
as
a
representative
of
the
RLSH
repeatedly
during
my
course
of
writing
about
RLSH

PRO
LEGEND
Tales
of
Comic
Book
Bravado
and
Crimefighting
Something
that
appeals
to
some
RLSH
about
Master
Legend
is
that
he
is
very
dynamic
and
energetic

He
is
often
documented
running
jumping
wild
action
packed
and
never
a
snoozefest

Some
of
them
are
fantastic
and
we
must
take
them
at
Master
Legend
s
word
since
the
only
witnesses
are
Master
Legend
himself
and
the
claimed
league
of
frightened
criminals
who
have
had
the
misfortune
of
it

This
guy
known
as
Big
Red
has
been
terrorizing
my
homeless
friends
but
now
it
s
time
to
meet
the
Legend

This
guy
has
tried
to
evade
me
because
he
knows
of
the
whispered
tales
behind
shuttered
doors
of
Master
Legend

He
has
a
few
punks
that
do
crack
friends
so
I
got
Brimstone
to
come
along
for
been
running
his
mouth
out
in
the
streets
saying
he
can
kick
Master
Legend
s
ass

I
tell

scares

then

Big

if
you

Master

s
energy
and
his
war
stories
are
contagious
and
has
won
him
RLSH
and
non
RLSH
fans
alike

Acting
as
a
Media
Ambassador
Besides
the
Rolling
Stone
article
mentioned
Master
Legend
has
attracted
media
attention
from
around
the
world
and
for
many
some
kind
and
strangely
has
even
had
talks
about
his
own
cooking
show
Some
RLSH
say
this
media
attention
is
not
just
good
for
Master
Legend
but
good
for
RLSH
in
general

Not
only
that
but
Master
Legend
runs
his
own
RLSH
forum
leading
a
platoon
at
the
Master
Legend
Army
and
recently
began
his
own
internet
radio

One
of
America
s
great
exports
besides

is
rock

and
Master
Legend
likes
to
shred
on
the
guitar
as
evidenced
by
video
showing
him
performing
with
the
band
Alias
Punch
as
well
as
his

projects

spoke
favorably
of

The
Sergeant
who
s
in

of
vice
investigations
took
a
chance
and
tracked
Master
Legend
down

Based
on
the
neighborhood
he
figured
Master
Legend
might
be
a
good
local
contact

And
sure
enough
the
Sergeant
tells
me
I
start
getting
calls
from
Master
Legend
with
information

And
it
checks
out

The
very
thing
that
appeals
to
some
people
about

is
what
others
use
as
a
criticism
his

of

In
another

Master

himself
describes

confrontation
he
has
in
an
alleyway
with
three
criminals
he
encounters
while
give
a
then
take
off
my
helmet
and
bash
him
in
the
head
with
it
by
this
time
they
hear
the
Legend
yell
as
I
go
into
Fist

mode

The
one
guy
s
head
is
bleeding
and
he
staggers
off
as
the
other
two
are
He
goes
on
to
say
that
he
flees
the
scene
when
someone
comes
across
it
and
says
they
are
calling
the
cops

Master
Legend
says
call
them
and
gives
the
person
his
card
before
heading
to
a
pizza
joint
and
ordering
up
the
good
work

So
Master
Legend
triumphs
over
three
armed
street
hoods
using
his
WWII
helmet
and
habanero
pepper
he
has
tucked
in
his
utility

Claims
of
Metaphysical
and
Religious
Powers
Master

has
claimed
to
have
various
metaphysical
and
voodoo
based
powers

In

Master
Legend
posted
a
message
that
he
was
the
archangel
Metatron

It
first
appeared
at
the
Heroes
Network
which
led
Anti

Comments
Master
Legend
has
received
some
controversy
from
statements
he
s
made
regarding
homosexuals

For
instance
on
March
Atavistik
a
RLSH
California
meet
up
for
San
Francisco
s
Gay
Pride
Fest

Master

responded
to

In
this

Godiva
by
John
Collier
the
authentic
historical
person
is
fully
submerged
in
the
legend
presented
in
an
anachronistic
high
medieval
setting

A
legend
is
a
genre
of
folklore
that
consists
of
a
narrative
featuring
human
actions
believed
or
perceived
to
have
taken
place
in
human
history

Narratives
in
this
genre
may
demonstrate
human
values
and
possess
certain
qualities
that
give
the
tale
verisimilitude

Legend
for
its
active
and
passive
participants
may
include
miracles

Legends
may
be
transformed
over
time
to
keep
them
fresh
and
vital

Many
legends
operate
within
the
realm
of
uncertainty
never
being
entirely
believed
by
the
participants
but
also
never
being
resolutely
doubted

Legends
are
sometimes
distinguished
from
myths
in
that
they
concern
human
beings
as
the
main
characters
and
do
not
necessarily
historical
basis
whereas
myths
generally
do
not

The
Brothers
Grimm
defined
legend
as
folktale
historically
grounded


A
by
product
of
the
concern
with
human
beings
is
the
long
list
of
legendary
creatures
leaving
no
resolute
doubt
that
legends
are
historically
grounded

A
modern
folklorist
s
professional
definition
of
legend
was
proposed
by
Timothy
R

Tangherlini
in
Legend
typically
is
a
short
mono
episodic
traditional
highly
ecotypified
historicized
narrative
performed
in
a
conversational
Legend
is
a
loanword
from
Old
French
that
entered
English
usage
c



The
Old
French
noun
legende
derives
from
the
Medieval
Latin
introduced
in
the
s
meaning
a
collection
or
corpus
of
legends

This
word
changed
to
legendry
and
legendary
became
the
adjectival
form

acknowledged
in
John
Foxe
s
Actes
and
Monuments
was
fictitious

Thus
legend
gained
its
modern
connotations
of
undocumented
and
spurious
which
distinguish
it
from
the
meaning
of
chronicle

In
Jacob
Grimm
described
the
fairy
tale
as
poetic

Questions
of
categorising
legends
in
hopes
of
compiling
a
content
based
series
of
categories
on
the
line
of
the
Aarne
Thompson
folktale
index
provoked
a
search
for
a
questions
operative
in
examining
folk
tales
Friedrich
Ranke
de
in
characterised
the
folk
legend
as
a
popular
narrative
with
an
objectively
untrue
imaginary
content
a
dismissive
position
that
was
Compared
to
the
highly
structured
folktale
legend
is
comparatively
amorphous
Helmut
de
Boor
noted
in


The
narrative
content
of
legend
is
in
realistic
mode
rather
than
the
wry
irony
of
folktale
Wilhelm
Heiske
remarked
on
the
similarity
of
motifs
in
legend
and
folktale
and
concluded
that
in
spite
of
its
realistic
mode
legend
is
not
more
historical
than
folktale

In
Einleitung
in
der
Geschichtswissenschaft
Ernst
Bernheim
asserted
that
a
legend
is
simply
a
longstanding
rumour

Gordon
Allport
credited
the
staying
power
of
some
rumours
to
the
persistent
cultural
state
of
mind
that
they
embody
and
capsulise
thus
Urban
legends
are
a
feature
of
rumour

When
Willian
Hugh
Jansen
suggested
that
legends
that
disappear
quickly
were
short
term
legends
and
the
persistent
ones
be
termed
long
term
legends
the
distinction
between
legend
and
rumour
was
effectively
obliterated
Tangherlini
concluded

legendary

Because
saints
lives
are
often
included
in
many
miracle
stories
legend
in
a
wider
sense
came
to
refer
to
any

that

a
few
categories
and
can
t
go
about
expanding
the

size

The
other
obvious
way
around
it
is
placing
the
legend
to
the
left
or
right
though
I
need
it
at
the
bottom
center

In
Excel
for
example
the
legend
can
be
fit
in
two
three
parallel

Don

see
that
happening
here

There
is
no
such
option
for

now


I
suggest
you
create
an
idea
for
it
in
As
a
workaround
you

The
legend
module
defines
the
Legend
class
which
is
responsible
for
drawing
legends
associated
with
Axes
and
or
figures

It
is
unlikely
that
you
would
ever
create
a
Legend
instance
manually

Most
users
would
normally
create
a
legend
via
the
legend
function

For
more
details
on
legends
there
is
also
a
legend
guide

The
Legend
class
is
a
container
of
legend
handles
and
legend
texts

The
legend
handler
map
specifies
how
to
create
legend
handles
from
artists
lines
patches
etc

in
the
Axes
or
figures

Default
legend
handlers
are
defined
in
the
legend
handler
module

While
not
all
artist
types
are
covered
by
the
default
legend
handlers
custom
legend

can
be
defined
to

this
is
played
out
through

A

the

from

Legend

had
to
go
through
a
significant
transformation
and
although
there
are
many
familiar
elements
within
the
game
the
gameplay
itself
is
very
different

Because
of
this

faceless

in
the
dark
the
story
of
a
man
waking
up
with
a
missing
kidney
urban
legends
have
always
been
whispered
to
us

From
a
young
age
we
have
been
told
stories
babysitter
and
hundreds
of
other
stories
that
make
our
skin
crawl

Urban
legends
surround
us
and
they
can
be
anything
from
tales
told
on
the
school
bus
to
internet
stories

But
why
much
The
term
urban
legend
has
been
popular
since
the
s
when
Jan
Harold
Brunvand
published
his
collection
of
urban
legends
and
their
meanings

When
discussing
the
story
of
the
vanishing
hitchhiker
Harold
wrote
that
the
legend
had
evolved
from
older
European
stories
about
travelers
riding
horseback

With
and
wide
spreading
by
word
of
mouth
to
ears
all
around

Urban
legends
typically
grow
popular
through
storytelling

The
speaker
usually
claims
that
such
things
happened
to
a
friend
Because
why
would
a
friend
lie
The
peculiarities
and
suspense
of
an
urban
legend
are
what
makes
them
spread

The
more
shocking
yet
realistic
the
story
the
more
we
want
to
share
it

Sometimes
urban
legends
are
told
to
extend
caution
and
sometimes
most
times
they
are
simply
good
stories

Nowadays
instant
communication
has
made
it
easier
for
urban
legends
to
spread

For
a
long
time
urban
legend
email
chains
were
popular
and
now
such
tales
are
told
on
social
media
with
a
their
feeds

What
makes
urban
legends
so
captivating
is
that
they
contain
elements
from
everyday
life
such
as
walking
through
the
possibility
that
ordinary
things
could
expose
us
to
the
terrors
these
legends
speak
of

As
time
passes
urban
legends
shift
retelling
a
modernized
version
of
the
story
to
newer
audiences
making
urban
legends
everlasting

Some
stories
we
take
more
seriously
than
others
because
apart
from
entertainment
urban
legends
allow
us
to
spread
awareness
and
preach
caution
about
the
dangers
hidden
in
everyday
life

But
there
have
been
times
when
urban
legends
have
been
taken
too
seriously

In
two
girls
attempted
to
brutally
murder
their
best
friend
because
of
the
urban
legend
of
the
Slender
Man

The
first
time
the
name
touched
screens
was
in
when
two
It
is
important
to
be
cautious
when
spreading
stories
especially
among
children

Because
urban
legends
like
this
one
can
quickly
unfold
into
more
elaborate
creative
stories
our

The
same
is
true
of
other
genres
of
folklore
whether
we
are
talking
of
riddles
proverbs
legends
or
folksongs
it
is
difficult
to
find
examples
limited
to
just
one
region
or
one
nation

They
all
have
However
it
was
not
to
history
that
each
group
appealed
during
their
confrontation
but
to
legend
in
particular
to
divergent
legends
of
Gargantua

The
story
also
alludes
to
several
other
religious
comic
and
aetiological
legends
which
would
help
listeners
make
sense
of
their
local
geography

Nineteenth
century
folklorists
were
more
interested
in
stories
were
being
told
at
particular
moments

But
in
Le
H
riss
s
tale
it
is
clear
that
legends
were
not
just
amusing
pastimes
they
had
a
function
it
is
this
functional
aspect
that
provides
the
link
between
a
particular
landscape
and
the
stories
told
within
it

Legends
were
mobilized
as
charters
of
ownership
by
the
communities
that
told
them

There
is
a
whole
cycle
of
Gargantua
legends
concerning
this
coastline
often
associated
with
particular
features
such
as
Gargantua
s
tooth
near
Saint
Suliac
or
his
finger
at
Fort
La
Latte
both
prehistoric
standing
stones


S
billot
collected
several
Gargantua
legends
in
Saint
Cast

They
did
not
concur
in
every
detail
but
it
is
C
tins
and
Jaguens
told
two
contradictory
legends
about
Gargantua
and
the
Bourdineaux
but
to
what
extent
were
either
believed
Belief
used
to
be
the
test
that
folklorists
applied
to
distinguish
a
folktale
from
a
legend
the
former
being
told
as
a
fiction
and
the
latter
as
a
true
account

However
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
anyone
could
figure
of
Jesus

This
may
be
a
deliberately
ironic
counter
comment
to
the
common
legend
of
Breton
piety
in
which
a
peasant
refuses
to
strike
a
crucifix
despite
threats
from
Republican
troops
and
dies
a
martyr
s
H
riss
s
audience
could
orientate
themselves
in
the
landscape
aetiological
legends
like
that
of
Gargantua
s
finger
and
lieux
dits
such
as
the
Becrond
contained
descriptions
of
landmarks
which
together
formed
a
working
map
of
the
area

Legends
were
an
informal
education
in
significant
geography
one
learnt
the
boundaries
of
one
s
community
with
one
s
neighbours
and
just
as
importantly
with
the
supernatural

Legends
connected
the
vital
history
of
the
community
to
its

No

could

that

would
be
beaten
at
each
boundary
marker
to
help
them
more
vividly
their

location

Legends
served

if
less
painful
function

They
were
the
collective
memory
of
the
community

In
nearly
every
The
Legend
of
Zelda
video
game
we
explore
a
vast
landscape
usually
called
Hyrule
and
yet
no
two
Hyrules
are
ever
documentation
of
this
magical
land

In
the
instruction
manual
for
The
Legend
of
Zelda
it
indicates
that
this
game
takes
place
in
a
little
kingdom
in
the
land
of
Hyrule

As
we
discover
in
the
direct
sequel
the
vast
landscape
we
traversed
in
the
first
game

Clearly
we
are
to
believe
that
Hyrule
as
we
knew
it
in
The
Legend
of
Zelda
is
but
one
tiny
piece
of
a
grand
land

actually
takes
place
within
the
same
vague
area
of
Hyrule
seen
in
The
Legend
of
Zelda

In
each
Zelda
video
game
we
are
provided
with
two
important
documents
a
legend
regarding
the
history
preceding
the
story
of
the
game
usually
entitled
Story
and
a
rough
map
of
the
geography
that
Link
will
Take
for
instance
the
original
The
Legend
of
Zelda
in
the
instruction
manual
we
are
presented
with
a
highly
detailed
clay
The
Legend
of
Zelda
s
Hyrule
Are
we
then
to
believe
that
The
Legend
of
Zelda
s
blocky
clay
map
of
Hyrule
is
more
accurate
than
Ocarina
s
merely
because
it
better
matches
exist
as
a
landscape

We
must
then
assume
that
Hyrule
as
depicted
in
The
Legend
of
Zelda
is
an
impression
only

If
we
take
both
the
instruction
manual
map
and
in
game
landscape
as
impressionistic
for
The
Legend
of
Zelda
why
then
should
we
take
any
other
representation
of
Hyrule
any
more
literally
The
majority
of
the

games
take
place
in
the

pioneered
a
number
of
features
that
were

standards

The

was
the
first
console
game
with
a

function
that
enabled
players
to
stop
playing
and
then

of

Ocarina

introduced
a
targeting
system
that
let
the
player
lock
the
camera
on
to
enemy
or

The
Legend
of
Zelda
was
principally
inspired
by
Shigeru
Miyamoto
s
explorations
as
a
young
boy
in
the
hillsides
forests
and
caves
the
first
game
s
manual
the
location
named
Death
Mountain
was
initially
a
working
title
for
the
legend
of
the
Triforce
which
was
written
with
inspirations
from
the
battles
of
medieval
Europe

Link
to
the
Past
which
is
regarded
as
reminiscent
to
the
legend
of
King
Arthur

Celtic
mythology
inspired
the
name
of
Link
s
steed
Epona
based
on
Epona
Celtic
goddess
of
Paying
tribute
he
chose
to
name
the
princess
after
her
and
titled
it
The

and

were

by
Peter

When

the
Games
in

frequently
feature
in

musical
instruments

in

puzzles
which
are

Often
instruments
trigger

events

the

can
reveal
secret

as

as

Explain
the
Legend
of
Zelda
to
me
Absolute
Beginner
I
have
no
idea
what
the
Legend
of
Zelda
is
other
than
the
character
Link
I
recently
got
a
switch
and
I
m
thinking
about
buying
Breath
if
Arqade
Feed
for
question
What
is
Zelda
s
Legend
What
is
Zelda
s
Legend
Basically
through
the
long
and
short
of
it
the
primary
focus
of
every
game
is
on
Link
so
the
title
does
seem
a
little
off
but
Legend
of
Link
doesn
t
quite
have
the
same
ring
to
it
not
to
mention
the
Link
and
even
Ganon
or
Ganondorf
so
does
the
title
link
itself
to
more
than
just
a
character
What
is
Zelda
s
Legend
Pun
intended
legend
of
zelda
series
League
of
Legends
seems
to
handle
the
LoL
problem

jpmc
Zelda
may
have
had
a
lot
of
legends
but
Link
got
an
adventure

Jason
C
The
first
The
Legend
of
Zelda
game
was
focused
on
rescuing
Zelda
from
the
clutches
of
Gannon
as
his
name
was
originally
spelt

The
decision
In
the
immediate
sequel
they
dropped
The
Legend
and
opted
for
Zelda
II
The
Adventure
of
Link

This
sequel
wasn
t
as
well
received
so
as
As
for
what
The
Legend
is
you
have
to
look
at
the
first
game
in
the
timeline
The
Legend
of
Zelda
Skyward
Sword

In
that
game
this
Zelda
is
not
a
princess
but
the
first
human
mortal
reincarnation
of
the
goddess
Hylia

This
is
further
explained
at
the
back
of
the
Hyrule
Historia
book
in
a
translated
manga
titled
The
Legend
is
Born
a
page
of
which
I
have
taken
a
photo
of

I
think
it
s
fair
to
say
that
at
the
time
of
release
of
the
first
game
the
legend
simply
was
the
story
of
the
game

Tons
of
games
were
called
legend
of
something
at
the
time
and
those
were
always
games
where
the
story
was
the
legend
the
title
referred
to

Zelda
was
no
exception

Commented
Apr
at
Kevin




and
then
it
became
a
loooong
legend

Or
collection
or
legends

Maybe
the
name
should
be
changed
to
The
Saga
of
Zelda
xDaizu
There
really
is
an
in
universe
Legend
of
Zelda
mentioned
in
the
instruction
manual
of
Zelda
II
as
told
by
Impa
Link
the
time
has
come
when
I
must
tell
you
the
legend
of
Zelda
handed
down
in
Hyrule

It
is
said
that
long
ago
when
Hyrule
was
one
The
Legend
of
Zelda
Many
years
ago
Prince
Darkness
Gannon
stole
one
of
the
Triforce
with
Power

Princess
Zelda
had
one
of
the
Triforce
with
name
of
the
game
but
I
always
thought
of
this
text
as
the
simplified
summarized
version
of
the
legend

middle
of
this
chaos
in
a
little
kingdom
in
the
land
of
Hyrule
a
legend
was
being
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
the
legend
of
the
Triforce
golden
triangles
possessing
mystical
powers

an
entire
suite

to

The
legend

the
story
of
Ocarina

the

Ganon

presence

In

Celtic
influence
coupled
with
its
cartoonish
art

creates
an
atmosphere

a
real
treat
for
gamers
for
both
hardcore
and
casual

fans

A
break
in
the
traditional
mold
established
but
with
the
added
twist
of
unique
artistic
style
and
a
foundation
built
on
an
ancient
culture
deeply
invested
in
its
legends
and
spirituality

The
game
presents
a
story
that
is
both
fun
and
heart
warming
light
and
dark
proving
that
legends
and
fantastic
tales
are
not

what

These

Despite
its

a
typical
urban
legend
does
not
necessarily
originate
in
an
urban
setting

The
term
is
simply
used
to
differentiate
modern
legend
from
traditional
folklore
in
preindustrial
times

For
this
reason
sociologists
and
folklorists
prefer
the
term
contemporary
legend

Urban

are

This
concept
of

is
linked
to
several
urban
legends
but
one
of
the
most
prominent
is
the
Japanese
kuchisake
onna
Slit
Mouthed
Woman
legend
where
a
vengeful
female
spirit
appears
with
a
disfigured
face
and
asks
potential
victims
if
they
find
her
beautiful

Depending
on
their
answer
she
either
kills
them
or
harms
them

The

plays
on
the
broader
concept

This
movie
wasn
t
based
on
an
urban
legend
per
se
but
it
used
the
idea
of
urban
legends
and
folklore
to
scare
viewers

Also
The
filmmakers
created
and
disseminated
a
fictional
urban
legend
of
their
own
to
promote
the
film
of
course

Early
internet
culture
helped
to
make
their
fictional
legend
seem
real
the
filmmakers
created
a
website
that
presented
the
Blair
Witch
story
as
genuine
folklore
complete
with
how
quaint
to
imagine
this
in
modern
day
smartly
mimicked
the
way
urban
legends
spread
in
the
modern
age
using
the
internet
as
a
new
medium
for
word
of
mouth

The
legend
in
the
movie
was
designed
to
feel
like
an
authentic
ancient
myth
and
the
film
cleverly
presents
it
as
Mike
venture
into
the
woods
near
Burkittsville
Maryland
in
to
make
a
documentary
about
the
Blair
Witch
legend

Witch
Project
the
Blair
Witch
is
a
vengeful
spirit
tied
to
the
town
of
Burkittsville
formerly
called
Blair


The
legend
spans
centuries
beginning
with
the
story
of
Elly
Kedward
a
woman
accused
of
witchcraft
to
vanish
and
the
remaining
villagers
abandoned
Blair
convinced
that
the
area
was
cursed

The
legend
suggests
that
Kedward
s
spirit
known
as
the
Blair
Witch
haunted
the
woods
around
Burkittsville
causing
mysterious
disappearances
and
deaths
over
the
years

The
legend
goes
further
citing
the
abduction
of
a
group
of
children
in
the
s
by
a
this
fake
documentary
style
movie
and
it
even
fooled
some
audiences
into
believing
that
the
legend
really
existed

Finally
the
horror
film
Urban
Legend
illustrates
exactly
why
urban
legends
are
excellent
fodder
for
a
scary
movie

Set
on
a
college
campus
a
series
of
gruesome
student
murders
start
happening
and
they
seem
to
reflect
commonly
known
urban
legends

Indeed
the
killer
in
the
film
uses
these
legends
as
inspiration
for
creative
killings
and
the
plot
heavily
relies
on
the
audience
recognizing
these
myths

Among
the
common
urban
legends
depicted
are

killer
hiding

backseat
waiting
to

theft

more

The
film
helps
perpetuate
these
urban
legend
fears
and
that
of
course
makes
it
easier
to
build
a
franchise
of
sequels
But
one
thing
is
