Twenty-five years ago, the <a href="https://www.espn.com/sportscentury/athletes.html">ESPN SportsCentury project</a> ranked the top 100 North American athletes of the 20th century. Michael Jordan came in first, followed by Babe Ruth, Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown and Wayne Gretzky. (Ruth should have been No. 1, but hey, I'm a baseball writer.) We also ranked a horse: Secretariat came in at No. 35.</p><aside class="inline float-r inline-track"><h2 class="img-title">Your League, Your Rules</h2><p><a href="https://fantasy.espn.com/football/welcome?addata=ffl_2024_in_line_bethecommish" target="_blank"><img src="https://g.espncdn.com/lm-static/ffl/images/promo-cards/ffl-1320x528_03.jpg" alt="" width="100%" class="imageLoaded"></a></p><p>Create a league and customize league size, scoring and rules to play in the league <i>you</i> want to play in.</p><p><strong><a href="https://fantasy.espn.com/football/welcome?addata=ffl_2024_in_line_bethecommish">Create a league today!</a></strong></p>
</aside><p>With so many transcendent athletes over the past 25 years, we thought it was time to do another ranking. I promise you there are no horses this time (sorry, American Pharoah). In considering the best athletes of the 21st century, however, we have expanded our choices beyond North America. ESPN editions from around the globe contributed to the nominations and voting process, as well as the individual sport list rankings that will follow.</p><p>Voters were instructed to consider only an athlete's performance since 2000. So, for Barry Bonds: He won seven MVP awards, but only four of those came after 2000, as did 317 of his 762 home runs. Or Ken Griffey Jr.: He played until 2010, but all of his best seasons came in the 1990s. Tiger won 13 of his 15 majors from 2000 on, so he's in good shape.

She was in peak Serena form, never dropping a set en route to a final showdown with her sister Venus. She defeated Venus to take sole ownership of the record.</p><p>Williams played in four more major finals after her return from maternity leave and a complicated childbirth.

The 48-point game was a mesmerizing performance that stands as one of the classic games of this century ... and it probably doesn't even rank in the top 10 of James' playoff performances.

The first and only Black driver to race in F1, Hamilton has described his path to the top as a "lonely journey," but continues to commit his energy, time and money to increasing diversity in his sport. "I'm winning all of these races, but it doesn't actually mean anything unless you do something with the platform it provides you," he said after securing his seventh title in 2020. The next chapter in his remarkable story starts in 2025 when he moves to F1's most famous team, Ferrari. -- <em>Laurence Edmondson</em></p><ul><li><p><strong><a href="/f1/story/_/id/30587297/how-2020-changed-lewis-hamilton">How 2020 changed Lewis Hamilton</a></strong></li></ul><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/i/infographics/20160725_mlbrankfuture/greyline.png" width="100%"><img class="floatleft imageLoaded" height="250px" src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2024/0714/240715_top-100_inlines_020.jpg"><h2>20. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16716/aaron-donald">Aaron Donald</a>, football</h2><p><strong>Key accomplishments:</strong> 10-time Pro Bowler, eight-time first-team All-Pro, three-time Defensive POY (tied for most all time), HOF All-2010s <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8806/team">Team</a>, 2014 Defensive ROY</p><p>Donald went into his eighth NFL season with many significant achievements on the field for the Rams: Defensive Rookie of the Year, three NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards and seven Pro Bowls to start his career.

There's no question McIlroy has been one of the most consistent and popular golfers of his generation. He has won 40 times, including 26 times on the PGA Tour. He is a three-time PGA Tour Player of the Year and a five-time winner of the DP World Tour's Race to Dubai. However, McIlroy's nearly 10-year drought in the four majors since capturing the 2014 PGA Championship leaves him a step below legends such as Tiger Woods, <a data-player-guid="a05dfa7e-bea8-cc6c-f7fb-0e76cb450bde" href="https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/320/jack-nicklaus">Jack Nicklaus</a>, <a data-player-guid="b57c694f-e470-d36e-91ef-11cadeebf7f6" href="https://www.espn.com/golf/player/_/id/334/arnold-palmer">Arnold Palmer</a> and others.

Between 2003 and 2006, there was no better show in soccer. There have been few, if any, more talented players in the history of the global game, and all too briefly Ronaldinho captivated with his childlike glee at his own achievements, reminding so many of why they fell in love with the sport in the first place. A disappointing 2006 World Cup was a turning point, and he appeared to grow weary of the sacrifices needed to stay at the top level.

There has never existed an athlete who was as good as Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá said he was, but the 6-foot-5 striker did as well as anyone could -- and for as long as anyone could -- at approaching that level.

He was on his own island, so to speak, spawning the "Revis Island" moniker. The result was one of the best cornerback seasons in history. Revis held Andre Johnson, Randy Moss (twice) and Terrell Owens (twice) -- all Hall of Famers -- under 35 receiving yards.

McDavid had long been an exceptional playmaker in his own right, but the way he carried the Oilers back from a 3-0 series deficit in the Final to force a decisive Game 7 was spectacular.

"It was a beautiful transition," Woodson said, "if you will." And his first NFL coach, Jon Gruden, most certainly would.

Each voter was presented two randomly selected names and asked to pick which one has had the better career in the 21st century. Across repeated, randomized head-to-head matchups, more than 70,000 votes were cast at this stage, and using an Elo rating system, the list was pared down from 262 to 100. That list was then evaluated by a panel of experts for any inconsistencies or oversights, resulting in the top 100 ranking seen here.</em></p>
