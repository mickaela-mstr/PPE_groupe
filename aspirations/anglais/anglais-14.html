	birth of a legend</h3>
<p>
	When the Romans first came to northern Scotland in the first century A.D., they found the Highlands occupied by fierce, tattoo-covered tribes they called the Picts, or painted people. From the carved, standing stones still found in the region around Loch Ness, it is clear the Picts were fascinated by animals, and careful to render them with great fidelity. All the animals depicted on the Pictish stones are lifelike and easily recognizable‚Äîall but one. The exception is a strange beast with an elongated beak or muzzle, a head locket or spout, and flippers instead of feet. Described by some scholars as a swimming elephant, the Pictish beast is the earliest known evidence for an idea that has held sway in the Scottish Highlands for at least 1,500 years‚Äîthat Loch Ness is home to a mysterious aquatic animal.</p>
<p>
	In Scottish folklore, large animals have been associated with many bodies of water, from small streams to the largest lakes, often labeled Loch-na-Beistie on old maps. These water-horses, or water-kelpies, are said to have magical powers and malevolent intentions. According to one version of the legend, the water-horse lures small children into the water by offering them rides on its back. Once the children are aboard, their hands become stuck to the beast and they are dragged to a watery death, their livers washing ashore the following day.</p>
<p>
	The earliest written reference linking such creatures to Loch Ness is in the biography of Saint Columba, the man credited with introducing Christianity to Scotland. In A.D. 565, according to this account, Columba was on his way to visit a Pictish king when he stopped along the shore of Loch Ness. Seeing a large beast about to attack a man who was swimming in the lake, Columba raised his hand, invoking the name of God and commanding the monster to &quot;go back with all speed.&quot; The beast complied, and the swimmer was saved.</p>

<p>
	When Nicholas Witchell, a future BBC correspondent, researched the history of the legend for his 1974 book <cite>The Loch Ness Story,</cite> he found about a dozen pre-20th-century references to large animals in Loch Ness, gradually shifting in character from these clearly mythical accounts to something more like eyewitness descriptions.</p>
<h3>
	a 20th-century sensation</h3>
<p>
	The modern legend of Loch Ness dates from 1933, when a new road was completed along the shore, offering the first clear views of the loch from the northern side. One April afternoon, a local couple was driving home along this road when they spotted &quot;an enormous animal rolling and plunging on the surface.&quot; Their account was written up by a correspondent for the <cite>Inverness Courier,</cite> whose editor used the word &quot;monster&quot; to describe the animal. The Loch Ness Monster has been a media phenomenon ever since.</p>
<p>
	Public interest built gradually during the spring of 1933, then picked up sharply after a couple reported seeing one of the creatures on land, lumbering across the shore road. By October, several London newspapers had sent correspondents to Scotland, and radio programs were being interrupted to bring listeners the latest news from the loch. A British circus offered a reward of ¬£20,000 for the capture of the beast. Hundreds of boy scouts and outdoorsmen arrived, some venturing out in small boats, others setting up deck chairs and waiting expectantly for the monster to appear.</p>
<p>
	The excitement over the monster reached a fever pitch in December, when the <cite>London Daily Mail</cite> hired an actor, film director, and big-game hunter named Marmaduke Wetherell to track down the beast. After only a few days at the loch, Wetherell reported finding the fresh footprints of a large, four-toed animal. He estimated it to be 20 feet long. With great fanfare, Wetherell made plaster casts of the footprints and, just before Christmas, sent them off to the Natural History Museum in London for analysis. While the world waited for the museum zoologists to return from holiday, legions of monster hunters descended on Loch Ness, filling the local hotels. Inverness was floodlit for the occasion, and traffic jammed the shoreline roads in both directions.</p>

<p></p>
<p>
	The bubble burst in early January, when museum zoologists announced that the footprints were those of a hippopotamus. They had been made with a stuffed hippo foot‚Äîthe base of an umbrella stand or ashtray. It wasn&#x27;t clear whether Wetherell was the perpetrator of the hoax or its gullible victim. Either way, the incident tainted the image of the Loch Ness Monster and discouraged serious investigation of the phenomenon. For the next three decades, most scientists scornfully dismissed reports of strange animals in the loch. Those sightings that weren&#x27;t outright hoaxes, they said, were the result of optical illusions caused by boat wakes, wind slicks, floating logs, otters, ducks, or swimming deer.</p>
<h3>
<b>Saw Something, They Did</b></h3>
<p>
	Nevertheless, eyewitnesses continued to come forward with accounts of their sightings‚Äîmore than 4,000 of them, according to Witchell&#x27;s estimate. Most of the witnesses described a large creature with one or more humps protruding above the surface like the hull of an upturned boat. Others reported seeing a long neck or flippers. What was most remarkable, however, was that many of the eyewitnesses were sober, level-headed people: lawyers and priests, scientists and school teachers, policemen and fishermen‚Äîeven a Nobel Prize winner.</p>
<p>
	In the 1950s, a local doctor named Constance Whyte began collecting these eyewitness accounts, along with sketches of what the people had seen, finally publishing them in 1957 as a book entitled <cite>More Than a Legend.</cite> Noting that many of her friends had been subjected to ridicule and contempt, Whyte said her goal in writing the book was &quot;the vindication of many people of integrity who had reported honestly what they had seen in Loch Ness.&quot; (To hear recent personal anecdotes, see <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/lochness/eyewitness.html">Eyewitness Accounts.</a>)</p>

<figcaption>In the 1960s a group of dedicated amateurs formed the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau to keep a constant vigil on the loch.

<p>
	Whyte&#x27;s book inspired a new generation of monster hunters, including Tim Dinsdale, who on his first visit to the loch in 1960 took an intriguing film of something moving across the loch‚Äîand promptly gave up his career as an aeronautical engineer to devote his life to pursuing the monster. The next year, a group of dedicated amateurs formed the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau, keeping a constant vigil on the loch from an observation post on the northern shore.</p>
<p>
	But perhaps the most important effect of Whyte&#x27;s book was to turn the tide of public opinion. Long dismissed as fodder for &quot;silly season&quot; press reports, Nessie was finally considered a subject worthy of serious scientific investigation. In the span of a decade, beginning in 1958, four separate expeditions were launched, first by the BBC, then by three respected British universities: Oxford, Cambridge, and the University of Birmingham. Rather than scanning the surface with binoculars and cameras, as the amateur investigators had, these expeditions came equipped with sonar, a military technology that used sound to search the underwater environment. Though the expeditions found nothing conclusive, in each case the sonar operators detected large, moving underwater objects they could not explain. (To learn how sonar works, see <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/lochness/sonar.html">Experiment with Sonar.</a>)</p>

<h3>
	high-tech searches</h3>
<p>
	The use of technology to search the loch reached a new level in the 1970s, when a series of expeditions was sponsored by the Boston-based Academy of Applied Science, whose members included many technically skilled people with ties to MIT. The Academy&#x27;s approach was to set a trap for the monster by combining sonar and underwater photography for the first time. Under the leadership of Robert Rines, a lawyer trained in physics, the team pointed a sophisticated form of sonar, called side scan sonar, out into Loch Ness from a point near the shore. Nearby they placed an underwater camera taking pictures every 45 seconds as a strobe light illuminated the depths with a bright flash. The system paid off one night in 1975. At the same moment the sonar was registering a large, moving object, the underwater camera was taking pictures of an object that looked, after development and computer enhancement, like the flippers of an aquatic creature.</p>
<p>
	Rines&#x27; discovery won the support of two reputable scientists: Harold &quot;Doc&quot; Edgerton, the legendary MIT scientist who had invented side scan sonar and strobe photography; and Sir Peter Scott, one of Britain&#x27;s most respected naturalists. With Edgerton and Scott behind him, Rines was given an opportunity to present his evidence at a hearing at the House of Commons in London. Never had the possibility of the Loch Ness Monster been taken so seriously.</p>
<p>
	Almost immediately, however, critics began to raise questions about the evidence. Could the suggestive sonar traces be the result of human error? Had the flipper photos been altered to improve their appearance? Just as damaging to Rines&#x27; case was Peter Scott&#x27;s bold pronouncement about the identity of the creature. Based on the flipper photos and the eyewitness sightings, Scott concluded that Nessie was a plesiosaur, an ancient reptile that was thought to have gone extinct along with the dinosaurs some 65 million years ago. The idea was just too far-fetched for professional zoologists to take seriously.</p>

<p>
	Although zoologists have yet to conduct the full-scale investigation Rines hoped to trigger, the loch continues to yield intriguing sonar hits. In 1987, an expedition called Operation Deep Scan used a flotilla of 20 sonar-equipped boats to sweep the loch with a curtain of sound; the operation yielded three underwater targets that could not be explained. In the early 1990s, the BBC&#x27;s Nicholas Witchell helped organize Project Urquhart, the first extensive study of the loch&#x27;s biology and geology. Although they weren&#x27;t looking for monsters, the expedition&#x27;s sonar operators detected a large, moving underwater target and followed it for several minutes before losing it. And during the 1997 expedition featured in NOVA&#x27;s Loch Ness film, Rines and his longtime colleague Charles Wyckoff detected yet another puzzling underwater target. According to the expedition&#x27;s sonar expert, marine biologist Arne Carr, it was a moving target, appeared to be biological in nature, and was about 15 feet long‚Äîthe size of a small whale.</p>
<h3>
<b>Famous Photo Falsified?</b></h3>
<p>
	In the 65 years since the birth of the modern legend, dozens of people have come forward with photographs purporting to show the monster. Most were quickly dismissed as either outright frauds or images of ordinary objects mistaken for monsters. But one photo stood above the rest. Taken in 1934, it shows what appears to be the slender neck of an animal rising from the surface of the water. From the moment it was published in the <cite>London Daily Mail,</cite> it became the very image of the Loch Ness Monster and, for many, the strongest evidence that Nessie actually exists.</p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>
	One reason the photograph had such an impact on the Loch Ness legend was that it came from such a credible source. The photo was sold to the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> by a London physician named R. Kenneth Wilson, who said he had taken the picture when he noticed a commotion in the water as he was driving up from London to photograph birds with a friend near Inverness. Few believed that such a respected doctor could be party to a deception.</p>

<p></p>
<p>
	But in 1994, 60 years after the photo was first published, newspapers around the world reported the claim that the &quot;surgeon&#x27;s photo&quot; was a fake, part of an elaborate plot to dupe the <cite>Daily Mail.</cite> The man behind the story was a former English art teacher named Alastair Boyd, who had become an avid student of Loch Ness lore after he and his wife had had their own sighting of a large animal in the loch in 1979. Years later, a friend of Boyd&#x27;s named David Martin discovered an old newspaper clipping in which Ian Wetherell (the son of Marmaduke Wetherell of hippo foot fame) claimed the surgeon&#x27;s photo was a hoax. The article had attracted little attention when it was published in 1975, but two details caught Boyd&#x27;s eye.</p>
<p>
	First, Wetherell said the plot had involved a man named Maurice Chambers‚Äîthe very same man that Dr. Wilson said he had driven up from London to visit in 1934. Second, Wetherell mentioned that the surgeon&#x27;s photograph included the scenery of Loch Ness in the background. In fact, the familiar Nessie photo includes only the protruding neck and the water around it. Boyd knew that the original photo <b>had</b> included a bit of the far shoreline in the background, because he had rediscovered the uncropped version in the late &#x27;80s. But that full photo had been published only once, in 1934. So how could Wetherell have known this detail? &quot;Either he had a very long memory, or he took the picture,&quot; Boyd says.</p>
<p>

<p></p>
<p>
	Ian Wetherell had died by the time Boyd and Martin read the article, but they were able to track down his step-brother, Christian Spurling, in the south of England. Spurling, 93 and near death, confessed. Unhappy with the way he was treated by the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> after the hippo foot fiasco, Duke Wetherell had set out to get his revenge, enlisting his son and step-son in the plot. First Spurling built a model monster by grafting a head and neck onto the conning tower of a toy submarine. Then Wetherell and his son Ian drove up to the loch and staged the photograph, taking care to include the actual Loch Ness scenery in the background. Finally, to conceal his own role in the hoax, Wetherell persuaded Dr. Wilson, through their common friend Chambers, to have the photo developed and sell it to the <cite>Daily Mail</cite> as his own. The plot worked better than any of them could have imagined.</p>
<p>
	Not everyone accepts the Spurling story. American journalist Richard Smith, for example, notes that toy experts question whether the toy submarines of the 1930s could have performed as described, and he wonders why Boyd waited until after Spurling&#x27;s death to reveal his confession. But in the aftermath of Boyd&#x27;s 1994 bombshell, most people now believe the surgeon&#x27;s photo was yet another Loch Ness hoax.</p>

	Does that finally disprove the monster&#x27;s existence? Not at all, says Boyd. One of the great ironies of the Loch Ness story is that the man who brought down the most famous piece of evidence remains a firm believer in Nessie. &quot;I am so convinced of the reality of these creatures that I would actually stake my life on their existence,&quot; he told NOVA. &quot;I trust my eyesight ... I used to make my living teaching people how to observe, and I know that the thing I saw was not a log or an otter or a wave, or anything like that. It was a large animal. It came heaving out of the water, something like a whale. I mean, the part that was actually on the surface when it stopped rolling through was at least 20 feet long. It was totally extraordinary. It&#x27;s the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life, and if I could afford to spend the rest of my life looking for another glimpse of it, I would.&quot;</p><div

From the carved, standing stones still found in the region around Loch Ness, it is clear the Picts were fascinated by animals, and careful to render them with great fidelity. All the animals depicted on the Pictish stones are lifelike and easily recognizable‚Äîall but one. The exception is a strange beast with an elongated beak or muzzle, a head locket or spout, and flippers instead of feet. Described by some scholars as a swimming elephant, the Pictish beast is the earliest known evidence for an idea that has held sway in the Scottish Highlands for at least 1,500 years‚Äîthat Loch Ness is home to a mysterious aquatic animal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tIn Scottish folklore, large animals have been associated with many bodies of water, from small streams to the largest lakes, often labeled Loch-na-Beistie on old maps. These water-horses, or water-kelpies, are said to have magical powers and malevolent intentions. According to one version of the legend, the water-horse lures small children into the water by offering them rides on its back. Once the children are aboard, their hands become stuck to the beast and they are dragged to a watery death, their livers washing ashore the following day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tThe earliest written reference linking such creatures to Loch Ness is in the biography of Saint Columba, the man credited with introducing Christianity to Scotland. In A.D. 565, according to this account, Columba was on his way to visit a Pictish king when he stopped along the shore of Loch Ness. Seeing a large beast about to attack a man who was swimming in the lake, Columba raised his hand, invoking the name of God and commanding the monster to \"go back with all speed.\" The beast complied, and the swimmer was saved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"richtext-image full-width\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"Daily Mail newspaper headline of Loch Ness\" class=\"richtext-image full-width\" src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/legend-loch-ness-02.width-990_P6Uqn9e.jpg\"/\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe Loch Ness Monster has been headline news all over the world for more than 60 years.\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"credit\"\u003eDaily Mail\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tWhen Nicholas Witchell, a future BBC correspondent, researched the history of the legend for his 1974 book \u003ccite\u003eThe Loch Ness Story,\u003c/cite\u003e he found about a dozen pre-20th-century references to large animals in Loch Ness, gradually shifting in character from these clearly mythical accounts to something more like eyewitness descriptions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\r\n\ta 20th-century sensation\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tThe modern legend of Loch Ness dates from 1933, when a new road was completed along the shore, offering the first clear views of the loch from the northern side. One April afternoon, a local couple was driving home along this road when they spotted \"an enormous animal rolling and plunging on the surface.\" Their account was written up by a correspondent for the \u003ccite\u003eInverness Courier,\u003c/cite\u003e whose editor used the word \"monster\" to describe the animal. The Loch Ness Monster has been a media phenomenon ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tPublic interest built gradually during the spring of 1933, then picked up sharply after a couple reported seeing one of the creatures on land, lumbering across the shore road. By October, several London newspapers had sent correspondents to Scotland, and radio programs were being interrupted to bring listeners the latest news from the loch. A British circus offered a reward of ¬£20,000 for the capture of the beast. Hundreds of boy scouts and outdoorsmen arrived, some venturing out in small boats, others setting up deck chairs and waiting expectantly for the monster to appear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tThe excitement over the monster reached a fever pitch in December, when the \u003ccite\u003eLondon Daily Mail\u003c/cite\u003e hired an actor, film director, and big-game hunter named Marmaduke Wetherell to track down the beast. After only a few days at the loch, Wetherell reported finding the fresh footprints of a large, four-toed animal. He estimated it to be 20 feet long. With great fanfare, Wetherell made plaster casts of the footprints and, just before Christmas, sent them off to the Natural History Museum in London for analysis. While the world waited for the museum zoologists to return from holiday, legions of monster hunters descended on Loch Ness, filling the local hotels. Inverness was floodlit for the occasion, and traffic jammed the shoreline roads in both directions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"richtext-image full-width\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"Marmaduke Wetherell\" class=\"richtext-image full-width\" src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/legend-loch-ness-03.width-990_sAK9gtW.jpg\"/\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003eBig-game hunter Marmaduke Wetherell\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"credit\"\u003eABC News\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tThe bubble burst in early January, when museum zoologists announced that the footprints were those of a hippopotamus. They had been made with a stuffed hippo foot‚Äîthe base of an umbrella stand or ashtray. It wasn't clear whether Wetherell was the perpetrator of the hoax or its gullible victim. Either way, the incident tainted the image of the Loch Ness Monster and discouraged serious investigation of the phenomenon. For the next three decades, most scientists scornfully dismissed reports of strange animals in the loch. Those sightings that weren't outright hoaxes, they said, were the result of optical illusions caused by boat wakes, wind slicks, floating logs, otters, ducks, or swimming deer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eSaw Something, They Did\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tNevertheless, eyewitnesses continued to come forward with accounts of their sightings‚Äîmore than 4,000 of them, according to Witchell's estimate. Most of the witnesses described a large creature with one or more humps protruding above the surface like the hull of an upturned boat. Others reported seeing a long neck or flippers. What was most remarkable, however, was that many of the eyewitnesses were sober, level-headed people: lawyers and priests, scientists and school teachers, policemen and fishermen‚Äîeven a Nobel Prize winner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tIn the 1950s, a local doctor named Constance Whyte began collecting these eyewitness accounts, along with sketches of what the people had seen, finally publishing them in 1957 as a book entitled \u003ccite\u003eMore Than a Legend.\u003c/cite\u003e Noting that many of her friends had been subjected to ridicule and contempt, Whyte said her goal in writing the book was \"the vindication of many people of integrity who had reported honestly what they had seen in Loch Ness.\" (To hear recent personal anecdotes, see \u003ca href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/lochness/eyewitness.html\"\u003eEyewitness Accounts.\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"richtext-image full-width\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"car with camera\" class=\"richtext-image full-width\" src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/legend-loch-ness-04.width-990_daxvBp5.jpg\"/\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003eIn the 1960s a group of dedicated amateurs formed the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau to keep a constant vigil on the loch.\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"credit\"\u003eBBC-Tomorrow's World\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tWhyte's book inspired a new generation of monster hunters, including Tim Dinsdale, who on his first visit to the loch in 1960 took an intriguing film of something moving across the loch‚Äîand promptly gave up his career as an aeronautical engineer to devote his life to pursuing the monster. The next year, a group of dedicated amateurs formed the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau, keeping a constant vigil on the loch from an observation post on the northern shore.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tBut perhaps the most important effect of Whyte's book was to turn the tide of public opinion. Long dismissed as fodder for \"silly season\" press reports, Nessie was finally considered a subject worthy of serious scientific investigation. In the span of a decade, beginning in 1958, four separate expeditions were launched, first by the BBC, then by three respected British universities: Oxford, Cambridge, and the University of Birmingham. Rather than scanning the surface with binoculars and cameras, as the amateur investigators had, these expeditions came equipped with sonar, a military technology that used sound to search the underwater environment. Though the expeditions found nothing conclusive, in each case the sonar operators detected large, moving underwater objects they could not explain. (To learn how sonar works, see \u003ca href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/lochness/sonar.html\"\u003eExperiment with Sonar.\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"richtext-image full-width\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" class=\"richtext-image full-width\" src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/legend-loch-ness-05.width-990_uMskCkr.jpg\"/\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003eIn 1987, Operation Deep Scan, the most ambitious sonar survey of Loch Ness, found three unexplained underwater targets.\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"credit\"\u003eNorth Scene Video\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\r\n\thigh-tech searches\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tThe use of technology to search the loch reached a new level in the 1970s, when a series of expeditions was sponsored by the Boston-based Academy of Applied Science, whose members included many technically skilled people with ties to MIT. The Academy's approach was to set a trap for the monster by combining sonar and underwater photography for the first time. Under the leadership of Robert Rines, a lawyer trained in physics, the team pointed a sophisticated form of sonar, called side scan sonar, out into Loch Ness from a point near the shore. Nearby they placed an underwater camera taking pictures every 45 seconds as a strobe light illuminated the depths with a bright flash. The system paid off one night in 1975. At the same moment the sonar was registering a large, moving object, the underwater camera was taking pictures of an object that looked, after development and computer enhancement, like the flippers of an aquatic creature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tRines' discovery won the support of two reputable scientists: Harold \"Doc\" Edgerton, the legendary MIT scientist who had invented side scan sonar and strobe photography; and Sir Peter Scott, one of Britain's most respected naturalists. With Edgerton and Scott behind him, Rines was given an opportunity to present his evidence at a hearing at the House of Commons in London. Never had the possibility of the Loch Ness Monster been taken so seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tAlmost immediately, however, critics began to raise questions about the evidence. Could the suggestive sonar traces be the result of human error? Had the flipper photos been altered to improve their appearance? Just as damaging to Rines' case was Peter Scott's bold pronouncement about the identity of the creature. Based on the flipper photos and the eyewitness sightings, Scott concluded that Nessie was a plesiosaur, an ancient reptile that was thought to have gone extinct along with the dinosaurs some 65 million years ago. The idea was just too far-fetched for professional zoologists to take seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"richtext-image full-width\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"painting of plesiosaur\" class=\"richtext-image full-width\" src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/legend-loch-ness-06.width-990_R1krroa.jpg\"/\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003eThis painting by Sir Peter Scott, a respected British naturalist, helped create the popular image of Nessie as an ancient reptile called a plesiosaur.\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"credit\"\u003eAdrian Shrine/Bob Rines\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tAlthough zoologists have yet to conduct the full-scale investigation Rines hoped to trigger, the loch continues to yield intriguing sonar hits. In 1987, an expedition called Operation Deep Scan used a flotilla of 20 sonar-equipped boats to sweep the loch with a curtain of sound; the operation yielded three underwater targets that could not be explained. In the early 1990s, the BBC's Nicholas Witchell helped organize Project Urquhart, the first extensive study of the loch's biology and geology. Although they weren't looking for monsters, the expedition's sonar operators detected a large, moving underwater target and followed it for several minutes before losing it. And during the 1997 expedition featured in NOVA's Loch Ness film, Rines and his longtime colleague Charles Wyckoff detected yet another puzzling underwater target. According to the expedition's sonar expert, marine biologist Arne Carr, it was a moving target, appeared to be biological in nature, and was about 15 feet long‚Äîthe size of a small whale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\n\u003cb\u003eFamous Photo Falsified?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tIn the 65 years since the birth of the modern legend, dozens of people have come forward with photographs purporting to show the monster. Most were quickly dismissed as either outright frauds or images of ordinary objects mistaken for monsters. But one photo stood above the rest. Taken in 1934, it shows what appears to be the slender neck of an animal rising from the surface of the water. From the moment it was published in the \u003ccite\u003eLondon Daily Mail,\u003c/cite\u003e it became the very image of the Loch Ness Monster and, for many, the strongest evidence that Nessie actually exists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"richtext-image full-width\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" class=\"richtext-image full-width\" src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/legend-loch-ness-07.width-990_lxEegfJ.jpg\"/\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe \"surgeon's photo,\" published in 1934, became the very image of the Loch Ness Monster.\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"credit\"\u003eFortean Pictures Library\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tOne reason the photograph had such an impact on the Loch Ness legend was that it came from such a credible source. The photo was sold to the \u003ccite\u003eDaily Mail\u003c/cite\u003e by a London physician named R. Kenneth Wilson, who said he had taken the picture when he noticed a commotion in the water as he was driving up from London to photograph birds with a friend near Inverness.

Years later, a friend of Boyd's named David Martin discovered an old newspaper clipping in which Ian Wetherell (the son of Marmaduke Wetherell of hippo foot fame) claimed the surgeon's photo was a hoax. The article had attracted little attention when it was published in 1975, but two details caught Boyd's eye.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tFirst, Wetherell said the plot had involved a man named Maurice Chambers‚Äîthe very same man that Dr. Wilson said he had driven up from London to visit in 1934. Second, Wetherell mentioned that the surgeon's photograph included the scenery of Loch Ness in the background. In fact, the familiar Nessie photo includes only the protruding neck and the water around it. Boyd knew that the original photo \u003cb\u003ehad\u003c/b\u003e included a bit of the far shoreline in the background, because he had rediscovered the uncropped version in the late '80s. But that full photo had been published only once, in 1934. So how could Wetherell have known this detail? \"Either he had a very long memory, or he took the picture,\" Boyd says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"richtext-image full-width\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"surgeon's photo uncropped\" class=\"richtext-image full-width\" src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/legend-loch-ness-09.width-990_cZsuksq.jpg\"/\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe full, uncropped surgeon's photo, published only once in 1934, was rediscovered by Boyd more than 50 years later.\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"credit\"\u003eFortean Pictures Library\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tIan Wetherell had died by the time Boyd and Martin read the article, but they were able to track down his step-brother, Christian Spurling, in the south of England. Spurling, 93 and near death, confessed. Unhappy with the way he was treated by the \u003ccite\u003eDaily Mail\u003c/cite\u003e after the hippo foot fiasco, Duke Wetherell had set out to get his revenge, enlisting his son and step-son in the plot. First Spurling built a model monster by grafting a head and neck onto the conning tower of a toy submarine. Then Wetherell and his son Ian drove up to the loch and staged the photograph, taking care to include the actual Loch Ness scenery in the background. Finally, to conceal his own role in the hoax, Wetherell persuaded Dr. Wilson, through their common friend Chambers, to have the photo developed and sell it to the \u003ccite\u003eDaily Mail\u003c/cite\u003e as his own. The plot worked better than any of them could have imagined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tNot everyone accepts the Spurling story. American journalist Richard Smith, for example, notes that toy experts question whether the toy submarines of the 1930s could have performed as described, and he wonders why Boyd waited until after Spurling's death to reveal his confession. But in the aftermath of Boyd's 1994 bombshell, most people now believe the surgeon's photo was yet another Loch Ness hoax.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"richtext-image full-width\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" class=\"richtext-image full-width\" src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/legend-loch-ness-10.width-990_HAjnJ2Z.jpg\"/\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe 93-year-old stepson of Marmaduke Wetherell told Boyd he made the monster in the picture by grafting a plastic wood neck to a toy submarine.\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"credit\"\u003e¬© WGBH Educational Foundation\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tDoes that finally disprove the monster's existence? Not at all, says Boyd. One of the great ironies of the Loch Ness story is that the man who brought down the most famous piece of evidence remains a firm believer in Nessie. \"I am so convinced of the reality of these creatures that I would actually stake my life on their existence,\" he told NOVA. \"I trust my eyesight ... I used to make my living teaching people how to observe, and I know that the thing I saw was not a log or an otter or a wave, or anything like that. It was a large animal. It came heaving out of the water, something like a whale. I mean, the part that was actually on the surface when it stopped rolling through was at least 20 feet long. It was totally extraordinary.

Namely, why did the Bible become a book at all? This question began to haunt me more and more as I studied the archeology of ancient Palestine and the early history of Hebrew writing. Scholars agree that early Israel was an oral society of pastoralism and subsistence farming. So how and why did such a pastoral-agrarian society come to write down and give authority to the written word? How and why did writing spread from the closed circles of royal and priestly scribes to the lay classes? It was this spread of Hebrew writing in ancient Palestine that democratized the written word and allowed it to gain religious authority in the book we now call \"the Bible.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tWhen the Bible became a book, the written word supplanted the living voice of the teacher. Ancient Israelite society was \u003cem\u003etextualized\u003c/em\u003e. This textualization marked one of the great turning points in human history, namely the movement from an oral culture towards a written culture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tWe tend to read the Bible from our own viewpoint‚Äîthat is, we tend to think of the Bible as if it came from a world of texts, books, and authors. But the Bible was written before there were books. As the great French scholar Henri-Jean Martin has observed, the role of writing in society has changed dramatically through history, yet modern analyses of biblical literature often depend on the perspective of the text in modern society. Using the most recent advances in the archeology of Palestine and relying on insights from linguistic anthropology, I came to new conclusions about why and when the Bible began to be written down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\r\n\tThe magical writing of priests and kings\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tIn ancient Palestine, writing was a restricted and expensive technology. Writing was controlled by the government and manipulated by the priests. Writing was seen as a gift from the gods. It was not used to canonize religious practice, but rather to engender religious awe. Writing was magical. It was powerful. It was the guarded knowledge of political and religious elites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"richtext-image full-width\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"Inscription alphabet\" class=\"richtext-image full-width\" src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/origins-written-bible-02.width-990_QttZRHw.jpg\"/\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003eThis inscription of a proto-Hebrew alphabet, found at Tel Zayit and dating to the 10th century B.C., is early evidence of Israelite writing.\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"credit\"\u003e¬© WGBH Educational Foundation\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tWe know from ancient inscriptions that writing did not require well-developed states like those of ancient Egypt or Mesopotamia. For example, the tiny city-states in Canaan during the late 2nd millennium B.C. each had their own scribe. Excavations at Tel Amarna in Egypt uncovered correspondence from these petty rulers in Canaan to the great pharaohs of the New Kingdom during the 14th century B.C. Other evidence, documented in NOVA's \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/bible/\"\u003eThe Bible's Buried Secrets\u003c/a\u003e,\" turned up in 2005, when a proto-Hebrew abecedary (that is, an alphabet inscription) dated to the 10th century B.C. was excavated at Tel Zayit in Israel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tMany early inscriptions were used in religious rituals, reflecting the belief in the magical power of writing. The well-known Gezer Calendar, a series of notes about planting and harvesting that dates to the 10th century B.C., was probably written on soft limestone so that the writing could be scraped off in such a ritual, with the written words literally becoming a kind of magic fertilizer blessing the agricultural year. Other inscriptions such as an early-ninth-century royal inscription from the tiny chiefdom of Moab (in ancient Jordan) were display inscriptions‚Äîthey were located in prominent places by kings and chiefs, not to be read but to be seen. An aspiring king projected power by his control and manipulation of writing. But eventually writing would break free from these restricted uses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"richtext-image full-width\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"Gezer Calendar\" class=\"richtext-image full-width\" src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/origins-written-bible-03.width-990_5NdPEQd.jpg\"/\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe Gezer Calendar may have been etched in soft limestone so that the writing could be scraped off in a magical ritual.\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"credit\"\u003eCourtesy www.HolyLandPhotos.org\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\r\n\tThe spread of literacy and origins of biblical literature\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tThe invention of alphabetic writing was a pivotal development in the history of writing, but it alone did not encourage the spread of writing beyond the palace and the temple. Recent discoveries at Wadi el-Hol in Egypt date the invention of the alphabet back to 2000 B.C., and for centuries after, writing likely remained the province of the elite. So what allowed the alphabet to spread beyond religious and literary elites to be used by soldiers, merchants, and even common workmen? It was the urbanization and globalization of society. This process began in the eighth century B.C. with the rise of the Assyrian Empire, which encouraged urbanization as part of a plan for economically exploiting its growing territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tI believe that the formative period for the writing of biblical literature also began at this time and stretched roughly from the eighth through the sixth century B.C., when the social and political conditions for the expansion of writing in ancient Israel flourished. With the rise of the Assyrian Empire, ancient Palestine became more urban, and writing became critical to the increasingly complex economy. Writing was important to the bureaucracy of Jerusalem. It also continued to serve as an ideological tool projecting the power of kings. At the end of the eighth century in both Mesopotamia and Egypt, rulers were collecting the ancient books, and ancient Judeans followed their model‚Äîcollecting the traditions, stories, and laws of their ancestors into written manuscripts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\t\tBiblical literature became a tool that legitimated and furthered the priests' political and religious authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tThe evidence of archeology and inscriptions suggests a spread of writing through all classes of society by the seventh century B.C. in Judah. This allowed for a momentous shift in the role of writing in society that is reflected in the reforms of King Josiah at the end of the seventh century; writing became a tool of religious reformers who first proclaimed the authority of the written word. This new role of the written word is particularly reflected in the Book of Deuteronomy, which commands the masses to write down the words of God, to read it and treasure it in their hearts, and to post the written word on the entrance to their homes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"richtext-image full-width\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"Prayers on home entrance\" class=\"richtext-image full-width\" src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/origins-written-bible-04.width-990_cERyojq.jpg\"/\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe Book of Deuteronomy, likely compiled around the 7th century B.C., instructed ancient Israelites to post prayers on the entrances of their homes, as Jews do today with mezuzahs containing tiny scrolls.\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"credit\"\u003eCourtesy The Jewish Learning Experience www.jle.org\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tTo be sure, this shift in the role of writing encroached on groups with a vested interest in the authority of the oral tradition or the prophetic word.

However, it was hardly a time when biblical literature could flourish. The exile resulted in a massive depopulation of the land of Israel. Archeological surveys suggest the region was depopulated by as much as 80 percent, and in Babylon the situation was grim for the exiles‚Äîwith the exception of the royal family.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tIt is hardly credible that Jewish exiles working on Babylonian canal projects wrote or even valued literature. However, the royal entourage of the last kings of Judah were living in the southern palace of the Babylonian kings, and they retained their claim to the throne in Jerusalem. They collected literature from the royal and temple library, as well as wrote and edited literature that advanced their claims and standing. But the high status of the royal family and its role in the formation of biblical literature seems to disappear by the end of the sixth century B.C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tThe region of Palestine, especially in the hills around Jerusalem, continued to be sparsely populated and impoverished in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.

Increasingly, archeology has filled in the void but painted a bleak picture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tMost biblical literature was written long before this dark age.

The very language of Scripture changed as society became more textualized. Most tellingly, the Hebrew word \u003cem\u003etorah\u003c/em\u003e, which originally meant \"teaching, instruction,\" increasingly began to refer to a written text, \"the \u003cem\u003eTorah\u003c/em\u003e of Moses,\" (also known as the Pentateuch) in the Second Temple period (530 B.C.‚ÄìA.D. 130).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tThe tension between the authority of the oral tradition and the written word, the teacher and the text, continued in the Second Temple period among the various Jewish groups. The priestly aristocracy controlled the temple library and the sacred texts. They were literate elites whose authority was threatened by the oral tradition. Groups like the Pharisees, in contrast, were largely composed of the lay classes. They invested authority in the teacher and the oral tradition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\t\tStill, a fierce ideology of orality would persist in rabbinic Judaism.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tBoth early Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism, which grew out of the lay classes, struggled with the tension between the sacred text and the authority of the oral tradition in the aftermath of the destruction of the Temple in A.D. 70. Although they acknowledged the authority of the written Scriptures, they also asserted the authority of the living voice of the teacher.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tChristianity, however, quickly adopted the codex‚Äîthe precursor of the modern book. Codices, with bound leaves of pages, appeared in the first century A.D. and became common by the fourth century. The codex could encompass a much more extensive series of texts than a single scroll could contain. In bringing together a collection of scrolls, the codex also defined a set and order of books and made possible a more defined canon. It was with the technological invention of the codex that the \"Bible\" as a book, that is, the Bible as we know it, first got its physical form. The adoption of the codex probably encouraged the authority of the written Scriptures in the early Church.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tJudaism, in contrast, was quite slow in adopting the codex and even today it is a Torah \u003cem\u003escroll\u003c/em\u003e that we find in a synagogue ark. Eventually, Judaism too would cloak its oral tradition in a written garb. Still, a fierce ideology of orality would persist in rabbinic Judaism even as the oral Torah and the written tablets were merged into what, according to doctrine, is one pre-existent Torah that was with God at the very creation of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"richtext-image full-width\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"The Torah\" class=\"richtext-image full-width\" src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/origins-written-bible-06.width-990_DWNYtCp.jpg\"/\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe Torah remains at the core of Jewish identity and religion, as well as a link to the ancient past.\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"credit\"\u003e¬© WGBH Educational Foundation\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","author":["william-schniedewind"],"short_description":"William Schniedewind charts the rise of literacy in the Israelite world, making Holy Scripture possible.","hits_weekly":0,"hits_daily":0,"card":{"title":"Origins of the Written Bible","slug":"origins-written-bible","page_type":"article","contentType":"application/vnd.theseus+page"}}},{"_index":"content","_type":"doc","_id":"article-150","_score":3.2315016,"_source":{"slug":"iceman-last-meal","title":"The Iceman's Last Meal","topic":"ancient","brand":"nova","content_type":"article","publish_date":"1998-11-24","external":false,"published":true,"content":"\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"richtext-image full-width\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" class=\"richtext-image full-width\" src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/iceman-last-meal-01.width-990_rjaQQ6h.jpg\"/\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe 5000-year-old mummy known as the \"Iceman,\" here laid out on an examination table\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"credit\"\u003e¬© WGBH Educational Foundation\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tThe meal was a simple affair, consisting of a bit of unleavened bread made of einkorn wheat, one of the few domesticated grains used in the Iceman's part of the world at this time, some other plant, possibly an herb or other green, and meat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tOeggl reconstructed the Iceman's last meal from his microscopic analysis of a tiny sample removed from the mummy's transverse colon, the part of the intestine just beyond the stomach. When the Iceman was discovered in 1991, x-rays and CAT-scans of the corpse revealed that his internal organs had shrunken so drastically in the 5,300 years in the glacier that Dr. Dieter Zur Nedden, the radiologist who examined the images, could barely distinguish them.

The progress of the food indicated that the Iceman had last eaten about eight hours before he died, possibly of hypothermia, on the Hauslabjoch pass, which cuts over the main Alpine ridge dividing Austria from Italy at 10,500 feet above sea level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tNot until several years after the discovery did the Innsbruck scientists finally cut a hole into the mummy, insert an endoscope, and snip out about .004 ounces from the colon. Dr. Werner Platzer, the University of Innsbruck anatomist then in charge of research on the corpse, gave .0016 ounces milligrams of the material to Oeggl, who had already been studying the rich botanical finds from the site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\tPollen provided a snapshot of the environment the Iceman was exposed to in the hours before his death\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tOeggl's sample was barely the size of his little fingernail. Under the microscope, he quickly identified the flake-like, semi-digested material that made up the bulk of the sample as einkorn, the most important wheat of the Neolithic, the period of prehistory in which people lived in semi-permanent settlements and survived by agriculture and keeping animals. The discovery of einkorn, which does not occur naturally in Europe, in the Iceman's intestinal tract suggested that he had contact with an agricultural community. The dominance of bran in the sample led Oeggl to believe that the wheat had been finely ground into meal and made into bread, rather than eaten as a porridge, where the grains would have been eaten whole and found in larger pieces in the colon. But the bread would have been little like modern breads. In order to get bread to rise when yeast is added, the wheat grains must contain a high level of gluten, which lends the dough a durable elasticity and therefore holds the pockets of air. Einkorn has low levels of gluten, so the bread made with it was probably hard, somewhat like a cracker, and rather tough on the teeth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003cfigure class=\"richtext-image full-width\"\u003e\n\u003cimg alt=\"\" class=\"richtext-image full-width\" src=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/media/images/iceman-last-meal-03.width-990_sg1higd.jpg\"/\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\u003eWheat spiklets derived from Einkorn grain, stuck to the Iceman's clothing\n        \n        \u003cdiv class=\"credit\"\u003eReprinted by permission of Blackwell Science, Inc.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tUsing an electron microscope Oeggl also spotted tiny particles of charcoal attached to the bran, probably remnants of the baking process on a hot rock, or next to a fire. In addition to the einkorn, the cells of at least one other plant, possibly some herb, were present in the sample, and Oeggl concluded that they, too, had been part of his meal. He also found a tiny muscle fiber and a burned bit of bone, evidence that the Iceman might also have eaten a meat. What kind of meat Oeggl cannot yet say, nor can he determine how much of the meal the sample represented.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tNot everything passing through the Iceman's gut had been swallowed intentionally, or was even desirable. Oeggl also found the eggs of the human whipworm. Many people alive today who do not live in areas with flush toilets also carry the worm, which can cause unpleasant symptoms like stomach ache and diarrhea, or even lead to malnutrition. The scientists have no way of knowing whether the Iceman had any such complaints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\r\n\tScientists may never know what prompted the Iceman to leave the relatively hospitable valley with no water or food to speak of\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tThe sample also contained many different varieties of pollen, whose strange and beautiful forms Oeggl saw under the electron microscope. Though some peoples are known to eat pollen, Oeggl believed that the quantity in his colon was too small to represent a meal. Instead, the pollen accidentally ended up in the man's stomach because they either had landed in food or water he ingested, or were inhaled and became trapped in saliva which he then swallowed. Scientists had long wondered where the Iceman was coming from and where he was headed, but until the discovery of the pollen inside the corpse, no scientist had any convincing documentation for his last day. But the pollen provided a snapshot of the environment the Iceman was exposed to in the hours before his death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tThe majority of the pollen came from the hop hornbeam tree, which grows in a warm environment. As soon as Oeggl recognized it under his microscope lens, he not only knew which side of the mountain the Iceman had been on shortly before his death, but also the season in which he died.

The fleet consisted of giant nine-masted junks, escorted by dozens of supply ships, water tankers, transports for cavalry horses, and patrol boats. The armada's crew totaled more than 27,000 sailors and soldiers. The largest of the junks were said to be over 400 feet long and 150 feet wide.

Here was one of history's great turning points. Had the Chinese emperors continued their huge investments in the treasure fleets, there is little reason why they, rather than the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and British, should not have colonized the world. Yet less than a century later, all overseas trade was banned, and it became a capital offense to set sail from China in a multi-masted ship.

But it was the subsequent Mongol emperors (the Yuan dynasty of c. 1271-1368) who commissioned the first imperial treasure fleets and founded trading posts in Sumatra, Ceylon, and southern India.

The enterprising spirit of the Ming era reached a climax following the rebellion of the warrior prince Zhu Di, who usurped the throne in 1402. Disapproved of by the Confucian \"establishment,\" Zhu Di put his trust in the worldly eunuchs who had always sought their fortunes in commerce.

If accurate, these dimensions would signal the biggest wooden ships ever built.

One of the most intensively studied wrecks, found at Quanzhou in 1973, dates from the earlier Song period; this substantial double-masted ship probably sank sometime in the 1270s. Its V-shaped hull is framed around a pine keel over 100 feet long and covered with a double layer of intricately fitted cedar planking, thus clearly indicating its oceangoing character. Inside, 13 compartments held the residue of an exotic cargo of spices, shells, and fragrant woods, much of it originating in east Africa (see \u003ca href=\"/wgbh/nova/sultan/archeology.html\" target=\"_top\"\u003eAsia's Undersea Archeology\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\r\n\tThe Quanzhou wreck suggests that over a century before Zheng He's fabled voyages, the Chinese were already involved in ambitious trading exploits across the Indian Ocean.
