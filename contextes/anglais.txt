       Alfred Lord Tennyson's Idylls of the King, a series of twelve poems

       historian Geoffrey of Monmouth. They were added to and developed by
       French writers such as Chrétien de Troyes, who wrote during the
       period 1170-90, and also became the centre of a group of legends in
       Germany. As a result, other characters such as Lancelot, Tristram
       (Tristan) and Perceval (Parzival) became associated with Arthur and
       were included by Malory in Le Morte D'Arthur, the version of the
       legends which became most widely known in Britain.The stories of
       Arthur and his knights celebrate the age of chivalry, when knights
       aimed to live according to the highest Christian principles. Their

       the son of Uther Pendragon, King of all England. One version says
       that at a young age he was put under a spell by the magician Merlin

       He became King at the age of 15 after he pulled the magic sword
       Excalibur out of a stone when all the other knights had failed to
       do so. Another version of the legend says that he received the
       sword from the Lady of the Lake, and this fits in with the story
       that, as he was dying, he ordered the sword to be thrown back into

       the graves of Arthur and Guinevere.

   [220px-Lady_Godiva_%28John_Collier%2C_c._1897%29.jpg] In this 1897
   painting of Lady Godiva by John Collier, the authentic historical
   person is fully submerged in the legend, presented in an anachronistic
   high medieval setting.

   A legend is a genre of folklore that consists of a narrative featuring
   human actions, believed or perceived to have taken place in human
   history. Narratives in this genre may demonstrate human values, and
--
   may be transformed over time to keep them fresh and vital.

   Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being
   entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely
   doubted.^[1] Legends are sometimes distinguished from myths in that
--
   have supernatural origins, and sometimes in that they have some sort of
   historical basis whereas myths generally do not.^[2]^[3] The Brothers
   Grimm defined legend as "folktale historically grounded".^[4] A
   by-product of the "concern with human beings" is the long list of
   legendary creatures, leaving no "resolute doubt" that legends are
   "historically grounded."

   A modern folklorist's professional definition of legend was proposed by
   Timothy R. Tangherlini in 1990:^[5]

   [180px-Holger_danske.jpg] Holger Danske, a legendary character

   Legend is a loanword from Old French that entered English usage c.
   1340. The Old French noun legende derives from the Medieval Latin
   legenda.^[7] In its early English-language usage, the word indicated a
   narrative of an event. The word legendary was originally a noun
   (introduced in the 1510s) meaning a collection or corpus of
   legends.^[8]^[9] This word changed to legendry, and legendary became
   the adjectival form.^[8]

--
   wished to imply that an event (especially the story of any saint not
   acknowledged in John Foxe's Actes and Monuments) was fictitious. Thus,
   legend gained its modern connotations of "undocumented" and "spurious",
   which distinguish it from the meaning of chronicle.^[10]

   In 1866, Jacob Grimm described the fairy tale as "poetic, legend
   historic."^[11] Early scholars such as Karl Wehrhan [de]^[12] Friedrich
   Ranke^[13] and Will Erich Peuckert^[14] followed Grimm's example in
--
   enriched particularly after the 1960s,^[15] by addressing questions of
   performance and the anthropological and psychological insights provided
   in considering legends' social context. Questions of categorising
   legends, in hopes of compiling a content-based series of categories on
   the line of the Aarne–Thompson folktale index, provoked a search for a
   broader new synthesis. In an early attempt at defining some basic
   questions operative in examining folk tales, Friedrich Ranke [de] in
   1925^[16] characterised the folk legend as "a popular narrative with an
   objectively untrue imaginary content", a dismissive position that was
   subsequently largely abandoned.^[17]

   Compared to the highly structured folktale, legend is comparatively
   amorphous, Helmut de Boor noted in 1928.^[18] The narrative content of
   legend is in realistic mode, rather than the wry irony of
   folktale;^[19] Wilhelm Heiske^[20] remarked on the similarity of motifs
   in legend and folktale and concluded that, in spite of its realistic
   mode, legend is not more historical than folktale.

   In Einleitung in der Geschichtswissenschaft (1928), Ernst Bernheim
   asserted that a legend is simply a longstanding rumour.^[21] Gordon
   Allport credited the staying-power of some rumours to the persistent
   cultural state-of-mind that they embody and capsulise;^[22] thus "Urban
   legends" are a feature of rumour.^[23] When Willian Hugh Jansen
   suggested that legends that disappear quickly were "short-term legends"
   and the persistent ones be termed "long-term legends", the distinction
   between legend and rumour was effectively obliterated, Tangherlini
   concluded.^[24]

Christian legenda

   [edit]
   Main article: Legendary (hagiography)

   In a narrow Christian sense, legenda ("things to be read [on a certain
   day, in church]") were hagiographical accounts, often collected in a
   legendary. Because saints' lives are often included in many miracle
   stories, legend, in a wider sense, came to refer to any story that is
   set in a historical context, but that contains supernatural, divine or
   fantastic elements.^[25]
--
   [220px-MataGrifone.jpg] Giants Mata and Grifone, celebrated in the
   streets of Messina, Italy, the second week of August, according to a
   legend are founders of the Sicilian
   city.[220px-H%C3%BCbner_B%C3%BCrkner_Genoveva.jpg] The mediaeval legend
   of Genevieve of Brabant connected her to Treves.

   Hippolyte Delehaye distinguished legend from myth: "The legend, on the
   other hand, has, of necessity, some historical or topographical
   connection. It refers imaginary events to some real personage, or it
   localizes romantic stories in some definite spot."^[27]

   From the moment a legend is retold as fiction, its authentic legendary
   qualities begin to fade and recede: in The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,
   Washington Irving transformed a local Hudson River Valley legend into a
   literary anecdote with "Gothic" overtones, which actually tended to
   diminish its character as genuine legend.^[28]

   Stories that exceed the boundaries of "realism" are called "fables".
   For example, the talking animal formula of Aesop identifies his brief
   stories as fables and not legends. The parable of the Prodigal Son
   would be a legend if it were told as having actually happened to a
   specific son of a historical father. If it included a donkey that gave
   sage advice to the Prodigal Son it would be a fable.^[citation needed]

Urban legend

   [edit]
   Main article: Urban legend
   [220px-Union_Graveyard_II.jpg] The tale of the White Lady who haunts
   Union Cemetery is a variant of the Vanishing hitchhiker
   legend.[220px-Bahay_na_Pula_fvf_2014-1.jpg] Bahay na Pula in the
   Philippines is believed to be haunted by all those who were murdered
   and raped by the Japanese army within the property during World War II.

   Urban legends are a modern genre of folklore that is rooted in local
   popular culture, usually comprising fictional stories that are often
   presented as true, with macabre or humorous elements. These legends can
   be used for entertainment purposes, as well as semi-serious
   explanations for seemingly-mysterious events, such as disappearances
   and strange objects.

   The term "urban legend," as generally used by folklorists, has appeared
   in print since at least 1968.^[30] Jan Harold Brunvand, professor of
   English at the University of Utah, introduced the term to the general
   public in a series of popular books published beginning in 1981.
   Brunvand used his collection of legends, The Vanishing Hitchhiker:
   American Urban Legends & Their Meanings (1981) to make two points:
   first, that legends and folklore do not occur exclusively in so-called
   primitive or traditional societies, and second, that one could learn
   much about urban and modern culture by studying such tales.

   From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
   Genre of storytelling that involves heroic humans
   For other uses, see >>>legend<<< (disambiguation).
   [220px-Lady_Godiva_%28John_Collier%2C_c._1897%29.jpg] In this 1897
   painting of Lady Godiva by John Collier, the authentic historical
   person is fully submerged in the >>>legend<<<, presented in an anachronistic
   high medieval setting.

   A >>>legend<<< is a genre of folklore that consists of a narrative featuring
   human actions, believed or perceived to have taken place in human
   history. Narratives in this genre may demonstrate human values, and
   possess certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. >>>legend<<<,
   for its active and passive participants, may include miracles. Legends
   may be transformed over time to keep them fresh and vital.

   have supernatural origins, and sometimes in that they have some sort of
   historical basis whereas myths generally do not.^[2]^[3] The Brothers
   Grimm defined >>>legend<<< as "folktale historically grounded".^[4] A
   by-product of the "concern with human beings" is the long list of
   legendary creatures, leaving no "resolute doubt" that legends are
   "historically grounded."

   A modern folklorist's professional definition of >>>legend<<< was proposed by
   Timothy R. Tangherlini in 1990:^[5]

     >>>legend<<<, typically, is a short (mono-) episodic, traditional, highly
     ecotypified^[6] historicized narrative performed in a conversational
     mode, reflecting on a psychological level a symbolic representation
--
   [180px-Holger_danske.jpg] Holger Danske, a legendary character

   >>>legend<<< is a loanword from Old French that entered English usage c.
   1340. The Old French noun legende derives from the Medieval Latin
   legenda.^[7] In its early English-language usage, the word indicated a
--
   wished to imply that an event (especially the story of any saint not
   acknowledged in John Foxe's Actes and Monuments) was fictitious. Thus,
   >>>legend<<< gained its modern connotations of "undocumented" and "spurious",
   which distinguish it from the meaning of chronicle.^[10]

   In 1866, Jacob Grimm described the fairy tale as "poetic, >>>legend<<<
   historic."^[11] Early scholars such as Karl Wehrhan [de]^[12] Friedrich
   Ranke^[13] and Will Erich Peuckert^[14] followed Grimm's example in
--
   broader new synthesis. In an early attempt at defining some basic
   questions operative in examining folk tales, Friedrich Ranke [de] in
   1925^[16] characterised the folk >>>legend<<< as "a popular narrative with an
   objectively untrue imaginary content", a dismissive position that was
   subsequently largely abandoned.^[17]

   Compared to the highly structured folktale, >>>legend<<< is comparatively
   amorphous, Helmut de Boor noted in 1928.^[18] The narrative content of
   >>>legend<<< is in realistic mode, rather than the wry irony of
   folktale;^[19] Wilhelm Heiske^[20] remarked on the similarity of motifs
   in >>>legend<<< and folktale and concluded that, in spite of its realistic
   mode, >>>legend<<< is not more historical than folktale.

   In Einleitung in der Geschichtswissenschaft (1928), Ernst Bernheim
   asserted that a >>>legend<<< is simply a longstanding rumour.^[21] Gordon
   Allport credited the staying-power of some rumours to the persistent
   cultural state-of-mind that they embody and capsulise;^[22] thus "Urban
--
   suggested that legends that disappear quickly were "short-term legends"
   and the persistent ones be termed "long-term legends", the distinction
   between >>>legend<<< and rumour was effectively obliterated, Tangherlini
   concluded.^[24]

   day, in church]") were hagiographical accounts, often collected in a
   legendary. Because saints' lives are often included in many miracle
   stories, >>>legend<<<, in a wider sense, came to refer to any story that is
   set in a historical context, but that contains supernatural, divine or
   fantastic elements.^[25]

   [220px-MataGrifone.jpg] Giants Mata and Grifone, celebrated in the
   streets of Messina, Italy, the second week of August, according to a
   >>>legend<<< are founders of the Sicilian
   city.[220px-H%C3%BCbner_B%C3%BCrkner_Genoveva.jpg] The mediaeval >>>legend<<<
   of Genevieve of Brabant connected her to Treves.

   Hippolyte Delehaye distinguished >>>legend<<< from myth: "The >>>legend<<<, on the
   other hand, has, of necessity, some historical or topographical
   connection. It refers imaginary events to some real personage, or it
   localizes romantic stories in some definite spot."^[27]

   From the moment a >>>legend<<< is retold as fiction, its authentic legendary
   qualities begin to fade and recede: in The >>>legend<<< of Sleepy Hollow,
   Washington Irving transformed a local Hudson River Valley >>>legend<<< into a
   literary anecdote with "Gothic" overtones, which actually tended to
   diminish its character as genuine >>>legend<<<.^[28]

   Stories that exceed the boundaries of "realism" are called "fables".
   For example, the talking animal formula of Aesop identifies his brief
   stories as fables and not legends. The parable of the Prodigal Son
   would be a >>>legend<<< if it were told as having actually happened to a
   specific son of a historical father. If it included a donkey that gave
   sage advice to the Prodigal Son it would be a fable.^[citation needed]

   >>>legend<<< may be transmitted orally, passed on person-to-person, or, in
   the original sense, through written text. Jacobus de Voragine's Legenda
   Aurea or "The Golden >>>legend<<<" comprises a series of vitae or instructive
   biographical narratives, tied to the liturgical calendar of the Roman
   Catholic Church. They are presented as lives of the saints, but the

   A >>>legend<<< is a genre of folklore that consists of a narrative featuring
   human actions, believed or perceived to have taken place in human

   Compared to the highly structured folktale, >>>legend<<< is comparatively
