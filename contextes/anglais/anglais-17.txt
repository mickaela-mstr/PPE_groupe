   position as we descend into our all night tour of Fist City and it’s
   most famous resident…MASTER >>>legend<<<!
   The article “The >>>legend<<< of Master >>>legend<<<,” written by Joshuah Bearman
   and appearing in the January 2009 edition of Rolling Stone was my (and
--
   very different e-mails. One was from someone telling me what a great,
   awesome guy Master >>>legend<<< was and that I should get in contact with
   him. A second e-mail told me that Master >>>legend<<< was a nutjob and they
   were sick of writers using him as a representative of the RLSH
--
   repeatedly during my course of writing about RLSH.

   -Tales of Comic Book Bravado and Crimefighting
   Something that appeals to some RLSH about Master >>>legend<<< is that he is
   very dynamic and energetic. He is often documented running, jumping,
--
   wild, action packed, and never a snoozefest.
   Some of them are fantastic and we must take them at Master >>>legend<<<’s
   word, since the only witnesses are Master >>>legend<<< himself and the
   claimed league of frightened criminals who have had the misfortune of
--
     it. This guy known as Big Red has been terrorizing my homeless
     friends but now it's time to meet the >>>legend<<<.
     This guy has tried to evade me because he knows of the whispered
     tales behind shuttered doors of Master >>>legend<<<. He has a few punks
     that do crack, friends, so I got Brimstone to come along for

     been running his mouth out in the streets saying he can kick Master
     >>>legend<<<'s ass. I tell you this, he will need more Cheerios then the
     universe has.

     MySpace blog

   It’s a good story, I see why people would like it. An evildoer is
   threatening the homeless, Master >>>legend<<< shows up and scares him off,
   then parts with some good advice. If Big Red was hassling my homeless
--
   kick his ass, too. Big Red, if you’re reading this- Fist City.
   Master >>>legend<<<’s energy and his war stories are contagious and has won
   him RLSH and non-RLSH fans alike.

   -Acting as a Media Ambassador
   Besides the Rolling Stone article mentioned, Master >>>legend<<< has
   attracted media attention from around the world and for many
--
   some kind and strangely has even had talks about his own cooking show!
   Some RLSH say this media attention is not just good for Master >>>legend<<<,
   but good for RLSH in general.
   Not only that, but Master >>>legend<<< runs his own RLSH forum, leading a
   platoon at the Master >>>legend<<< Army and recently began his own internet
   radio entry- The Master >>>legend<<< Show.
   -Can Shred on Guitar
   One of America’s great exports (besides comic book superheroes) is rock
   n roll, and Master >>>legend<<< likes to shred on the guitar as evidenced by
   video showing him performing with the band Alias Punch, as well as his
   own musical projects. Master >>>legend<<< tells me his favorite guitar
   players are Randy California(Spirit, also played with Jimmy Hendrix),

   -Recognition From Local Law Enforcement
   In "The >>>legend<<< of Master >>>legend<<<," Joshuah Bearman reports that he got
   in touch with a local police Sergeant, who spoke favorably of Master
   >>>legend<<<.

     (The) Sergeant, who’s in charge of vice investigations, took a
     chance and tracked Master >>>legend<<< down. Based on the neighborhood, he
     figured, Master >>>legend<<< might be a good local contact. “And sure
     enough,” the Sergeant tells me, “I start getting calls from Master
     >>>legend<<< with information. And it checks out. Master >>>legend<<< has helped
     put away a few criminals.”

   Additionally, a photo on MySpace shows Master >>>legend<<< receiving a
   certificate of recognition from a police officer.
   ALSO ADDED: RLSHs tell me that Master >>>legend<<< helped Florida residents
   in the aftermath of Hurricane Charly- "He helped cut apart trees on
--
   people out of their houses who were trapped."

   -Tales of Comic Book Bravado and Crimefighting
   The very thing that appeals to some people about Master >>>legend<<< is what
   others use as a criticism- his storytelling. Many of his claims have no

   For example, in his article Joshuah Bearman writes about how Master
   >>>legend<<< and Justice Force (a pre-Team Justice) had a mission to “put the
   stomp on a child molester and his gang of crackheads.”

     plausible, like retrieving a friend’s stolen money, others quite

   In another blog entry, Master >>>legend<<< himself describes a confrontation
   he has in an alleyway with three criminals he encounters while give a

     then take off my helmet and bash him in the head with it, by this
     time they hear the >>>legend<<< yell as I go into Fist City mode. The one
     guy’s head is bleeding and (he) staggers off as the other two are
--
   He goes on to say that he flees the scene when someone comes across it
   and says they are calling the cops. Master >>>legend<<< says “call them” and
   gives the person his card before heading to a pizza joint and ordering
--
   up the good work.
   So Master >>>legend<<< triumphs over three armed street hoods using his WWII
   helmet and habanero pepper he has tucked in his utility belt. Do I have

   -Claims of Metaphysical and Religious Powers
   Master >>>legend<<< has claimed to have various metaphysical and voodoo based
   powers.

   archangel Metatron. It first appeared at the Heroes Network, which led

   -Anti-Homosexual Comments
   Master >>>legend<<< has received some controversy from statements he’s made
   regarding homosexuals. For instance, on March 4, 2010 Atavistik, a RLSH

   -Allegations of Alcohol Abuse
   By this, I’m not talking about the fact the Master >>>legend<<< drinks in the
   comfort of >>>legend<<< Tower. Many people of all professions drink- police
   officers, doctors, ditch diggers- even RLSH bloggers.
   The allegations I am talking about are Master >>>legend<<< drinking and then
   going on patrol or driving the Justice Van. I want to be very clear- I
