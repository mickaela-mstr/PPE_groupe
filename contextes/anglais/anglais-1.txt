   Urban legends (sometimes modern legend, urban myth, or simply legend)
   is a genre of folklore concerning stories about an unusual (usually
--

   These legends can be entertaining but often concern mysterious peril or
   troubling events, such as disappearances and strange objects or
   entities. Urban legends may confirm moral standards, reflect
   prejudices, or be a way to make sense of societal anxieties.^[2]

   In the past, urban legends were most often circulated orally, at
   gatherings and around the campfire for instance. Now, they can be
   spread by any media, including newspapers, mobile news apps, e-mail,
   and most often, social media. Some urban legends have passed through
   the years/decades with only minor changes, in where the time period
   takes place. Generic urban legends are often altered to suit regional
   variations, but the lesson or moral generally remains the same.

   The term "urban legend", as used by folklorists, has appeared in print
   since at least 1968, when it was used by Richard Dorson.^[3] Jan Harold

   the term to the general public in a series of popular books published
   beginning in 1981. Brunvand used his collection of legends, The
   Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends & Their Meanings (1981) to
   make two points: first, that legends and folklore do not occur
   exclusively in so-called primitive or traditional societies, and

   Many urban legends are framed as complete stories with plot and
   characters. The compelling appeal of a typical urban legend is its
   elements of mystery, horror, fear, or humor. Often they serve as
   cautionary tales.^[5] Some urban legends are morality tales that depict
   someone acting in a disagreeable manner, only to wind up in trouble,
--

   Urban legends will often try to invoke a feeling of disgust in the
   reader which tends to make these stories more memorable and potent.
   Elements of shock value can be found in almost every form of urban
   legend and are partially what makes these tales so impactful.^[7] An
   urban legend may include elements of the supernatural or
   paranormal.^[8]

   As Jan Brunvand points out,^[9] antecedent legends including some of
   the motifs, themes and symbolism of the urtexts can readily be

   murders in Texarkana, Texas, United States.^[11]^[12] The urban legend

   The narrator of an urban legend may claim it happened to a friend (or
   to a friend of a friend), which serves to personalize, authenticate and
   enhance the power of the narrative^[14] while distancing the teller
   from the tall tale. Many urban legends depict horrific crimes,
   contaminated foods, or other situations that would potentially affect

   initiation.^[16] A fax retelling this legend received at the Nassau
   County, Florida, fire department was forwarded to police, and from

   Urban legends typically include common elements: the tale is retold on
   behalf of the original witness or participant; dire warnings are often

   identified by first name only or not identified at all.^[17] Such
   legends seem to be believable and even provocative, as some readers are
   led in turn to pass them on, including on social media platforms that

   Persistent urban legends do often maintain a degree of plausibility, as
   in the story a serial killer deliberately hiding in the back seat of a

   legend interrupted the company's business to the point that it stopped

   "FOAFlore" and "FOAFtale". While at least one classic legend, the
   "Death Car", has been shown to have some basis in fact,^[23]

   Social scientists have started to draw on urban legends in order to
   help explain complex socio-psychological beliefs, such as attitudes to
   crime, childcare, fast food, SUVs and other "family" choices.^[26] The
   authors make an explicit connection between urban legends and popular
   folklore, such as Grimm's Fairy Tales, where similar themes and motifs

   The Internet has made it easier both to spread and to debunk urban
   legends.^[28]^[29] For instance, the Usenet newsgroup
   alt.folklore.urban and several other websites, most notably snopes.com,
   focus on discussing, tracking, and analyzing urban legends. The United
   States Department of Energy had a now-discontinued service called
   Hoaxbusters^[30] that dealt with computer-distributed hoaxes and
   legends.^[31] The most notable such hoaxes are known as creepypastas,
   which are typically horror stories written anonymously. Although most

   Television shows such as Urban Legends, Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction,
   and later Mostly True Stories: Urban Legends Revealed, feature
   re-enactments of urban legends, detailing the accounts of the tales and
   (typically later in an episode) revealing any factual basis they may
   have. The Discovery Channel TV show MythBusters (2003–2016) tried to
   prove or disprove several urban legends by attempting to reproduce them
   using the scientific method. ^[33]

   The 1998 film Urban Legend featured students discussing popular urban
   legends while at the same time falling victim to killings re-enacting
   them.^[34] The 1999 film The Blair Witch Project purposefully
   positioned itself as an urban legend to gain viral hype and succeeded
   in fooling many that it was based on a real disappearance.^[35] The

   What I Call Urban Myths. The 1994 comics anthology the Big Book of
   Urban Legends, written by Robert Boyd, Jan Harold Brunvand, and Robert
   Loren Fleming, featured 200 urban legends, displayed as
   comics.^[citation needed]

   The British writer Tony Barrell has explored urban legends in a
   long-running column in The Sunday Times. These include the story that

   As with traditional urban legends, many internet rumors are about
   crimes or crime waves – either fictional or based on real events that

   problematic, both because they purport to be relevant modern news and
   because they do not follow the typical patterns of urban legends.^[44]

   Some legends are medical folklore, such as the claim that eating
   watermelon seeds will result in a watermelon growing in the stomach, or

   Internet urban legends are those spread through the internet, as
   through Usenet or email^[46] or more recently through other social

   Paranormal urban-legend stories usually involve someone encountering
   something supernatural, such as a cryptid^[49]—for instance, Bigfoot or
