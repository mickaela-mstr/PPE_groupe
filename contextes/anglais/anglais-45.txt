What is Zelda's Legend?

--
   Basically, through the long and short of it, the primary focus of every
   game is on Link, so the title does seem a little off, but "Legend of
   Link" doesn't quite have the same ring to it (not to mention the
--
   Link, and even Ganon (or Ganondorf), so does the title link itself* to
   more than just a character? What is Zelda's Legend?

       Zelda may have had a lot of legends, but Link got an adventure.

   The first The Legend of Zelda game was focused on rescuing Zelda from
   the clutches of Gannon, as his name was originally spelt. The decision

   In the immediate sequel they dropped "The Legend" and opted for Zelda
   II: The Adventure of Link. This sequel wasn't as well received, so as

   As for what The Legend is, you have to look at the first game in the
   timeline, The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. In that game this Zelda
   is not a princess, but the first human/mortal reincarnation of the
   goddess Hylia. This is further explained at the back of the Hyrule
   Historia book in a translated manga titled The Legend is Born, a page
   of which I have taken a photo of.

       I think it's fair to say that at the time of release of the first
       game, the legend simply was the story of the game. Tons of games
       were called "legend of <something>" at the time, and those were
       always games where the story was the legend the title referred to.
       Zelda was no exception.

     * @Kevin ....and then it became a loooong legend. Or collection or
       legends. Maybe the name should be changed to "The Saga of Zelda"

   There really is an in-universe "Legend of Zelda", mentioned in the
   instruction manual of Zelda II as told by Impa:

     "Link, the time has come when I must tell you the legend of Zelda
     handed down in Hyrule. It is said that long ago, when Hyrule was one

   name of the game, but I always thought of this text as the simplified,
   summarized version of the legend.

     middle of this chaos, in a little kingdom in the land of Hyrule, a
     legend was being handed down from generation to generation, the
     legend of the 'Triforce'; golden triangles possessing mystical
     powers.
