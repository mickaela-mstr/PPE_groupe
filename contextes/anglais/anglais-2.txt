Legend

--
   Genre of storytelling that involves heroic humans
   For other uses, see Legend (disambiguation).
   [220px-Lady_Godiva_%28John_Collier%2C_c._1897%29.jpg] In this 1897
   painting of Lady Godiva by John Collier, the authentic historical
   person is fully submerged in the legend, presented in an anachronistic
   high medieval setting.

   A legend is a genre of folklore that consists of a narrative featuring
   human actions, believed or perceived to have taken place in human
   history. Narratives in this genre may demonstrate human values, and
   possess certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend,
   for its active and passive participants, may include miracles. Legends
   may be transformed over time to keep them fresh and vital.

   Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being
   entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely
   doubted.^[1] Legends are sometimes distinguished from myths in that
   they concern human beings as the main characters and do not necessarily

   historical basis whereas myths generally do not.^[2]^[3] The Brothers
   Grimm defined legend as "folktale historically grounded".^[4] A
   by-product of the "concern with human beings" is the long list of
   legendary creatures, leaving no "resolute doubt" that legends are
   "historically grounded."

   A modern folklorist's professional definition of legend was proposed by
   Timothy R. Tangherlini in 1990:^[5]

     Legend, typically, is a short (mono-) episodic, traditional, highly
     ecotypified^[6] historicized narrative performed in a conversational

   Legend is a loanword from Old French that entered English usage c.
   1340. The Old French noun legende derives from the Medieval Latin

   (introduced in the 1510s) meaning a collection or corpus of
   legends.^[8]^[9] This word changed to legendry, and legendary became

   acknowledged in John Foxe's Actes and Monuments) was fictitious. Thus,
   legend gained its modern connotations of "undocumented" and "spurious",
   which distinguish it from the meaning of chronicle.^[10]

   In 1866, Jacob Grimm described the fairy tale as "poetic, legend
   historic."^[11] Early scholars such as Karl Wehrhan [de]^[12] Friedrich

   performance and the anthropological and psychological insights provided

   questions operative in examining folk tales, Friedrich Ranke [de] in
   1925^[16] characterised the folk legend as "a popular narrative with an
   objectively untrue imaginary content", a dismissive position that was

   Compared to the highly structured folktale, legend is comparatively
   amorphous, Helmut de Boor noted in 1928.^[18] The narrative content of
   legend is in realistic mode, rather than the wry irony of
   folktale;^[19] Wilhelm Heiske^[20] remarked on the similarity of motifs
   in legend and folktale and concluded that, in spite of its realistic
   mode, legend is not more historical than folktale.

   In Einleitung in der Geschichtswissenschaft (1928), Ernst Bernheim
   asserted that a legend is simply a longstanding rumour.^[21] Gordon
   Allport credited the staying-power of some rumours to the persistent
   cultural state-of-mind that they embody and capsulise;^[22] thus "Urban
   legends" are a feature of rumour.^[23] When Willian Hugh Jansen
   suggested that legends that disappear quickly were "short-term legends"
   and the persistent ones be termed "long-term legends", the distinction
   between legend and rumour was effectively obliterated, Tangherlini
   concluded.^[24]

   From the moment a legend is retold as fiction, its authentic legendary
   qualities begin to fade and recede: in The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,
   Washington Irving transformed a local Hudson River Valley legend into a
   literary anecdote with "Gothic" overtones, which actually tended to
   diminish its character as genuine legend.^[28]

   For example, the talking animal formula of Aesop identifies his brief
   stories as fables and not legends. The parable of the Prodigal Son
   would be a legend if it were told as having actually happened to a
   specific son of a historical father. If it included a donkey that gave

   Legend may be transmitted orally, passed on person-to-person, or, in
   the original sense, through written text. Jacobus de Voragine's Legenda

   Urban legends are a modern genre of folklore that is rooted in local
   popular culture, usually comprising fictional stories that are often
   presented as true, with macabre or humorous elements. These legends can

   Brunvand used his collection of legends, The Vanishing Hitchhiker:

   primitive or traditional societies, and second, that one could learn
